With all of that being said, they're so sturdy and fade resistant. Today I'm changing the bow on my front door, it's in perfect condition and been hanging outside since April",

I have a smallish tree (5 1/2') and so one set was enough... they are quite lovely - the photos are very nice representations of the snowflakes.  I had thought I might put a little clear sparkle glue on a few - but honestly, I decided they were perfect without any embellishment - personal choice of course. One thing that was disappointing... how stingy they were with the jute rope for hanging them!  I didn't have enough to hand all the snowflakes - short just one - I could see right away that I needed to be very careful with it - so I was VERY careful.. giving each one JUST ENOUGH to tie the knot.  The jute is cheap - so it would be nice if they gave a bit extra.  The wooden box they come in was wrapped with a bit of thinner jute - so I robbed a bit of that to finish the last snowflake.

It's really easy to adjust, too. The stone is about the size of my thumb. It's very smooth and fun to touch for this tactile person. Without adjusting the string, it falls right below my chest which is a good length on me. I would consider adjusting it so it fell a few inches above my chest, but I think the excess string would be visible then. It's a very nice necklace and I think it would make a great gift!",

It is scentless.<br /><br />It also has good ingredients of Grape Seed Oil, Beeswax, Olive Fruit Oil, Shea Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E, and Rosemary Leaf Extract.<br /><br />The current price of $11.55 for two 0.5 ounce tubes comes to $ 85.78 each which I consider competitively priced. I definitely like its moisturizing ability as well as its portability. Note that I would never use this for more than small areas on my body like hands, heels, and elbows. For a full body moisturizer, I would just buy lotion. However, for a baby this is perfect. Note that the skin will have a shine to it after application.<br /><br />PS Be careful when removing the seal or the entire label may be pulled off as can be seen in my photos.",

    "text": "I dropped my previous very cheap wall clock and broke it when I was changing time twelve days ago when we sprung ahead for Daylight Savings Time. Since I wanted something more substantial and different and since I love craft items, I settled on this clock.<br /><br />I decided to use a beautiful photo of one of my three cats. I attached the photo so that you can see the one that was used and how the clock came out. I picked the mahogany wood since there was no super light wood available. The clock itself came out great. The numbers on the clock are perfect. The reproduced photo is almost perfect. What I mean by that is that it is more muted than the actual photograph but that is to be expected. There is a long channel on the back of the clock that starts with a circle to slip onto a screw head and then the clock can be slid to the left along the channel to adhere to the wall. This works perfectly as long as the head on the screw (not included) is small.<br /><br />Obviously, this clock is too big and too dark where I put it, but it is going to stay there as my other clock's replacement. It would look best in an area by itself or with more room away from my other framed picture. It would also look better with very light wood like the frame color of the canvas below it (see photos of the clock on the wall).<br /><br />The only negative is that the dials arrived squished against each other. I had to pull the second and minute hands apart a little bit and tighten the knob on front. The AA battery (not included) goes in the back. The mechanism in back did turn out of kilter when setting the clock, so I had to be careful to keep that in place as well. That is also to be expected based on other clocks I have with this type mechanism.<br /><br />As a side note, my cat's reaction to this clock is extremely surprising. About two hours after putting this up, my cat looked at his photo on the clock. This is more than interesting because cats are not self-aware. I had to take a photo of this, which I attached here. He approves but he looks puzzled why his likeness is up there on the wall.<br /><br />In summary, I love the quality of this timepiece and the results. The time mechanism itself, however, is problematic during shipping and can get out of alignment. The photo will also be more subdued than the original. The price is perfect for this handmade gem. The turnaround time from order placement to fulfillment and receipt is fabulous--in total it took 12 calendar days. I placed my order on March 7 and received my treasure today on March 19, 2020.  I love it and wish I had a better place to put it that would highlight its workmanship.",

One size will fit adult or child by simple tightening or loosening of pull strings. Designed unisex the center heart shape bead may not be perceived by all as such! Tbh, ours was gifted to 19yr old boy from 3yr bff nephew- and he loves to wear 24/7 because of meaning to him. But something to keep in mind for recipient.<br /><br />The handmade feature elevates the effort/thoughtfulness of any gift..<br />I wish that was made known to the recipient when gifting. Including that fact on the tag or insert card- it's a great feature to let it be known. Note to seller! For price point being higher.. I feel using a sterling silver metal center bead- one that would not tarnish or fade would be best. A small increase in cost to make but would justify price being more acceptable- well, creating longevity for wearing!<br /><br />Overall, very nicely crafted bracelet- sold at higher price point than most- only reason for 4 star.

Simply x4 corner tack right below edge to create a shelf for item to rest on.. circular head will extend over poster to secure from movement and preserve poster perfectly!!<br /><br />Ideal gift for one who could use support and confidence as this can become a “personal rally cry” or reminder.

Anytime a bougie bubble bath fits the bill..!!<br /><br />These leave soft skin nothing irritating which is a plus for sensitive skin. Although scent is present while opening pouch-  it dissipates when salts are placed in water.. leaving a saltwater aroma! Very eye catching with presentation window.. but, in use they don't have a big “wow” factor- I realize, to some that's appealing. But so all are aware- no fizz, color swirling, bubbles, etc. Prob. safe to assume these have healing properties from the salts- but, no product ingredient listing or info. on item to back this up.<br /><br />I love the idea of homemade and supporting “mom+pop” shop goods.. truly I do!! Only, I find this pricier then most for an outcome of soft bathwater. This is definitely gift worthy and that aspect is not disappointing and it's best feature.. to give a personalized spoiler- I find it hard to justify $20 for a pound of bath salts in any color/flavor.. in a throwaway pouch.<br /><br />Note: scrub/rinse bathtub after use!

I have it in my family room, which is plenty big, and I've set it on the coffee table with the aroma sticks in the original down position. My chair is about 4 ft from the bottle, and it gives off a nice, potent scent, but it's definitely NOT over or under potent!<br />I highly recommend this item!  You will LOVE IT!",

I won't go into detail on how these are made, but the process shines through in the finished product. I ordered this Memento Mori coin necklace and due to postal errors, it was returned to sender after making it all the way to my mailbox.  I contacted the seller and they were immediately responsive and offered to ship the item again at no charge.  This sort of customer service is hard to come by, and it's nice to see that the coins aren't the only thing old fashioned.  I truly love the necklace.  It is somewhat heavy (.999 fine silver), and the weight serves as a gentle reminder that it is there.  The chain is pretty basic and a nice bonus, but I wasn't ordering it for the chain.  Overall, if you're on the fence about paying a little more for a conversation starting necklace, just buy this one.  After you get it, you'll be looking to see what else they have for sale as I am!",

Im going to try to wear it on my index (other bigger) finger, but it's loose... Idk if it can be fixed?<br />I love everything else about this ring. I got the darker patina.<br />The packaging made it so it couldnt get stolen by my mail people (they have delivered empty packages before that were suppose to contain rings--i can tell by the flaps that they worked them out of the packing/envolope....USPS, you have theives).<br /><br />UPDATE: ring turns finger green, with time. Wore for about 1 month then it started to turn my finger green whenever i wore it. Now i can't wear it :( took 2 stars off due to this.",

I will update should anything happen to this one but sizing it up after arriving at my door I can tell this is one bamf dopp kit. Horween chromed leather and ykk zipper make this a great deal. Yes it is smaller than most dopp kits but still large enough to fit your travel essentials in. I can fit my full size braun electric razor, and full size: toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, & deodorant. In addition to those I can fit several travel size bottles of various things in here as well. If you honestly need more room than this, consider a makeup bag.",

I wanted a Swiss Mountain Dog and a Rhodesian Ridgeback and they look great - no doubt what breeds the images are representing. There's a grooved hanger attached on the back for use with a nail, but I added a wire to it and attached it to our actual doorbell instead.<br /><br />Normally,  I would never include mail drama in my overall review of any product from Amazon, but the sign is from an independent party and that's a bit different. It was exactly 22 days from order to receipt and I find that excessive and puzzling. This is a basic template design that requires very little extra work for the personalization so three weeks is way too long to wait.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the sign will hopefully save me from buying yet another doorknob because my Plott Hound has lost his mind over the doorbell. And it's definitely earned some smiles from my husband and even our UPS man this morning - he did not ring the bell!",

I bought this to give my 3 month old niece. She has a 2 year old older sister, so they literally have everything they could want or need for her. I was excited to come across this keepsake box on here, because it's the perfect gift for a baby. It's bigger than I thought it would be, but that's a good thing. It's the perfect size: big enough to hold lots of things in a variety of shapes and sizes, but not so big that it's awkward or anything.  This is a high quality and beautifully crafted wooden box. It is unfinished, but sanded well and very smooth. It's nice enough that my brother and SIL could leave it as-is if they don't want to stain it, and it'll be perfect. I had it customized  with my nieces' name and birthday on the top, and a quote from the book, “On The Night You Were Born” on the bottom. It turned out absolutely wonderful. I was surprised how quickly it arrived after ordering. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. I love everything about the box, it was well packed and shipping was fast, I wouldn't hesitate to order it  again, and I would recommend it to anyone.",

I guess I want to smudge myself in a way, haha. So I spray and walk through it, or I spray directly on me, or I spray the area that I am doing my thought work. It just adds to the ritual. Has a pleasant, comforting smell.<br /><br />What made me choose this is that it seems thoughtfully done, not just mass produced.

I bought these for use all fall- perfect amount of flair for crisp fall days going into Halloween, and straight through Thanksgiving. I like wearing stud earrings for their simplicity and subtly, and these are exactly what I wanted. Comes with care instructions, and the earrings are tucked into a small lidded box. Plain, but gift worthy.",

I am concerned about receiving the wrong set of products. I chose very carefully based on what products I want the scent at, and I received different items. Hopefully that is a fluke, and not a regular occurrence for customers.  I wanted mint lip balm but received plain, etc. It was all different.. so a disappointed on that.<br /><br />The large body balm stick is soft and silky. I wonder if it is because of the heat that it is so soft to the touch) and will be hard come winter?). It just melts, glides across skin so I suspect that even if it turns hard that it would instant melt when expose to warm skin. Smaller lotion stick is similar. I thought they absorbed well into skin.<br /><br />Bathbombs aren't limited to use in bath. I find bathbombs are also nice tossed in with a foot soak bath.",

It did do a pretty decent job in protecting my skin from further irritation and problems when it was already irritated.<br />However, it is one of the messiest balms I have ever used and the container that this balm comes in should be changed out because it is not suited for these types of things. This balm comes in a shallow tin that is not air-tight, at all, and therefore leaks with the slightest shake or turn of the container. They do package the balm in plastic when it is sent out, so thank goodness for that because you could see oil all in the bag when it arrived. I thought it might have just been from shipping but it continued to leak and everything even after being opened because the balm itself never fully solidifies but stays in this middle of half liquid, half mush state. I finally had to put it into a glass container that I had in order for it to stop leaking and making a mess all over everything.<br />While the product is pretty good, the packaging makes it to where I do not want to use this stuff again because the mess isn't worth it.

It doesn't smell anything even close to a cupcake or pumpkin spice. It's more of the artificial cinnamon smell and even that's not good. Also, I don't get why it's a light pink when it's supposed to be pumpkin cupcake but that's not even the issue. This scent was awful and gave me a huge headache. Do not like it at all.<br />I do really like the Pumpkin Latte though as it has a very nice pumpkin spice smell with a hint of vanilla that levels it out. It isn't highly scented but my warmer is in a small room and the smell is nice and I can smell it nicely in that room. I can't however smell it anywhere else throughout the house, which is a shame. I use many different waxes from all types of companies and usually, I can smell the scent, even faintly, throughout the house, not with this one though. I still really like the scent though, and it wouldn't hurt for it to be tripled scented than what it is now.<br />The pumpkin spice scent is okay. It isn't horrible but it isn't that great either. It doesn't have a lot of fragrance and doesn't last but only a few hours if that.<br />Overall these were some of the worst wax cubes that I have bought and I DO NOT recommend these at all. If they changed the scents and added more scents to these, then maybe that would make these better but as they are right now, I will NEVER buy these again. I would much rather spend the money and get Scenty wax melts.",

I've missed having pretty smelling hair.<br /><br />My only criticism of this is that it leaves my hair a little dull looking. Other than that, it is clean and smells good. The clay would be a great way to travel with shampoo. As far as I know, it wouldn't be banned by TSA for airline travel. It would also be good for camping, or any other situation when you can't carry a liquid. It does get a little clumpy if you keep the container in the shower.

It went on evenly (even though it does take a bit longer to dry than regular polish ... so I messed a few nails up but with a top coat, doesn't look that bad!) although it does feel bumpy due to the glitter ... the top coat smoothed it out.  Very shiny and after a day of typing (I use the tops of my fingers), haven't had a chip yet!  I'm rather impressed ... not sure about the color and me (it changes to a darker pink and somewhat of a purple depending on the light in the room) but it's not bad ... I'm going to try a more neutral color, too ... I do like the sparkle and my grandson noticed the glittering right off the bat!  I think you get what you pay for ... the more expensive polishes seem to last longer and for me (with the top coat), hasn't chipped or peeled yet!  Yeah!  I'll definitely purchase more!",

    "text": "We ordered two of these foam hats, one for our two year old who loves dinosaurs, and one for mom, who loves unicorns. The little one loved his foam gator hat and was clearly in awe of mom's unicorn one. Mom loved both hats too. We keep a plastic crown on hand for celebrating birthdays. The unicorn hat would be a delightful new addition to adorn the head of the birthday person. If we can get it off of mom's head, that is. Our family gives these foam hats a resounding 5 stars!",

This is a review for the gator hat though, so let's focus on that one. Our two year old loved it from the moment he first saw it. He ran right to it, put it on, then proceeded to dance, run, and crawl around all over the place, with plenty of growling and roaring tossed in. This foam hat is a 5 star product for the sheer delight it brought our little one.",

Inside the heart is a lovely, very feminine silver pendant. A single, large moissanite stone is set inside a setting that reminds me of lopsided, colliding hearts. It dangles from a thin, sterling silver chain. The center stone does have some sparkle without looking like cheap costume jewelry. Inside is a packet that includes a polishing cloth, authenticity card and small note. Some may think this necklace is overpriced, but the packaging definitely accounts for some of the cost.

The salts are a combination of Epsom and Mediterranean Sea salt, which is very soothing and relaxing. It is sulfate, paragon, gluten and phthalate free.

It moisturizes, nourishes and softens wet or dry hair. There are a combination of several ingredients that do this: they include dragon's blood resin, ginger, neem, olive and castor oil, rosemary and vitamin E - all of which are believed to stimulate hair growth.

    "text": "When I selected this DIY activity, I expected a little more. I thought I would get 4 complete art kits for a sip and paint event. I plan to use them for my upcoming birthday. I plan to have 3 friends over, give them a pre-printed canvas (this one is cute and says “Queen”) and let them be creative while sipping some wine and munching on appetizers. So, when I received this set, I was surprised to see (especially considering the price) that this only came with the canvases, no paints or brushes? The canvas is cute, but I mean for $60 (on Amazon), they could have provided 3 cheap brushes and 6 paints with each canvas! So, here is my biggest complaint: if this is a paint and sip kit, why not provide everyone with a complete kit, which would include the brushes and paints? That would make more sense. For me, ordering this kind of kit is for convenience. Who has time to run out and try to find the accompanying materials? That means more expense and more time spent running around. In conclusion, I am disappointed….and can only give this 3 stars.",

And that is exactly what I plan to do.<br />They would make the perfect gift (i.e., birthday, Mother's Day, just because) for someone you like or love.<br />My only hesitation in giving this product 5 stars is the price. I know and understand that bath products are expensive, but these 4 costs $40, which accounts for $10 each. That seems a little pricey. 4.5 stars.",

I use it on my body, especially my feet (great on my heels) once I get out of the shower. I haven't tried it on my hair, but definitely can see the benefit(s). It initially looks greasy but dissipates quickly. I have dry or sensitive skin and have had absolutely no problem with rashes or irritation.

She replaced them for free. But then a week later mine broke. I still have an extra bracelet from the set she sent but I'm almost scared to wear it because they are so fragile. Also, the bracelets weren't put thru harsh conditions for them to break, the links just arent fully closed so the string slides off. And when you try to tie them back it's really hard.

I can't get the barrette around my hair - I have to use a band first - which defeats both it being pretty and it's use to begin with.  I can attach it, but not around 'all' of my hair.  So I should have ordered the larger ones, because I was trying to omit the band altogether as they give my headaches which is why I used them back in the day.

    "text": "I have always wanted to have a pearl necklace.  Although it is not my usual style, I thought I would try one out.  The problem is that I did not have any earrings appropriate to wear with it.  That is where these came in.<br /><br />HOW THESE ARE PACKAGED<br />This is a beautiful set very appropriate for gift giving.  It comes in a cardboard sheath.  Inside there is a very beautiful blue box with a nice expensive looking finish on it.  Inside the box there is a plastic bag with a pair of earrings, silicone backs on them, extra backs, a white velvet bag, and a cleaning cloth.<br /><br />QUALITY<br />The earring pearls are beautiful in tone and quality.  They are shiny as you can see from the photo.  The camera reflection is showing on the pearl.  The tone of the pearl is what I call a rose taupe tint to it.  It is very slight, but it is warm and beautiful.<br /><br />SIZE<br />The size of these is not quite as big as I hoped it would be.  My necklace is from the same company and the color matches perfectly,, but the size although listed as the same is bigger on the necklace.  Nevertheless, it looks good together and I am happy with it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This set of earrings is really nice.  It is good quality, well packaged, and a decent price.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  Although I wish they were just a tiny bit larger, I still like them very much and the color is stunning.",

This is a wonderful piece for a newbie of Herkimer or Herkimer lover like I am. The stones are not without inclusions, but that's not to say that they all have inclusions. Herkimer is known for its quality and its clarity. It's also a more dense and strong stone so it will stand up to a person that is a little harsher on their jewelry.

Well I finally met my match because I can't stop wearing this necklace. First of all it is Superbly made. From the beautiful Hurcombe light right down to the chain. I have had no problems with tarnishing and because the Herkimer is a very hearty stone I've had no problem with chipping  or breaking. I have worn it so much that he needed to clean it, and I just did so with a little soft soap under the faucet with warm water the Herkimer sparkle right up. (I know this isn't the preferred method but it works for me. And since I'm writing this review I'm gonna keep it 100%.). I've worn it with a jean and T-shirts and I also wore it to a wedding with a very lovely MichaelKors dress.  I love this necklace so much I ordered one for my sister-in-law.

Nancy of Baby Rozen (the seller) worked with me to find the perfect fabric to coordinate with the color of my mixer.  The pockets are the perfect size to hold instructions and tools.  Actually the pocket that hold the instructions also holds the flat blender attachment with no problem. The craftsmanship is exquisite.  It was well packed when sent, and enclosed in a protective plastic cover, which would have shielded from any foreseeable accident while with the Post Office.  Be sure when you wash it (which I have not yet), to remember the instructions and wash in cold water (it is a cotton cover) and air dry it to avoid shrinkage. I am totally delighted with this purchase!!!!",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:93dfa2de786874f465793f0befe643ce]] I bought these backflow incense cones for my \"smoke fountain\", since my fountain has not been serving its true, intended purpose for many YEARS. Finally since 2020 is seemly now the year of staying at home & work on personal things that may be incomplete or in need of repair or attention in general, I wanted re-align my smoke fountain's purpose, besides it being an ashtray for my sage or palo santo while I sit still & gather my thoughts with open eyes, meditate, cleanse my house of negativity.<br /><br />While the cone itself is thick & sturdy and its frankincense & myrrh aroma/blend is great, not to mention it is bigger than expected size when it comes to incense cones, I sadly cannot recommend this product for the intended purpose I bought it for. For that, I should stick to buying incense sticks and will consider it for a future order with the seller.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The seller seems very nice, and received the cones in a timely matter. She added a incense stick sample, as well as a lovely thank you note with your order with a lollipop attached that I enjoyed.<br /><br />If you burn this as a regular cone, it definitely admits smokes and smells very nice. You feel calm and protected. It is also nice to see burn.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sadly, as a backflow smoke fountain cone, it fails miserably, as shown in my video and pics. It will temporary provide smoke trickling down for my smoke mountain but then it will just ride up the smoke and I have to re-light it as well, as it stops burning as well",

Very lightweight and can not tell I have it on. I do not recommend sleeping in it as it delicate. It is just shy of being the size of a dime and about the same thickness. It would also be the perfect piece to attach to a chain style charm bracelet ( via a jump-ring that is on it now).<br />Came in a gifting box on a company logo card.

I did buy it for a ‘decorative' piece that I was going to place on a tray that's on the ottoman in my living room for its colors, shape and size. When I received it I almost thought I received the wrong one - it didn't have the nice colors that are shown in the online pictures. They appeared to be ‘dull' looking and the bottom in particular was not the pretty blue colors but more black and gray with a little bit of white. I'm going to return it and look for something else to put on the tray as I have tried 3 different pieces of these crystals that didn't have the ‘look' I wanted. I will say that this has a sharp point at the top (that could hurt a child that thinks it's a toy) and it's also fairly heavy for something this size. However it could be a good paperweight. For this reason I give it 3 stars - I can't honestly say anything about the efficacy of the ‘healing' properties of the crystals. (I did read many reviews on this crystal and other ones as well that stated how well they did work as advertised. To each his own! I don't want to judge someone else and their beliefs!)",

It is packaged in a gorgeous box with an evil eye charm. The box also contains a little present of a Turkish coffee and a tea, a very sweet touch! The care put into the packaging of this planner was 5-star luxury. As for the planner itself, it is made from very high quality leather. The edges are burnished, which caused a bit of black dye color transfer. In order to prevent the dye from staining the interior of my handbag, I wiped the planner thoroughly with leather wipes and then sealed every edge with a thin layer of clear nail polish. It did the trick 100%. My one suggestion to Galen leather would be to make one available without the burnished edges. I love the worn leather look! Overall, this planner is worth many times over what they are charging for it. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you!",

I've always wanted a necklace like this, and it was a dream to open, regardless of who the packaging was addressed to lol.<br />The moissanite diamond is so sparkly!!!  And the back of the setting has a heart, which makes me love it more!  It sparkles even in terrible basement lighting, as shown in my video.  The necklace is so pretty, and I was surprised with how long the chain was. I don't know why I thought it was supposed to be a 16 in chain.  I may switch out the chain to something shorter for me, I have it at the shortest setting, so the tail is quite long on me.<br />Regardless of that, I absolutely love this necklace!  I've been wearing it every day since I received it, and am wearing it right now as I type this review out!  It looks luxurious, but it's simplicity makes it versatile.  I've worn it with tees and cocktail dresses, it works with any outfit. Love it, and would recommend it to anyone that would like to gift it to someone, or to anyone in search of a simple yet fabulous piece of jewelry that can be worn with absolutely anything.  I'm very happy with this purchase!",

    "text": "EDIT:  Vendor DID make name larger.  While I wish it were even larger, GARDEN is still much larger, it now looks acceptable in size and I will be giving to the family tomorrow.<br /><br />The size of the name was my biggest issue and now you can see the name clearly from more than just a few feet away.<br /><br />I was assured this sign is rust proof and the scratches, marks are meant to be there to look more rustic.<br />If it rusts, I will adjust review, but I am taking vendor's word for that.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE:<br />IF you are looking for a cute, casual personalized tin sign, MY ONE SUGGESTION is to ASK VENDOR to make name larger, even if you have to pay more.  MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE!<br />______________________________________________________________________<br /><br />FIRST, I wasn't expecting a high end sign.  A tin sign was fine.  And that part is as I figured it would be.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I got the BIGGEST of the options because I wanted it to stand out.  A memorial sign for one of the gardens a friend had done because of Covid there was no service and this was my way of honoring him.<br /><br />YOU HAVE NO IDEA how small the name really looks, even the images put up doesn't really bring it home til you see it.  In fact, before I even ordered, I asked if the name could be in CAPS to make it bigger and at that time had no idea just how SMALL it would look.  I said I wanted the sign whether or not could be done in caps.<br /><br />FIRST, it took longer to get here than I was told, but I will add that under vendor comments.<br /><br />SECOND, I got it today and GARDEN is big and the letters in the name are about....ONE THIRD the size, maybe even less, of the letters in GARDEN!  It looks RIDICULOUS.<br /><br />THIRD, the lettering is SCRATCHED, badly.  It's not part of a distressed look or to go with the faux wood grain on the tin sign, it's SCRATCHED.  Which means it can RUST when it rains.  And there are LOTS of scratches.  I have added a zoomed in close up.  I was told it was meant to be this way, but you can FEEL the scratches and it makes the TINY lettering on the name look even worse.<br /><br />FOUR, YES, came in a cardboard box, but not even a light layer of saran wrap around to keep from bumps or bruises, much less any bubble wrap.<br /><br />I have decided NOT to give to family because I'm embarrassed by it.  And embarrassed no one will even be able to READ the name even on the BIGGEST option of sign from the fence it will go on.  You can see GARDEN from yards away, but the SMALL lower case name, you can't be more than feet away to notice and even then it's SO DWARFED by the word GARDEN.<br /><br />BUT BEWARE....just getting the bigger sign doesn't mean you will see the name unless you are pretty close up.<br />I HAVE NO IDEA who thought making the NAME in a sign you obviously want personalized with that person's name, spending the money and time waiting for it, SOOOOO SMALL.",

For those who know about Hag Stones there are many different beliefs in their energy - to be honest, I feel \"all\" of the various uses of when wearing all 3 of my necklaces. This one just arrived, I can't wait to wear it - it's the \"Luck Hag Stone Open Ring Necklace for Women, Half Circle Natural Sandstone Pendant.\" Just wonderful - including, as always, an excellent, high quality leather necklace that it hangs on.",

I wasn't expecting anything large, but for over $30 I definitely expected it to look more like the size it looks like in the picture and not so tiny that it will barely be noticeable when I wear it, which is very, very disappointing, not only due to how it looks, but the cost for something as small as it is.

If you are a Hellraiser girl like me this is an absolute must to any collection...even if you don't like the movie...which in that case what is wrong with you...it's still a must! Well that's my two cents and final thoughts are great detailed box coming from a great seller and maker mind you...those two details right there are few and far between on Amazon! Now to continue on my horror movie collecting journey.....but I'll be back!<br /><br />Update: Received my new Hellraiser box and it's fantastic. The damages before came from the shipping service and not the seller. Very overjoyed!",

When I opened it and peeled back the paper backing I noticed that there was already a bubble in the decal before I even applied it. It appeared to be because there was a fold and slight rip in the backing.That was disappointing but you could barely see it. That's the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Like said in previous reviews it's super easy to apply if you follow the directions. I absolutely love the personalization. So now at clinical and school other people won't be snatching my cup by accident. This material is very high quality and doesn't even look like a sticker once applied to the cup. I have washed this since and it never budged even with the bubble that was in the decal when I got it. Love, love, love these and I'll be ordering more for my laptop, travel mug, water bottle, and backpack. Thank you so much!!!",

    "text": "Based on the reviews and photos, I thought this would be perfect, but it has definitely not met my expectations. I sent an edited photo of my dog, cropped exactly how I wanted it, along with an email asking that if any further editing was required to please let me know prior to making the box. No one ever contacted me regarding the photo.<br /><br />I received the product today. It's not as sturdy as I expected. The color does look like the stain that I inquired about previous to purchase. Worst of all, my dog's photo is cropped in way more than the photo I provided. I understand that the photo is in a sort of a frame so a portion of the edge will not show, but if I was made aware of how much of the photo was going to be chopped off, I would have added a border to the photo to prevent the problem, or asked the seller to do so.<br /><br />The engraving part is OK, but there are some blemishes in the wood. Overall, I think this is overpriced and lacking quality control. Not to mention that when I sent an email about the tracking not moving for a week, no one bothered to even respond to me. Where is the customer service?",

    "text": "I have some wood carvers in my family and my Uncle carved a spoon out of olive wood with vines and flowers, I treasure it as he is no longer here.  This piece really called to me and I had to have it!  It's a really lovely piece to keep out for display as well.  It's packed in a small muslin bag which if at all possible made it more endearing.  Great for a gift for any occasion including hostess or housewarming gift if you can part with it.",
