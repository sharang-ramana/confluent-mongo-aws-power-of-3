Both of these items appeared to be epoxy resin handcrafted items. The pyramid is very pretty: it contains gold sparkle ( gold leaf?) upon which sits a copper coil, and what appears to be a ~20 mm amethyst “globe”. Mine did not come with the wooden platform and lights, unfortunately. When I tried to find the contact info for the company, I couldn't seem to locate it. The box states “Made in China”.

He even invented an “orgone machine” and evidently had a following until he was shut down by what some say were the feds. So, of course with a story like that, I knew I had to get this to check it out! My orgonite/resin/amethyst/copper coil/ gold leaf flaked pendant and pyramid arrived in a sturdy, pretty, giftable  cardboard box, within which resided a velvet draw string bag containing these handmade amulets. Unfortunately, I did not receive either the wooden base and/ or lights to use as a stand. When I tried to contact the company to ask about it, I quickly discovered that there was no contact information to be found. That being said, I enjoy wearing my new pendant, which has a sparkly back, and a pic of what I'm assuming is the tree of life on the front. It came attached to a bolo style cord to wear around the neck. I'm also enjoying the pretty resin pyramid, especially now that I've rigged it up with my own fiber optic light box that I use with my other crystals. Other than not finding any contact info for the company, I can't say I see anything negative at all. It was a fun, pretty gift that I greatly enjoyed receiving.",

My recollection of homemade soap's main ingredients includes strange, clear slabs of jelly-like rendered hog fat, sacks of lye (bad stuff), and charcoal, among other things likely 200, maybe 300 years old. From these bases came a line of products. Pine tar soap for work hands, lye soap bars for dishes and laundry, and various soaps and cleansers made from dilution of the lye soap. The only soaps purchased included Ivory, Murphy's oil soap, and PineSol.<br /><br />Yes, the lye soap could sting. We kids just thought the sting was what clean felt like.",

Nice mount.<br /><br />Many years ago, I seam mined for this tourmaline-related class gems in the Pala mining district of San Diego Cty, CA. My proper gem ID equipment is too deeply packed away to conclusively ID as aquamarine. But, from experience and hardness check, it's in the aquamarine class hardness.  There are named variations based on crystal structures, some rarer than aquamarine, that formed in the same ancient hot spring vent matrix where this formed that might be confusable with the aquamarine. Yes, there are aquamarine-colored emeralds, but this isn't that. The matrix cooled too quickly (geologically) to grow into a larger clear form.<br /><br />As advertised.",

I could smell something pleasant but I can't pinpoint the scent. This salts have so much oil that it's surprising it's loose. Very moisturizing. I've been having trouble with one of my forearms being super dry at the elbow. I mean, 1/3 of my forearm was a dry patch; awful. But after using this, the patch is half the size and softer. Another bath and I think it will be gone. Surprising since I have tried every lotion, butter, oil, etc. I could think of to get rid of it. Some sensitive areas are not thrilled, but it's not too bad. Also, I shaved my legs in the bath this time around. Bring more than 1 cartridge. The oils clog the blades.<br /><br />Note: the bags have sale labels for Amazon, but no other info.

My only complaint, as a non-beginner in begleri, is the weight and finish of the product. Machining lines present on the final product. Not a deal breaker but, I'd prefer a polished, smooth finish. And the weight is rather heavy, for a set of begleri. But, extra weight is great for beginners as lighter sets are a bit harder to control when you first start out. Overall, a solid 4/5. Very good value, for the price. Just a tad unpolished and heavy for my personal taste. But, a decent addition to my collection for not a lot of money.",

It's comfy, the adjustable pulls allow it to be perfect and not too tight. It's also the first ever pull tie on a bracelet that doesn't undo itself constantly, you have to pull with some strength to adjust the tightness but once adjusted it STAYS.<br />The beads feel very high quality; I have no worries about them chipping or breaking with day-to-day wear. I also love the slight sparkle they have in the sunlight or bright indoor lights!<br /><br />If you're considering getting something like this, I highly recommend this one!",

It even has some dotted patterning in it.  These  definitely are not natural range markings nor what I consider normal wear - since it hadn't even been out of the box.  I went online with these same photo/video and asked if that was typical.  The responses from people with this same one all said that the scratches on mine were extreme.  I contacted the company, sent these same photo/video and was told it was normal for this leather.<br /><br />It's a beautiful color and appears well made, although the elastic is frayed.  I will trim it and put some on Fray Check glue to stop it.<br /><br />If you buy this and it's like the one I received, I think you will be a bit shocked at the extent of the scratching. Be prepared to buy a leather conditioner and put some elbow grease into it, unless you like the look of leather being stepped on and ground into a cement floor.",

Much safer than an electric heating pad.  I can heat it to just the right temperature for me and place it under my back and it will relax the muscles so I can get to sleep.  It naturally absorbs just enough moisture from the air so that when you heat it, it's not a dry heat.  And the body heat from lying on it will absorb into it through the night keeping it warm & enabling it to maintain some of the heating properties.<br /><br />Be very careful about how much you heat it, especially if you are going to be leaning or lying on it.  It will feel hotter on your back (or anywhere else) than on your hands.<br /><br />I'm going to order the next size up (XL) for fuller back coverage.  I'll get unscented this time.

I wanted something of quality but so it needed to be sturdy, not super distracting, and not super expensive.  This is it!!!  I put in a custom order since I got a bigger bullet journal and was unsure which size to get.  I messaged Trina and she responded back to me within a day, telling me she would customize my order without an extra cost.  Today the cover came in the mail and I am SO EXCITED.  It fit beautifully onto my journal, looking smaller than the journal but then stretching to be sturdy and well fitted.  The journal does not pull open but lays closed as I want it to.  The journal I bought has 2 book marks but the cover itself also has two bookmarks, which I love, so I can mark various pages that I reference at frequently.  The back closing strap on the journal is covered now but that is not a huge deal to me as I have a strap for a travelers journals that is separate and can keep it shut in my bag.  If you are going back and forth on ordering, don't.  Just order it.  You won't regret it.  Or if you are unsure which size to get, email Trina and she is super helpful.  I will definitely be ordering from her again.  This is definitely a quality product!",

I did have to tap a little glitter off the back but it settled in the bottom of the bag so all was good.<br />I paid for the rushed shipping and it got here (WI) under a week. Very impressed with this company. Came with a hand written thank you note as well. Nice touch!! Really pleased with this purchase and would definitely order from them again.",

I have always been partial to the look of obsidian, hematite and tiger's eye, so having the 3 of them together made for a really nice look. It is very nicely made too, and sturdy. It tightens by pulling the small hematite balls on the ends of the cords. You just have to watch as you are doing it, since they don't tighten evenly. My biggest complaint is also the balls. Once tightened, they just hang there, which isn't a big problem if they are facing down, it does get very annoying when your wrist is turned, since they bounce back and forth across your arm. It isn't that big of annoyance to get me to stop wearing it though.",

They also seem to be shrinking pretty quickly. No smell like the wool ones!<br />Update! These last quite a bit longer than I expected and no more dark hairs in the laundry. Added a star for the improved experience.",

    "text": "There is a slight odor to the bag, but there was an enclosed note that mentioned the odor & stiffness would go away with time & use. It seems to be a well made bag. I was afraid the interior zipper was broken, but it fixed itself when zipped, but will keep an eye on that. The color of the leather is beautiful. It has a flap with 2 magnetic snaps for closure. It is a little stiff, but most leather softens with use, so not a concern. It has an exterior zip pocket that holds my smartphone without having to finagle to fit. It has a good amount of pockets too. It is the perfect size for a crossbody bag, not to big or small. The one thing I would note is, in order to wear at my hip as I prefer, I had to put the strap on the last hole.  I am only 5'4”, so it may me too short for taller women to wear at their hip. For me it fit perfect to where I want to be. It is a nice bag, that seems to be good quality leather, so with proper care should have a long life.",

Within a short time I developed a rash around my neck where the necklace chain laid. So I gave it a gentle scrub under some water with a washcloth thinking maybe it had a chemical coating that needed to be washed off. Unfortunately that didn't work as my neck broke out again and this time the necklace started turning green after 2 days of use. So I'm planning to buy a new chain from the jeweler and transfer the charms. It really is the most beautiful piece of jewelry I've seen yet so really hoping to be able to continue wearing it.",

I choose the leather colored bookmark, in the day light and bright light, named etched in is visible and stands out. Obviously darker area with very little light the name doesn't stand out as much due the leather/black blending in. That is expected due the leather color being standard brown with black letters.

It produces just the right amount of foam as the tub fills and the citrus smell is present but not overpowering.  I guess because this product can also be used as a body wash, the manufacturer didn't want you to smell too much like a lemon :-)<br />Anyway, looking at the ingredients, they're mostly natural, so that's good.  I always rinse after a bath, so that isn't too much of a concern for me, but it might be for others.

    "text": "I have had this for about a month now and I can say that it is a high quality product. The cane has a nice heft- very solid. The head is carved from two solid pieces of hardwood laminated together to create a symmetrical wood grain (you can easily see this in the pattern on the back of the skull in my photos). When it comes to individually hand-made items, there is always a fear that what you get may differ significantly from the listing's images. In this case, however, the skull is carved just as shown in the item description. One of the things that made me decide on this cane was the simple, realistic skull; it's not overly stylized as I often see on products like this; i.e., it is not made to look \"evil\" or \"angry\" or have fangs or anything silly like that. It's just a pure, fairly realistic representation of a skull, which makes it classy enough for formal use, but stylish and well-made even for everyday use. The head can be screwed off and replaced if desired. Mine came with a spare rubber end cap, black rubber, small enough to keep the elegant, classy look, but large enough to feel sturdy and grip well. The cane feels very good in my hand; the curve of the skull is easy to grip. I bought this for everyday use due to a disability, and whatever the situation it gets loads of compliments. I am 100% happy that I made this purchase.",

I have to use both hands and push down while something else is pressing up into the cardboard to push the deodorant up. And when I put the cardboard cap on it is fraying all the edges of the cardboard around the top and digging into the deodorant. What I've been doing is just setting the cap loosely on top.

They don't pinch a bit and you really can't tell they're clip-ons unless you're actually looking for it.<br /><br />They ARE a bit difficult to put on. I have to use both hands at a weird angle, and start clear up at the top of my ear where the cartilage is thin, then slide them down to my lobes. I've only worn them twice, but they don't seem to be bent or stretched. I'm super careful though, since they do seem like they could snap. I was also afraid they might easily fall off, and they DO pull off quite easily, but only when it's intentional. They withstood normal wear, hugs, and changing clothes without coming off. Not sure I'd want to test the limits, but for easy-going activity, they fit the bill.<br /><br />I hope they last because they're exactly what I was looking for. I just wish there was a wider variety of colors to choose from!",

    "text": "I am a woman and, out of all IA sample scents I tried before, Saint Julep was the only one I loved. I ordered the 1.7 oz spray for my birthday. For me, it was a wonderful summer fragrance choice — the scent is evocative of wood, fresh sweaty skin, summer heat, hay, tangerine rind and, of course, mint. I loved the description of it. Saint Julep is not sweet and not your typical aftershave-like “unisex” option, either. I think it is truly a scent that could be used by anyone who is not into florals/gourmands. IA creator(s) tend to add something “burnt” to their compositions (“Mom, I smell like a pirate!”, said my daughter when she tried one of the samples), which I don't like necessarily, but here the accent is softer and doesn't bother me. It is more peppery than smoky. So, overall, it is a very special scent that transports you straight into a hot summer day when you close your eyes. The mint is at the heart of this composition and gives it a uniquely relaxed Southern character.<br />That said, the sillage is almost non-existent, and it is a huge flaw. For this price, it is rather disappointing. I would give this fragrance 5 stars if it had more staying power, but there is barely any.<br />Overall: thoroughly enjoy the scent when I put it on, literally. I don't really smell anything in 20 minutes.",

Galen should consider making that an optional feature for those of us who like to use it as a compact Kaweco/pocket pen case (Wancai, Conklin minigraph, Passaporto etc. would all fit too, though less of them with the wider profile. That's why one strap across would be excellent.) It's lovely. You won't regret buying this!",

    "text": "I ordered this for my partner who was looking for new house numbers for his remodeled home. They were intended as a Christmas gift but the manufacturer had let me know far in advance to not expect them before December 28th. Too my great surprise my mailman brought them on December 24th and announcing I had a friend in Cyprus!! (The house numbers are manufactured in Cyprus of all places... imagine.. something not manufactured in China) They were very well packaged in a nice cardboard carton with tabbed slots instead of wads of plastic tape and well cushioned in bubble wrap. They arrived in excellent condition and were very well received on Christmas. The product is first rate, well manufactured and has a distinctive Modernist design. Clean design and easily read from 50 feet.",

This is the cutest thing!!!<br /><br />The urchin shell was perfect with zero damage.  The seller really went above and beyond to ensure its safe arrival, I appreciate that!<br /><br />It's an actual urchin shell.
