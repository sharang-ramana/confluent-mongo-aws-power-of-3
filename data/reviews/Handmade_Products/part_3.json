It's bold and unique, however, unlike my other prints which were well-packaged with stiff cardboard or in a stiff envelope, this was paired with a flimsy piece of cardboard and put into a soft, padded envelope.<br /><br />The result was two creases in the lower left-hand corner of my print. The top one was mostly diminished by laying something flat and heavy on top of it. The one closer to the corner is more noticeably creased, but it's small enough that when I mat and frame it, it shouldn't be a problem.

Of course, the movement is the same for each. I honestly wondered before ordering if I would like the half version of the Daydream, but I have every other Mobii style and size, and I've never been disappointed. I certainly wasn't in this case either. You have lots of movement with these half versions. You can flip rings over and over or place the Mobii on a finger and roll the rings over each other. If you prefer a little more movement with your fidget, you may like these even better than the full Mobii. I will say that these half version Mobii do make a bit more noise when just flipping rings in your hand, but as I've said before in reviews, they are aluminum rings. Of course they are going to make some noise when they strike each other. It's not loud, as you might expect with a heavier metal. It's also not a big deal to me. Just know that it won't be silent. Although, when placed over a finger and rolled, there is very little noise. If you're wondering if you'll like this fidget, I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.

It has wonderfully simple and smooth unending movement. The weight is just right. It does make more noise than the tighter fitting Möbii fidgets—I mean, they're stainless steel rings. The noise doesn't bother me, and it's basically as loud as you make it.<br />The Small Möbii fidgets are really nice for discreet fidgeting at meetings, etc., and they work well for just fingertip fidgeting. The colors are vibrant, and the customization option is a lot of fun!<br />The Small Stainless Steel and Copper Möbii is really nice—another favorite!  The weight is great, and the movement is very smooth. I really like the copper mixed with the stainless steel.<br />The Medium Möbii fidgets probably get the most use (yes, another favorite) because of the perfect size, nice movement, and fun colors. They are lightweight and quiet (not silent).  I do also have a Medium Stainless Steel Möbii, which, of course, has a little more weight to it and a good feel. The Stainless Steel version probably has slightly better overall movement. Although, I do still tend to pick up the brightly colored Aluminum version more often.<br />The Spin Rings (Anodized Aluminum and Stainless Steel) are both wonderful, whether you wear them at the base of the finger or in the middle—depending on fidget preferences. Of course, the Stainless Steel version is heavier. I really like both. I like more rings per spin ring for fidgeting and spinning, but obviously, more rings make the entire ring much thicker.  If I wear a thick ring on my right (dominant) hand, it tends to interfere with writing. I usually just switch hands or set it aside.<br />Everything I've received has been very well made and delivered in a cute little Möbii-branded bag. As other reviewers have stated, the personal, hand-written “thank you” note is a nice touch. I had a few large orders, and the seller even included a free Small Möbii in two of the shipments!!  I was super excited!  (Geoff, I hope you're reading this:  Thank you so much!!!)<br />These make great gifts and have been a hit with my family and friends. I am addicted!  I highly recommend any of these Steel Lynx products, y'all!! You can't go wrong!",

    "text": "To begin, I have purchased each of the following (many in multiples):<br /><br />Möbii Daydream, Deep Thought, Half Thought, Medium Möbii, Medium Stainless Steel Möbii, Small Möbii, Small Stainless Steel and Copper Möbii, Anodized Aluminum Spin Ring, Stainless Steel Spin Ring.<br />(All except the Small Stainless Steel/Copper Möbii and the Medium Stainless Steel Möbii are pictured above basically in the order they are listed.  The two not pictured are the same size as the other Small and Medium Möbii and are well represented with the seller's pictures.  And, please ignore the busted knuckle from yard work. :) )<br /><br />If you are like me, and like to comparison shop using reviews, I hope the inclusion of each item is helpful. That said, for simplicity, I will be copying and pasting the same review on each of the items I have purchased.<br /><br />While the Daydream is a bit large for my hand, it works because it is so lightweight. The individual links/rings are thicker than the Medium and Small Möbii, and I like the feel and movement.<br />The Deep Thought is nice and heavy with a good feel to it. I purchased it as a gift to my husband. It fits well in his large hands, and he seems to like it.<br />The Half Thought is wonderful!  It is definitely one of my favorites. It has wonderfully simple and smooth unending movement. The weight is just right. It does make more noise than the tighter fitting Möbii fidgets—I mean, they're stainless steel rings. The noise doesn't bother me, and it's basically as loud as you make it.<br />The Small Möbii fidgets are really nice for discreet fidgeting at meetings, etc., and they work well for just fingertip fidgeting. The colors are vibrant, and the customization option is a lot of fun!<br />The Small Stainless Steel and Copper Möbii is really nice—another favorite!  The weight is great, and the movement is very smooth. I really like the copper mixed with the stainless steel.<br />The Medium Möbii fidgets probably get the most use (yes, another favorite) because of the perfect size, nice movement, and fun colors. They are lightweight and quiet (not silent).  I do also have a Medium Stainless Steel Möbii, which, of course, has a little more weight to it and a good feel. The Stainless Steel version probably has slightly better overall movement. Although, I do still tend to pick up the brightly colored Aluminum version more often.<br />The Spin Rings (Anodized Aluminum and Stainless Steel) are both wonderful, whether you wear them at the base of the finger or in the middle—depending on fidget preferences. Of course, the Stainless Steel version is heavier. I really like both. I like more rings per spin ring for fidgeting and spinning, but obviously, more rings make the entire ring much thicker.  If I wear a thick ring on my right (dominant) hand, it tends to interfere with writing. I usually just switch hands or set it aside.<br />Everything I've received has been very well made and delivered in a cute little Möbii-branded bag. As other reviewers have stated, the personal, hand-written “thank you” note is a nice touch. I had a few large orders, and the seller even included a free Small Möbii in two of the shipments!!  I was super excited!  (Geoff, I hope you're reading this:  Thank you so much!!!)<br />These make great gifts and have been a hit with my family and friends. I am addicted!

The ones with designs are examples of what you can do with them.<br /><br />These tumblers come with lids… Straws… And fortunately straw brushes. There is one straw brush for each tumbler, which is really great, so if you are giving them as a gift or selling them you can include the straw brush, which is required to clean these brushes properly.<br /><br />Because these tumblers are curved at the bottom; they may not be the easiest to work with if you are going to cover the entire tumbler in a pattern. You may have to use some creativity to get it just right.<br /><br />These tumblers are made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. At the current price of fifty bucks that makes them just over six bucks each. This is certainly twice the price they should be, but overall I like them.",

    "text": "I made the above pictured necklace for myself, and I love it. The orange color beads are actually shells, and I combined it with purple hair-pipe bone tube beads for a native style of necklace. I wear it frequently and get many compliments. I also make men and women's jewelry for sale in my Etsy shop \"JewelryTaylorMade\". And I sell beads in my Etsy shop \"TheRedBeadBarn\". So check me out when you've got a few minutes to visit Etsy. I'm very pleased with these buffalo gemstone pendants and all of this sellers products that I've purchased!",

The worst spot(s) I have for some odd reason are the big knuckles just below my middle fingers.  They are the biggest knuckles on my hands and I have these extreme dry spots about the size of half a dime right next to each knuckle.  Don't ask me why there...maybe because I move my hands a great deal, wash dishes by hand, and many other things...but explaining that, I have been using this body butter on my hands about three times a day (and after I wash my hands as well).  I love the smell of this thick cream even though I usually prefer a very light fragrance or none at all, but this cream is working so well and the fragrance is so nice, I'm just very pleased with it.  The spots on my knuckles have become much softer and no longer feels...I dunno, like cardboard, maybe.  I've used a pedi-file to remove dry skin on my feet and smoothed this cream over my feet as well.  Oh, and my upper arms for some reason have really patchy, dry skin and this cream is making a big difference.  The price is excellent and I will definitely purchase it again.",

However, to my surprise it was delivered yesterday @ 10:30am and I got to watch her open it and melt over it. I would like to thank the person who went out of their way to make sure it was delivered on the day of our anniversary. It meant a lot. I didn't pay for express shipping or anything.<br /><br />The product itself:<br />It is exactly as described. The quality of the frame in came in is perfect, there are no misspelled names, date or anything of the sort.

Of course, my teenager was upset because it was a gift, at least nothing happened to the necklace.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The Temoto Triple Protection Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet made a great Valentine's Day gift for my teenage rockhound. The real gemstones are very heavy, but the two rows of beads on this handmade bracelet are woven together in a crisscross pattern with rat tail cording; giving the bracelet strength and stability. The macrame slide knot has a beautiful, stainless steel tree of life bead in the center giving the bracelet a unique look.<br />The necklace with its large Dream Amethyst focal bead was a nice addition to this gift, this was a lovely and unique gift that my teenager was ready to this gift off show off to their other rockhound and gem-collecting friends.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: You will not find such a beautiful handmade bracelet for $20.99, Temoto's handwork on this Amethyst, Obsidian, and Hematite Bracelet is worth much more. For real semi-precious gems, this bracelet is a beautiful bargain and highly giftable.",

    "text": "I love Bare Beauty Naturals Biblical Purification Soap with Hyssop in Travel size 4-4.9oz, it has been a godsend; my skin is so dry and sensitive due to cancer treatment and the natural soap I used before cancer stared to irritate my skin. When I came across Bare Beauty Naturals I was excited not only because this soap has only five all plant-based ingredients: Soy, Frankincense, Myrrh, Hyssop & Cassia (cinnamon,) with a light natural fragrance, but Bare Beauty Naturals is a Black-Owned Business; as a woman of color I'm so glad when I can purchase from a company that understands my hair and skin.  Biblical Purification soap, is hand cut, so the weight varies from bar to bar, it does an excellent job of cleansing my skin; I feel so clean when I step out of the shower, and the scent is relaxing and rejuvenating.<br />Pharmacist, Dr. Anthony Blash (yes, he is a real person, you can find him on LinkedIn,) is the founder of Bare Beauty Naturals, and he created the natural product recipe for this soap and all of Bare Beauty Naturals products and now that I've had a chance to use this soap I want to try their other products.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: I highly recommend, Bare Beauty Naturals Biblical Purification Soap. It is a 100% natural handmade soap with minimal ingredients, and even though it is $17.05 for a small bar, it has lasted over a month, with at least another month, or more left to the bar. For me, it has been healing and life-saving since my hands are no longer cracking and bleeding; I still have to use strong moisturizer and sunscreen to protect my skin, but the sensitivity and dryness are much less. Additionally, my radiation and mastectomy scars feel less irritated under my clothes at the end of the day.",

    "text": "J&L Naturals Sustainable Lip Balm is a truly sustainable product; from the stickers to the packaging, every piece is recyclable or biodegradable. The lip balms arrive in a cardboard box sealed with a low-adhesive sticker. Opening the package presents you with another sticker on the lid letting you know that your purchase planted a tree through #TEAMTREES; a QR code and web address provide you with a link to more info. The box is filled with Kraft paper crinkles to protect the lip balms in transit. The Lemongrass and Clove scent/ flavor was a pleasant surprise and a change from the usual flavors/ scents.<br />The tubes of lip balm are where sustainability genuinely shines; the cardboard tubes push up rather than twist, and the balm itself is wider for better coverage. This formula is created from six safe, simple vegan ingredients: Organic Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Shea Butter, Candelilla Wax, Lemongrass Essential Oil, and Clove Essential Oil. There are six scents available, and one of them is unscented if you have sensitivity.<br />The Bottom Line: At $27.49, each J&L Naturals sustainable tube is ~$5.50 each and holds more than twice as much as a standard plastic tube, which is excellent news for your bottom line. The vegan plant-based ingredients and plastic-free packaging are a boon for the planet. J&L Naturals Sustainable Lip Balm is a win-win product all around and would make a great stocking stuffer.",

Not only is the design delightful, the paper on which it is printed is gorgeous quality. The service provided by the artist is both charming and superior. The print arrived gift-wrapped, included a gorgeous football-themed blank card, and was extremely well protected from the travails of overseas shipping. The cherry on top of the LFC-themed sundae was the hand-written thank you note from the artist. Wow.<br /><br />I promise any of the Typography prints you choose for yourself or your gift recipient will be a highlight of your celebration. I am beyond impressed by this clever print and the seller's service.",

    "title": "Birds can feed in it also, not so good",
    "text": "I live in Maine and maybe our squirrels and birds are larger.  The feeder itself is awesome and the owner put his heart and soul into it, it is so obvious.  It is the Best Feeder Hands down.  The problem comes in with the holes on both sides.  The holes are not big enough.  I suppose it would be for the red smaller squirrels, but not the gray ones here in Maine.  All the animals share the feeders at my place, it is a matter of who gets their first and their size.  So the smaller ones feed later in the afternoon, after the larger ones have their fill in the morning and there is no stopping the Blue Jays from getting the peanuts.  They love them.  I have tried hiding the peanuts under seed and the Jays find them and take one, and two if they really try hard.  I love all the animals outside no matter, skunks can find their own food.  It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't get spooked and leave a stench.  Anyway this is about the Birds.  I noticed someone said that even the birds eat out of this feeder.  They sure do and one Freezing morning, I checked out the door and said Gee there is plenty of food.  It was dark in the feeder, I thought it was food.  That afternoon, I checked again and I saw something struggling in the jar.  I thought is that a squirrel?  I went to look closer and it was a Mourning Dove that had gone into feeder jar and then couldn't get back out.  Her body was too long.  I felt horrified.  I tried to calm her down.  I talked gently to her in the jar and tried to angle the jar and her body weight and length to better allow her to stick her head out and then understand that she needed to move her whole body in that direction to get out.  She maneuvered to do that fluttering frantically to somehow get the process done and over with.  I wondered if she was alright or would have a heart attack before getting out, but she managed to do what I had hoped she would and that was to point toward the glass opening and see that was how to get free.  When out, I was going to check her all over to see if she had broken a wing or anything, but she flew off so I knew she was fine.  She flew to her usual tree for the rest of the night to rest.  The next morning I saw her with a bunch of her friends by the feeder all eating happily.  I had taken the glass jar off the feeder and decided the feeder would be hers and leave the glass off.  The food would stay dry and not frozen like in a planter I have one of the feeding troths for the squirrels.  She was fine and she was grateful too.  She left me a pine cone.  I knew she realized I wasn't hurting her but trying to help her and I realized too that she understood that the feeder was now hers and all of her friends with special food just for those types of birds.  They really don't eat sunflower seeds.  Anyway, it turned out well.  It was quite a scare though.  I could now feel better about the feeder and still use it for her and her friends.  So I'm happy with the feeder and I have an extra jar for the squirrels, but the feeder need much larger holes on the sides and the height of the wooden portion should be taller to accommodate squirrels sitting up in the feeder which is especially helpful during inclement weather.  It helps them stay warm instead of being cold after being wet.  I worried about that too.  So it is an excellent quality feeder, best wood and awesome job, but needs to be proportioned a little differently to accomodate all sizes of animals.  I only took one star off because of the scare both her and i got and if no one had of rescued her, she would have died for sure.  The feeder is Awesome and I didn't loose out any of the use of the feeder or jar.  But the scare was a knock of one star.  I do appreciate the feeder a lot, so I wonder if the squirrels and birds are bigger at my place.  They could very well be because of the environment.  There is plenty of food except during winter and they really should be hibernating at this time, but some don't fully and do get up and about, but they are usually not fully awake, something just stumbled them out of their sleep.  So take these things into consideration so as not to be disappointed.  The size could be related to the area.  Hope this was helpful.",

    "text": "I have many of this seller's rings and they are done in perfection.  I never find one that is haphazard or crooked in the mount.  The stone is always perfect and not scratched.  I hesitated to get this one due to it being lab created, but lab created can often turn out to be stronger than the original stone, and is often much cheaper in price.  No one would ever know and yet it is awesome and will go with lots of things that I have in my wardrobe and accessories in blue or sapphire.  I always appreciate the attention to detail when it comes to the band.  I'm a real picky person and this seller never disappoints.  The fit was really great and I was even included a free ring sizer.  I had no idea what it was at first, but realized after looking it over.  I use a different kind that is more like a stick with numbers.  It has the ability to read as low as a 1/2 size which is a baby ring.  Baby rings are really tiny, but they do grow into them.  When little and during the early 1900s, babies often wore a string around the ring attached to them.  There were actually more babies wearing them in that era.  It is sort of uncommon now, but I still find many liking a Vintage Ring for their baby or as a gift.  I think of it as a special gift for baby.  So I know enough about jewelry to know what a skilled maker is and this seller has lots of simple, not gaudy rings that I really like, but I do have both personally for the special occasion and everyday worn.  I do highly recommend this seller.  Check some of her rings out.  I'm sure you will be impressed at the quality.",

Fortunately, I am pretty crafty myself, so I simply took some sterling silver wire, and fashioned a couple hooks that wrap around the back of my ears, and book in the top crease where my ears attach to my head.  I have a lot of jewelry, although mostly pearls, but these are amongst my most cherished earrings of any variety.  There is an otherworldly energy to these that can easily be quite mesmerizing.

    "text": "I received the cemetery marker for our family member today. First of all, we received it ahead of the tentative scheduled delivery date. Secondly, we are beyond impressed with the quality of it. The workmanship simply exceeded our expectations. Carved Impressions has truly created a beautiful tribute for our deceased family member. We couldn't be more happier than we are to have chosen them on this bittersweet occasion. As stated in other reviews, they sent a proof for approval and the transaction was just so smooth and peaceful. We highly recommend them. Quality workmanship, affordability, and ahead of schedule - just can't get any better.",

I really stress in my room that mistakes are going to happen, it's whether or not you take the time to correct them so this phrase was perfect.<br /><br />The packaging it came in was so perfecting wrapped, and the personalized name tag that came on it was very sweet.  The way it comes packaged, you could absolutely buy this as a gift and not need to wrap it.  Seriously, I was very impressed with how it was packaged, sooo many packages off of Amazon are bare bones with packaging.<br /><br />The paper stock it came on was very nice quality, and thick.  The printing and ink were also high quality.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it is digitally printed, and because of that I feel $17 is high.  If it was hand drawn, I believe $17 would be about right, but these are mass produced, and digitally printed.<br /><br />I was given this product for free, and was happy to write a review.",

I removed it with a very hot towel and most of the balm seemed to come off.  My face was soft and smooth afterwards, but I think that was because of the greasiness of the balm which probably needed more scrubbing to remove.  Personally, I cannot see it as a cleaning product.  Not sure what I'd call it or how I'd use it.  The price is high for the small amount.  The scent is fabulous though.  I wish I could find an essential oil or candle that smelled just like the balm.",

    "title": "Finally! Leather GRID Journals for Men! Moleskine Grid Journal Filler + This Leather Cover = INCREDIBLE! • Brown Thread Color •",
    "text": "I have searched the entire internet for a year and a half for a refillable leather journal for my husband. He's not a big journaler but he likes to 'bullet journal' which basically means he makes to-do lists with bullet points, jots his notes and ideas and keeps track of his days that way. I can look at his list and be lost. (No doodles? No cute pen colors?!!) He looks at his lists and remembers the activities of the day fondly and feels productive. But here was my dilemma: my husband prefers graph paper / grid journals to write in but he can't find one he likes. He doesn't want to haul around the bigger gridded composition books because he is a minimalist. He doesn't like the dot grid journals because he wants the grid lines. He insists the smaller grid journals with colored covers I have found are too girlie. {Rips hair out}<br /><br />I have poked around for OVER A YEAR trying to find the man an executive-looking leather journal that is refillable with grid paper but is slim and portable, not huge and bulky. It was impossible to find the journal fillers, let alone a leather cover, which would probably have to be custom made for about ninety if I ever could find grid journals he liked. I didn't mind investing in something that would last for a long time but such a thing just was not to be had. Until I found OleksynPrannyk.<br /><br />You see, Moleskine just so happens to make a gorgeous [[ASIN:8866134244 Cahier grid lined journal in their Large (5 x 8.25) size]]. This seller happens to make a Large size leather cover to fit those Cahier grid journals. I had never seen the masculine, gray covered grid journals in local stores and I hadn't noticed them before on Amazon until I came across this journal and began to look at refill page options. I couldn't believe what I had found! Could this be the perfect combination for my husband's Christmas gift?<br /><br />The truth is I fretted for three days about ordering this journal. Was the leather good quality? Yes. There were rave reviews. What color stitching should I get if I want the stitching to *perfectly* match the leather? Turns out the answer is Brown, which the seller himself helped me with. (He was awesome!) Was the quality of the stitching good? Yes. It is better than good. It is top of the line. What was I waiting for?<br /><br />I ordered the Leather cover Monday afternoon September 19th and waited. It shipped the next day. (Was this thing Prime? No. It's handmade. They just ship fast!) It arrived at my house Thursday September 22nd, practically at Prime speed. Nice!<br /><br />When I opened the shipping envelope I was blown away by the understated yet charming, old-fashioned way the leather cover was wrapped in brown paper and string. It truly looked like a gentleman's parcel. When I unwrapped the leather cover, I was awestruck. First, it smelled AMAZING - like an expensive Italian leather goods store. The quality of the leather was BEAUTIFUL! Supple in my hands with fine grain, a gorgeous saddle brown shade and a good feel. It is the kind of high quality leather that will develop a dashing patina with age that cannot be purchased or mimicked; like the Velveteen Rabbit it can only come from using a beloved item until it shows how magnificent and useful it has been in a person's life.<br /><br />The stitching and the quality of the workmanship is beyond words. The fine needle holes with the high quality thread work carefully completed by experienced hands that love leather and have been doing this work for years is unsurpassed by anything I have seen, including handmade leather items I have not been able to afford. This journal cover is luxurious and will add a touch of old-style class as it sits on my husband's office desk, assisting with daily tasks and keeping track of his notes.<br /><br />Really, I am blown away by the quality and charm of this leather journal. It is exquisite and I am thrilled for Christmas to roll around so I can watch my picky, buy-once-cry-once, minimalist hubby open his gift to reveal this journal that is as unique, reliable and handsome as he is. To all of those who are like me and were worried about investing the money in this journal, worry no longer. Place the order and get ready to meet the love of your journaling life!<br /><br />P.S. The cover ships with a nice Moleskine lined journal with a black cover already inside of it, ready for gift giving. If you do not emboss the leather cover, the cover can be completely reversible. That is, you can flip the cover over and around so the back becomes the front if you stain it or damage the front of it in any way.<br /><br />I was wildly fortunate to receive a small discount to purchase this Large size 5 x 8.25 leather journal cover so I could try it out and write a review. I still invested a significant amount of money in this journal and made a careful purchase. My husband truly is as discerning and picky as I described, which means I am even pickier when it comes to selecting gifts for him because if they are not perfect, he will not use them. This leather cover is perfection itself. I imagine it will be something I see him using daily for years and decades to come, until it is a cherished heirloom. I sincerely hope that by sharing my pictures, my feelings of fretting over the purchase and then my experience with the stunning finished product that you are able to make the absolute best buying decision for yourself or a very lucky loved one! Enjoy your exquisite new journal!",

BONUS: The gift was already nicely gift wrapped so I was able to order it and have it sent directly to her house. Her mother, my grandmother, use to sing a song \"A bushel & a peck\" and Added words of love to the end of  it to the tune. We miss her so much. What a perfect sweet reminder of Grannie. Since this was the first necklace I ordered I didn't know what to expect! My Aunt sent a photo of the gift wrapped box and said she couldn't wait until Christmas to open it but promised to wait. She sent a photo of her wearing the necklace with two other necklaces on Christmas Day and it looked fabulous. I couldn't believe it! I was surprised how amazing it looked & that she wore it Christmas Day to a restaurant with her friends! I have added the two photos she sent me. She loved it! After seeing hers. I started looking at other necklaces for sell by this same company & found the perfect one for me! So I ordered myself an \"After Christmas\" present. I must say mine is very meaningful & perfect for myself. I mentioned it in the review of the one I ordered for myself about being a \"strong women\" that these are adjustable necklaces. I bought her the 24\" which is perfect for her but I ordered the much longer one for me hoping it might be adjustable and it is!",

I bought the longest necklace! When I first saw this necklace online I actually CRIED for the following reasons. The butterfly is a symbol of thyroid awareness! I just went through parathyroid surgery and haven't felt the positive effects in my body yet. I was told to just give it more time.  I had the option of the blue stone which happens to be my daughters birthstone. I felt it represents that I am a mother. How ironic is that? After reading the necklace & quote on the necklace & the included card. I felt validated as I have been going through so much more that the thyroid issue. The quote reminded me how far I have come & worked so hard to get there. It reminds me it takes a strong women to continue to work hard to get through things I can't control and the things I can. My future looks bright because I am a fighter. I enjoyed receiving the necklace & card reminder gift boxed. An after Christmas gift for myself! It's just a blessing to own something so meaningful and with a pretty vintage look. I just wanna say thank you so much for this precious gift.",

It comes with the black cord and then it also comes with a nice silver chain as well as the key chain. I have attached it to my purse and it's so darn cute. It's really well made and such a clever design. I highly recommend this darling little robot charm.",

I think it is an interesting concept to wear a piece of glass that is 2000 years old...should be a conversation piece.<br />If you buy this it will take several weeks for delivery,  If I remember correctly, about six or seven weeks.<br />I would have rated five stars, but the glass is not as pretty as another I have.  It varies from piece to piece of course.",

I had hoped to be able to write a message on the back of the bookmarks, but I was afraid that would bleed through to the front. The artist's work is very nice.
