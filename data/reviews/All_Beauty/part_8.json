So I ordered it, thinking that I already know what the color is like so I didn't need to worry about seeing it in person first before buying it. So when the compact arrived, I was surprised to find that the color had changed a bit. Instead of being a neutral/natural pink, it definitely has become a light, cool-tone pink. Now, this really isn't a problem because it's just the right shade and tone that will work very well on my cool-toned complexion, but it ISN'T the B-Slap blush I remember from 6 or 8 years ago. And I feel a little disappointed. I really liked how that almost-but-not-quite warm/neutral pink looked on my complexion. I will still wear it; it's a lovely pink, but it isn't &#34;the old&#34; B-Slap that I remember. Warm-toned girls who used to like the original blush color will have to look elsewhere for this color because this incarnation will look a little too blue-pink on you.",

Last year I gave her an expensive contour kit , which she uses daily, so she tried this flat contour brush with that palette. She said it works great for contouring cheeks, forehead and neck area and the brush holds the product well. After feeling the brush for myself- it is extremely soft and filled with short bristles- and seeing the results on her skin I ordered 3 more. One for my daughter in law, myself and an extra in case I need to give a gift!<br />While looking on Amazon and comparing products, prices and reviews, I noticed many of the same brushes, this one, with different prices- some were 5.99, some were 1.99 + 3.98 shipping... so be aware for higher prices for same product.",

    "text": "I've tried a couple of different types of epilators over the past 15-20 years.  While I was usually happy enough with the results, I rarely used them since it always seemed like you had to wait until the hair got long enough for the unit to grip the hair in order to yank it out.  And rarely did I really want the hair on my legs to reach that amount of stubble.  Not to mention the pain that is involved with epilators.  Yes, I am a weenie.<br /><br />This model of the Braun Silk Epil removes much shorter hair.  It claims to remove hair that is as short as a grain of sand (0.5mm).  I personally find it requires it to be a bit longer than that to grip; but it does do a much better job of reaching short hair than others I've tried.  It has a pivoting head which lets it work around all your body contours.  A light on the unit allows even the palest, finest hairs to be visible.<br /><br />In addition to hair removal, this epilator refines your skin.  A sonic massage system and high-density brush scrub away old skin cells.  This exfoliation helps to stimulate the regeneration of surface skin cells in order to create a smoother skin tone.  I do notice a bit of a smoother, more even skin tone on my legs now.  This sonic massage is my favorite part of the device...in part because I really don't like the tweezing part.<br /><br />This model can be used wet or dry and uses rechargeable batteries rather than a power cord.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I find that it still hurts...although not nearly as much as it used to.  With regular use, the hairs on my legs have become fewer.  Plus, the already pale fine hair is becoming even thinner and weaker.  Braun claims that it will keep your body free of hair for up to 4 weeks.  I usually find it to be somewhere in the 2 to 3 week range for me.  Still, that's nice for when you're going on vacation or heading off to the beach for a week or two.  I allow the growth to get to the slight stubbly stage and then I'm perfectly smooth for a couple of weeks.",

The sponge applicator comes to a small point and I was surprised to be able to do a pseudo wing shape at the outer corner. You do need to use a blending brush to work the fade and I also do a transition color using another brush. I do find it quicker than using  brushes and powder alone, but since you have to re-dip for more powder even when it's brand new, I'm wondering how much effort it's gonna be once the product starts to get used up. You will probably have to not only twist the sponge applicator all the way back into the cap to pick up more, but also tap it to release more powder onto the appllicator. That would be annoying.<br />The color is pretty - a lighter, brighter purple than I expected. Overall, I'd say it's ok. Not great, not awful.

I don't mind the whiteness, as this is a mineral sunscreen and its normal, but it didn't work. I apply sunscreen every 50 minutes to an hour. I was so burnt by the end of the day. Thankfully I had one more application of my older sunscreen, so I used that the next day along with my guard shirt and towel for my legs. I had to run out and buy more, but I got Ology and Badger arrives tomorrow. Hopefully those work. My old sunscreen has vitamin A in it so that is why I stopped using it.",

Luckily for me, they came off easily. If you have any issues, use a bit of water. I did wash the pieces before using because they had a bjt of a smell (plastic?).<br /><br />I washesban assortment of brushes. I put them all face up while I was cleaning and when I finished, I picked up the top piece and flipped it so the brushes were upside down.<br /><br />The brushes took a bit of time to dry (12+) but the long time could be because of where I live and the lack of heat/light.<br /><br />Overall, I like this product a lot and will be using it every time I clean my brushes. My biggest problem with the rack is the size of the brush holes. I have some thin brushes that could use smaller holes. Also my oval brushes had some issues in here.<br /><br />My favorite thing is that it's easily to transport or put away. This can be assembled/disassembled in 30 seconds. It also doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart any second when it's filled with your brushes on the table.",

The consistency was not too thick and if you rubbed a bit between your fingers, you could still see it, but it was not gummy. I used a bath puff and it did not lather up as foamy as I like. Will try a bath sponge. It does have a very light scent, which is what you expect from a natural product. After rinsing of the body wash, I noticed that my skin was very soft and smooth. They seem to use a very good quality moisturizer in the product that does not  completely disappear after rinsing. The product is not heavy, chemical laden and seems like the perfect body wash for sensitive skin. Only drawback is the cost. 15.99 for 8oz is not a good value.",

That is a lot of heat for hair to withstand.  This blow dry spray protects my hair from all that heat.<br /><br />My process is as follows:<br />I wash and gently towel dry my hair, then spray this on my damp hair.<br />I then blow dry my hair, straightening it as I dry.<br />Then I &#34;lightly&#34; spray this on my hair prior to using my flat iron.<br />I have then protected my hair before the heat of the dryer, and then again before the heat of the flat iron.<br /><br />Argan oil is wonderful helps me prevent the frizzies that accompany curly hair.  It gives it a healthy, smooth shine that I haven't had since my teenage years.<br /><br />The pump itself is very easy to use.  Traveling quite a bit, it is nice that there is a &#34;safety&#34; switch that you change push to keep it from spraying in your suitcase.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my unbiased review.",

I struggled through many different pairs and brands of contacts and they all just never felt right.  My eyes just felt gritty and dry.  My doctor finally just made this comment, and it is very true:  At a certain age women just have less moisture in their bodies (in this case it was my eyes).<br /><br />That phrase also applies to our skin, and of course the most visible is our face.  This moisturizer is for those of us that need that extra little boost, as we might have &#34;advanced&#34; skin.  Now in my late 40's I am noticing those fine lines, especially on my forehead, what I would call my furrowed brow lines.  Will this moisturizer erase these lines? No.  But it can help diminish appearance.<br /><br />An added benefit of this moisturizer is it also provides a moisture barrier to protect your skin from the elements.  As a child of the 80's, we all grew up loving the sun and getting tan.  Now we know better and with better products are able to protect our skin from the elements.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKG14OEE86CQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0SE52Q",

I purchased the black, which is a very rich, soft black color.  I received a discount for my honest review.  This mascara is comparably to Estee Lauder's brand.  It is smudge proof, which I really like.  It is certified organic and made in the USA",

I even turned the water all the way up and it did not blow the nozzle off as predicted. Since I have been getting rave reviews at the dentist I think I'll just stick with the regular nozzle, so much easier than having to switch, refill, switch back for the next time. Actually I can keep them for replacements if/when my regular ones wear out, if they ever do.",

I think it will bounce even more after a little length is off. Oh, another thing I noticed is that it doesn't smell bad or fake or cheap. So, no need to wash it out right away. The shine is right on, so no need for powder or dry shampoo. This is pretty much a cut the lace and go wig and for me, that's a really good thing!",

I cut the lace, used a wig band and it's not even glued down. Still love it, maybe even more now!*<br /><br />To say I'm pleased would be an understatement. I've been looking for a wig that matches my hair color!! My biggest complaint is that I have a round face so I NEED bangs or fringe or something. A hairline on a non-lacefront makes me look even ROUNDER and that's not the look I'm going for! Most wigs require a lot of trimming and shaping to give me the look I want.<br /><br />I love long hair but not every day. So ... i thought I'd try this baby. Not only is the hairline beautiful but the color is perfect, the weight is amazing and the length is just right ... not too long like many are. I'll cut the lacefront eventually but these pictures are literally how it looks just plopped on my head, with my own hair peeking out. If anything, I might try to give it more volume because i love big hair but ... a few bobby pins, a wide-tooth comb and I'm SET.<br /><br />This wig is beautiful. I've included a picture of my real hair for reference. I've never given a wig such a glowing review but this is literally plug and play and, for me, that makes all the difference!",

Y'all, I tossed my BR trio palette away and just use this now and have gotten compliments. I'd like to think my change in makeup application has helped, but also the bronzer gives a more natural glow where the contour (or at least the way I was applying it) came off more harsh.

I heard it didn't really have much of a scent (I love my scented soaps) and that it was hard to lather.  As far as the scent goes, it didn't matter near as much as I thought it would. Honestly, with most soaps the scent fades rather quickly anyway. And it does have a scent. Just not a perfume scent. It's very pleasant. And it was super easy to lather. I had absolutely no issues. Truth be told, it lathered better than almost any soap I've used.  What it's not is “foamy”, and that's actually a good thing. As insane as this may sound, on the face it feels like wool. It has a close, cushioned feel to it. Some soaps I've used either dry out on the face before I finish a pass or it slides off my face. Not this.

I do not use traditional soap, however, and instead use handmaid castile soap. So, instead I just lather up first, and then use this cloth, and it's not a huge deal.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and this cloth can be too abrasive if used with any pressure on some parts of my skin. So, lathering up and then using the cloth also helps me to only use this abrasive cloth where I need it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great for those little bumps.<br /><br />Fantastic at exfoliation for shaving, waxing, any hair removal, etc.<br /><br />Helps with ingrown hairs! But be careful not to press too hard when using it. Go over multiple times at a lighter pressure rather than pressing too hard, which can have the opposite effect and actually cause ingrown hairs.<br /><br />WONDERFUL at keeping my feet smooth!

It's gentle, doesn't sting my eyes, and removes all my excess makeup. But it is expensive and as I began developing my own k-beauty skin care routine, I was looking for a gentle foaming cleanser that was more affordable. This Good Morning cleanser is perfect for everyday. I currently only use it in the morning because I still have more than half a bottle of the Purity left, which I use in the PM. But once my purity runs out, I look forward to using the CosRX cleanser both AM & PM. It foams really nicely and my skin doesn't feel excessively dry or tight after usage.

I prefer to keep it folded, wet it, add some soap or shower gel, and rub/scrunch it together until a lather forms. I used it folded on my body, and then unfold it to full length to use on my back (like the picture shows). You have to keep it out of the stream of water, or else the soap will wash right out of it.<br /><br />They were definitely much more harsh than I expected - I can only use them very gently, and can't use them at all on especially thin areas of skin like my shins, the tops of my feet, or my chest. I'd absolutely never use them on my face or neck.<br /><br />After the first use, I noticed an immediate improvement to my bumpy skin. But after I began to scrub with them daily, I felt like it actually exacerbated the problem. Plus, it was just another item to keep in the bathroom and worry about washing every week. As a side note, I wish they made these in white or grey instead of the bright colors - I feel like they'd match so many more peoples' bathroom decor and I wouldn't feel as bad about leaving one lying around the bathroom.<br /><br />Now, I just use a Salux once per week as an exfoliating treatment - they're definitely too strong to be an everyday thing for me, but it does the job and helps with my bumps overall.",

I mean this is kind of a waste of money. It's really cheap material. Literally the ears are made of one thin wire that shapes it and it's covered in cheap lace.<br />I could already tell right from out of the packaging that these pair of ears were cheap looking. They did not even make any effort of cutting the lace right. One ear has more lace material than the other and it's kind of bulging out. Plus the lace is already falling apart. There were a few pieces of lace that came off already and I literally just opened the packaging like 10 minutes ago. I had to re shape the ears just to make it look decent, like an actual pair of cat ears and not mouse ears. I really don't like giving bad reviews but this product was so bad that I had no choice and I wouldn't want other people wasting their money on this cheap product.",

    "text": "Yes, these are the full size. I've purchased the pink and clear before and loved them. The pink stays on really well even though I have to wear steel toed shoes at work every day.  Other (high end) brands have failed that test often. The pink color stays solid with that test long enough that my nails start growing out and I have to change out the polish for that reason.  The purple color must have a higher pigment load because it did chip slightly where my toe rubs against the box of my steel toed shoes. But that is still way better than other polishes. It even survives my regular beach trips.<br /><br />The polish has helped with the damage to my toe nails. The cracking I was getting is less. My family has an inherited condition that over the years causes the toe nails to thicken. The older generation has thicken so much that they have to use a rotary tool to trim their nails.  I gave a bottle of the clear to one of the men with the issue and he has seen an improvement as well. I can only hope that with the continued use my nails will never reach the level that theirs have. Since I saw a huge improvement when I started using it, I think there is a good chance.<br /><br />P.S. I am a nail polish junkie. If it is available in the US, I've tried it.",

If I were selling something in them, it would be unacceptable to me.<br />UPDATE 2/18/16 These bottles are going from a 3 star to a zero rating, as far as I am concerned.

The box around it is sprinkled with instructions. English instruction at the right side and equivalent Korean at the back. There are no leaflets inside regarding the product. I guess the manufacturer believes the pieces of information provided around the box are more than enough.<br /><br />To use, I uncapped the translucent plastic hinged cap. There is a foil safety seal at the tube's mouth I need to remove. I love the smell of this. It is flowery with a hint of Philippine Jasmine (Sampaguita) and Perfume Tree (Ilang-Ilang). There is also a teeny-tiny hint of lavender and citrus. It is made in Korea so I guess they use Asian flowers. The fragrance is subtle and not overpowering. It is light and not greasy. My skin did not complain, no irritation, no tingling sensation, and it just felt relaxed. This would be good to use during summer when my face becomes oily, and breakout may occur due to clogged pores.",

This was my first time trying a roller and gua sha, and I didn't really know what to expect because I was a little skeptical that they'd work as well as everyone says. But, I was proven wrong! My favorite of the two is the gua sha - it really improved the circulation in my face (as far as I could see and feel) and I really do believe it reduced inflammation on my face. My skin is less red and less irritated. It feels really good too. As for the roller, I don't use it as often, but I do find it helpful. I use it to rub oil onto my face and the cool sensation of the quartz feels good. I've been using this with a face oil and my face has been quite hydrated, which is great for the dry winter months. Overall, I would recommend this set, especially as a first-time user. It's supposed to come with eye masks but for some reason mine didn't, so that's why I knocked off one star.",

I've now used it exclusively for over 3 years and purchase it in multi-packs for team events.<br /><br />I've spiked hair as long as 18-24 inches and, if you can find a creative way to sleep with your hair spiked so high, your style will last a few days, even if you're dancing in the wind.<br /><br />Tips for use: Brush or comb hair. Depending on the desired style, it's often helpful to part hair into segments for spikes and using coated hair ties to keep the segments apart.  Apply spray to clean, dry hair.  Spray  Got2b Glued liberally (your hair should feel wet) first to the roots in small segments and dry with a hair dryer on a cool setting to establish the &#34;base&#34; of your style. Use your hands to shape it as your dry. (For some of the longer hair, it can become a  four-hand task, so get some assistance from a friend.) Once your shape is set, spray to the tips of your hair in small segments  and dry each segment before doing the next. When you've spiked all segments, give your entire style one more heavy coating and dry with the dryer.  For liberty spikes or other styles where you want the tips to stay tidy, apply a small amount of Got2b Ultra Glued Invisible Styling Gel (smile.amazon.com/Got2b-Ultra-Invincible-Styling-6-Ounce/dp/B004FQK7DA/) to the tips only and dry once more with the dryer.<br /><br />Clean-up is also easy.

It was the third brace I ordered -- the first was not nearly strong enough, and the second sizing was off. I'm so glad I found this one: It's a superb brace -- fine, sturdy stays,plus hinges that let you adjust both flexion and extension. I initially thought that latter feature was something I wouldn't need, but it turns out to have made a huge difference during this first month of healing. (Needless to say, I could not have handled a sleeve-type brace -- the open front/wrap style was mandatory, and made my life so much easier.)  I've been wearing the brace 24/7 -- night as well as day --  for more than a month and it's been my saving grace.  Service has been superb, too: Before I ordered, I measured my thigh, knee and calf; I was on the cusp between sizes, and so ordered up. That seemed like a good idea at the time because it allowed me to wear the brace over my slacks, as well as under -- but after almost a month of continuous wear. the thigh (which was a little larger than I needed to begin with) seemed to have stretched out; I couldn't wrap the upper portion tightly enough and even with the straps cinched tightly, the brace slipped after an hour or two or wear. I wrote the seller and asked if there was a solution -- this brace was costly enough that I didn't want to have to pay out of pocket for a second one -- and they offered to send  me a smaller size. It arrived within a few days, accompanied by a label for free return of the first.  I couldn't have been more impressed or more grateful. I'd recommend this brace, and this seller, to anyone.",

The hairline was fairly natural-looking, so I didn't have to pluck hairs to improve the look. The only drawback is that the hair is very shiny, almost oily in appearance, but dry shampoo takes care of that easily. The combs and adjustable straps make the fit secure without being too tight.<br /><br />All in all, I'm quite pleased with the wig and look forward to wearing it this Halloween.",

I also like that they come in a case, it's extremely helpful so that I don't need to go and buy another case to try and fit them into. The pages though do rip a bit easily, you just have to be careful when pulling the plates out and putting them back in. I did have one plate, at first, that was actually stuck in the page. The plates themselves are on a thick plastic card and on the back of the card is the Cisi&Sisi logo in black. Well, that logo was actually stuck to the inside of the page and that's why I couldn't get the plate out. I had to carefully stick my fingers inside to separate the page from the plate. Some of the logo ink stayed on the inside of the page but it didn't happen again. Other than that I really do like these plates and plan on collecting all of their sets.",

    "text": "I do a lot of nail art that includes stamping, sponging and a bunch of other really messy designs. My problem is that when I do all of those things the polish gets all over my skin making clean up take a bit longer than I like. So I needed to find something that could help with that problem. In comes this liquid latex!<br /><br />I ordered one in the hopes that it would help with keeping the skin around my nails clean while I'm doing those messy manicures. I cleaned out an empty nail polish bottle and filled it up with this liquid latex. Then I used the brush from the nail polish bottle to apply the liquid latex to the skin around my nails. I gave it a few minutes to dry then did my manicure. Once done with the manicure I used a little nail polish remover on a brush to make sure none of the latex was attached to the polish on my nail (don't want to ruin the manicure by pulling the polish on my nail off with the latex). Then, using tweezers, I pulled the latex off of each finger. For the most part it came off easily leaving clean up much easier with less to clean.<br /><br />This was a lifesaver! I am very pleased with this liquid latex. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell, it's almost a fishy smell. It is very strong at first when applying. Once dried the smell does dissipate for the most part so it doesn't bother me that much.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the seller or this product and am under no obligation to provide a positive review nor do I receive any sort of compensation one way or the other.

Before I had gotten this case I just had been keeping my round plates in a little drawer that I made, so needless to say it wasn't at all organized and when I would close and open the drawer the plates would all shift making an even bigger mess. Now with the plates holder I can have all of them organized and easily viewable. It really does make it so much easier now. Now when I'm getting everything ready to do my nails I can pull out this plate holder and quickly flip through the pages and look to see which plate and design I want to use. So so much easier! I love that it has a zipper enclosure so keep all the plates safe from falling out.<br /><br />I do wish the slots were a tiny bit bigger so they could also fit the small square plates. Also, with my long nails it can sometimes be a little hard to pull the plates out of the slots on the pages. Those would be my only issues with it. I almost filled it up with plates I already have and I love stamping plates so chances are I will end up ordering another one when I've run out of room.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the seller or this product and am under no obligation to provide a positive review nor do I receive any sort of compensation one way or the other.

Unless the room is totally dark though, you cant see that it lights up. Which maybe some people like that.. I didnt care either way... just making readers aware.  Overall, a good diffuser, esp for the price, I gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />** One flaw is that it's very hard to get the top off. My hands are fairly small, and due to the coned shape there is no easy way to get a grip on the lid.  The first time trying my hand kept slipping off... I literally couldn't get the top off. I had to use my nails and grab the seam. Eventually I worked the lid off, but once theres water in it, i couldnt do that again because i had to lay it sideways to do this.<br /><br />Now that I've used it several time the lid comes off easier, but in my opinion, there should have been some kind of lip on the back to hold onto.<br /><br />If you have larger hands, you probably wont have a problem. My husband got the lid off with no issues.",

I will admit that I measured the wrong thing when I ordered the SnozzlePro adapter (I measured the base of the concentrator nozzle that came with the blowdryer and not the actual blowdryer nozzle - oops!) My blowdryer is actually a little wider than the measurements given for the SnozzlePro. It was so close, I was determined to make it work! I was able to do it with a little manipulation and a slender tool to give just a little extra stretch to get the SnozzlePro over the end of the blowdryer nozzle (used a tool WITHOUT any sharp edges or points, nothing that could damage the SnozzlePro or the blowdryer). **I did this at my own risk - knowing that I could possibly damage the SnozzlePro or my blowdryer!!** Very gently, I was able to get the SnozzlePro onto my blowdryer. I made sure it was evenly attached all the way around before adding the Xtava Black Orchid diffuser. I attached the diffuser to the SnozzlePro AFTER I put the SnozzlePro on the blowdryer - the opposite of what the instructions advise you to do. (also note that before attaching the SnozzlePro to the blowdryer, I put the diffuser on the SnozzlePro a couple of times to make sure it fit properly and that I would be able to attach it without needing to use the other end of the adapter to make sure it was secure).  After getting everything in place, I'm happy to say that it's very secure and there's nothing that is loose or has any wiggle room whatsoever!! I'm never removing it!! It's there until the dryer kicks the bucket or something breaks! It's working beautifully! It holds very tightly and securely, it hasn't slipped or moved at all since I attached everything!! You can see in the pics how tightly it's holding. I love drying my hair with this diffuser! My hair looks amazing and dries faster than when I used to use a round brush! No more work drying with a round brush! Just using this diffuser and moving it to different sections of my hair, it's easier than ever to dry my hair! Thank you for making this product that allows us to use this wonderful diffuser on other brands of blowdryers! I will be recommending it to everyone who has curly hair!<br /><br />Update - the adapter and diffuser has come off a couple of times and it takes a little bit of work to get it back on because my blow dryer is a tiny bit bigger than the measurements but I can get it back on. I think it came off because I accidentally held it by the adapter or grabbed it by the diffuser. Definitely only hold it by the barrel of the blow dryer (like in my 3rd pic) or the handle for the blow dryer!",

    "text": "This looks very nice when it's assembled and you use it to store your brushes. A word of caution when you assemble it, attach the rods to the bottom piece first, then when you attach the top piece, make sure that the holes line up before you attach the top screws. They don't all line up on every set of holes. I had to undo it and reattach it to get the top and bottom slots to line up correctly! Once I did, it works beautifully. It would be nice if the bottom holes were a little deeper to hold the bigger brushes better. A little tab to pull the protective plastic would be nice too, I was afraid of scratching it while I was trying to get the protective film off! Overall it's well worth the price and I'm glad I bought it. It holds my brushes and looks very nice. UPDATE: while this looks like a nice brush hokder. It's not very practical for everyday use. The slightest touch will move the brush out of its holder. The bottom holes don't hold the brushes securely. My brushes are constantly falling over and sliding into the holder.  I wouldn't buy it again, already looking for a new holder. I'll probably go with a regular style brush holder, as long as they aren't falling all over the place!",

Bipin's production criteria and list of ingredients were both in keeping with what I seek in this type of product.  I know that some people are put off by the words \"made in China\" but I've learned that does not automatically mean a poor quality product or an ineffective one.  And while this gel might not be the right one for everybody else, it is working for me and even better than the one it replaced.<br /><br />I thought it reasonably priced.  It was carefully shrink-wrapped to avoid any leakage, bottled in convenient size (box of two), and neither too runny nor too thick in consistency.  Some reviewers mention an odor or aroma of some kind but I detected no such thing.  Initially it seemed a bit wet in application but then was fully absorbed after a few seconds and left no sticky or gummy feeling whatsoever.  This is a dream come true for my skin which seems to have become drier and more sensitive with age.  I have used it frequently over several days and have passed the point where I'd encounter a bad reaction so I'm more confident now that I made the right choice.  Too soon to tell if it will have a lasting positive impact but thus far, everything is in the plus column.",

He knows all the Pokemon and I don't know how because there's over 800 in the Pokedex.

Another reviewer said these were fake Pokemon but I identified the one in their photo as Amaura.<br /><br />They are legit Pokemon in these. The first one my husband got, he didn't remember its name but he knew it was one of the newer ones. It looked like a pink blob to me. We got 2 Pikachu's in one set and were bummed because we wanted some of the less popular Pokemon. We got Raiku and Flygon too.<br /><br />I highly recommend these for the biggest Pokemon nerds you know. It's not for people who only want the originals, because you're playing the lottery with around 800 different Pokemon.<br />I hope this info helps.",

There are rat-tail, one with a metal tip, combs as well as a couple of pick type combs. Some have dual ends for different purposes. For typical home use, these should last virtually a lifetime because of how they are constructed. For salon use, they should last a very long time and is well worth the money. Just a note: some of the combs had a grease-like substance on them, which I assume was part of the manufacturing of them. I know oil is used in the production of plastic and some was likely just missed during the cleaning process or they left some on there for a reason??? Not, sure but it easily wipes off.

    "text": "Finally, after over a year of having these, I actually tried them out! I've never worn false lashes before and was hesitant to use them (obviously since I've had them a year without using them - lol!). I've seen so many false eyelashes that are so crazy over-the-top obviously fake looking. These are not that way at all. You get a generous supply of them (see photos) and they are reusable too. With the rate I'm going, mine should last forever!<br />I don't have get up close vision so it was a little bit harder for me to apply them than it would be for someone who can see better. I used a magnifying makeup mirror though and did fine. The photos of the eyelash after it was applied was my first attempt ever to do this so it's definitely not perfect but it was much easier to apply than I expected it to be. I am sure my results will improve with practice. These are secured in place with magnetic eyeliner (I guess I am pretty ignorant about these things but I had never heard of that!). The eyeliner goes on smoothly; actually better than some liquid eyeliner that I've used in the past. It's a little tricky to get them in the best spot. Like I said previously though, I think this will get much easier the more times I try them. It comes with tweezers to use but it was almost easier for me to apply them without using them. Once in place, I was amazed at how well they stayed in place!<br />They were easy to remove and the eyeliner did require makeup remover to get it off, but it also came off without a problem.<br />I didn't wear them long. I will have to get used to how they feel; it wasn't uncomfortable, just different for me. I have very thin, light-colored eyelashes so I think I'm really going to enjoy these!<br />(Excuse my bad photos too - no other makeup whatsoever on and first attempt so I look pretty awful - lol But I actually love the lashes!)",

Hmmm below is my original review:  It says NOTHING about this product not being \"AUTHENTIC\".<br />HEY AMAZON, the review is ACCURATE because it talks about HOW THE PRODUCT is SHOWN to work & it doesn't deliver! People NEED TO KNOW THAT! This product's Video SHOWS hair that is SMOOTH & SILKY SHINY!  That is the PROMISE!  IT DOESN'T DO THAT!<br />Not sure why my last review was removed, but it IS 100% honest and accurate!  This product doesn't work AS PROMOTED!  I've got LONG hair that is long enough to sit on, keep it well cared for.  The video shows \"silky smooth & super shiny\" hair after using this product.  I've used the entire jar now (that's 4 treatments by the way for hair like mine) and though yes my hair IS soft (but it ALWAYS has been) its' over all look & condition has NOT changed at all!  I was hoping for the silky soft shiny hair shown in the video as I have very curly hair (not looking for STRAIGHT hair, just SMOOTH & SHINY) & it doesn't work!  Over all I would give this product no more then 2 stars since it does smell good, and does leave your hair soft, but so does every other bottled conditioner out there.",

We tried glueing them down but that didn't work long enough to get the lashes attached to the form. The edges kept popping up because again it was flat silicone form that would not shape to the eye. The glue gets gummed up in the lashes and if it dries before you can successfully attach them, they will turn stiff and won't be able to get them on the form and have to start over.  It was very frustrating. If the forms had an adhesive backing it would have solved the problem. I'm just hoping my lashes won't fall out after only being able to get one eye done. So over all, this kit was not worth it for me. It's made in China and for the price it's seriously over priced and not easy to use.

They came in a nice, good quality zip lock bag & weren't smashed, just beautiful!  So I ordered another set so that she would have two of each color (when 2 bows are needed) & I just received the second package. The envelope they were stuffed in caused them to be smashed, they were in 3 different cheap plastic bags, not attractive packaging at all. Not impressed at all, as for the actual bow & colors they are nice. There are a lot of them for a good price.",

I'm hoping to fix my left eye brow (I over plucked it by accident a few years ago and it has never recovered) as well as get thicker lower lashes. My upper lashes are naturally thick but if this helps them grow longer I will be very happy. Been using every day for 1 week now and I think I have seen some new growth but not quite sure.

Easy to keep clean and If you've researched nail care you will find that glass nail files leave the smoothest edges without damaging the nail.<br />You can feel the difference.",

It has adjustable compartments that will fit all your makeup. The brush compartment will easily fit at least 20 brushes. There are 3 layers to this bag to keep your different items separated, such as shampoos, brushes, actual makeup. It also comes with an attached name tag like you use on suitcases. I will more than likely order another 1 or 2 of these for presents in the future for the women in my family, they are really great nice! They did a great job in designing this case!",

I was actually planning on saving it as a stocking stuffer for Christmas time since I start my shopping early for that, but he happened to see it when I was opening the box. It took awhile to be shipped so I forgot I even ordered it or else I wouldn't have opened it in front of him. Oh well. It's a really strong scent. He didn't even take the cap off the bottle and we could really smell it. He says he doesn't mind the scent of it. It's not his favorite but he is willing to wear it and try it out as long as I can handle smelling it. I told him just to not use too much cause it would probably bother me to be around it for too long. Overall it isn't bad, I guess it just depends on someone's preference.

I liked the \"hot pink\" formula the best. I disliked the shimmery one, very glittery, could maybe use as an eye shadow primer or on decolletage. I am a very pale caucasian, and all of these formulas were very very whitening, too pale for me. It did however cover redness and imperfections well. I had to use powder to bring enough color back into my pale skin to look normal, and I always choose the most \"ivory\" of any foundation product. Does not photograph well, looks ghostly.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Nice selection of formulas<br />Enough in each tube for 2-3 uses<br />Creamy, goes on smoothly<br />Did not cause any reaction on my very sensitive dry skin<br />Covers redness well<br />Did not settle in fine lines, wrinkles or dry areas<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very Whitening.<br />Very very pale<br />Does not photograph well.<br />Shimmery formula is very glittery.",
