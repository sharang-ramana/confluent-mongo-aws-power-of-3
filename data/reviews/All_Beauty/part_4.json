I tried it without any spray or holding solution. It adhered fine. The dry particles do brush off without staining. It doesn't run down your face if you sweat but removes easily with shampoo.

    "text": "this leave in conditioner is easy to use. sprayed on damp hair, it is an effective detangler. sprayed on both dry and damp hair, it does provide some softness and moisture to dry, over processed hair. My hair is fine and color treated and is frequently subjected to heat from dryers and curling irons. This did leave it feeling soft and looking healthy. However it didn't do much to refresh my style and the fragrance is strong. It is not an unpleasant aroma, sweet like baby powder and light musk, but not my favorite. It is strong and it lasts all day. The bottle tucks easily into a bag or briefcase and the spray functions smoothly. I wish it either had a difference scent or was fragrance free. I appreciate the exclusion of mineral oil, petrolaltum or artificial coloring. It is an effective product that provides relief to stressed locks.",

I could live without the cut but not the roots.  In desperation I purchased this product and boy was I pleased. The kit comes with directions, the usual skimpy gloves, a small bottle of color and activator.  It mixes easily.  The sponge applicator provides good control.  The product sits for ten minutes (fifteen if you have hard to color hair or alot of gray), rinse out, shampoo and style. Initially I was concerned that the color was too dark but it was great, blended beautifully with my expensive salon color.  It looked as good as what I get at the salon and without the attitude and expense. Recommended.",

This helps to brighten and I really feel like it has made a difference.<br />Now I know I can spend 100 - 200 bucks at any department store makeup counter  and get didn't care products that make a difference and work. But why pay those prices when I can come to Amazon and get something less expensive that works just as well, if not better?<br /> I am less into name brands and more into results.

We received the light blonde wig and in minutes, she had long, white-blonde hair that was straight on top and had curls towards the bottom! This wig's construction is terrific, and it is adjustable.<br />This wig It is made of pretty soft fibers, and you can run your hands over the hair, brush it gently and feel the softness, It has a top tie- on to secure the wig, and the cap lets your scalp breathe. Since it is a rally long haired wig, it is not going to be lightweight: but it doesn't feel heavy on your head. The color is a white/blonde like just like the TV character and the braids on top can be kept, re-braided or let loose to change the style. And although I was able to purchase this wig at a big discount in exchange for my honest review (and my stars cannot be bought, folks, this is truly my unbiased and honest opinion), I think these prices are completely reasonable and I will be buying more for events where my daughter or I need a different  look. Go ahead and try this company's wigs! Have fun with it! We are!",

I was getting rough bumpy patches on the back of my upper arms and the back of my legs and this helps smooth out the skin in those areas. I only need to use it about 3 times a week to maintain a healthy glow so the bottle lasts for a while. I use my regular moisturizer on my off days. In the winter when my skin is super dry I Iayer it under my regular moisturizer to maintain the brightening effect.

My initial attempts were a little messy and it is strange having the weight on your lids.  I never could get the hang of the glue on lashes, so I was hoping these were easier.  If you regularly use liquid liner, these will be easy for you to use.  The hardest part is getting the liner on smooth and straight.  Once it is on, the lashes stick very well to the magnetic bits in the liner.  Also, they come off fairly easily when pulled.  Potentially, it means you could accidentally pull them off if you play with your lashes or rub your eyes.  But they do stay on well, without touching.<br /><br />The lashes are a standard length, so if your eyes are smaller or larger than standard, you may have to adjust - more for smaller than larger.  If you've never worn lashes but have always wanted to try, this is a good way to start.",

I the bottle, the smell of the lotion is horrible - I found it to have a strong, artificial scent similar to alcoholic spirits.  I decided to give it a try so that I could write an accurate review.  The \"lotion\" is quite thin, much more watery than any other moisturizer I have used.  Just to spread on my elbows requires at least 10 pumps from the tiny bottle.  The good news is that once on the skin, the distasteful fragrance does not last; I didn't really detect much scent at all after that, but there may have been a faint hint of rose in the dry-down.  The moisturization was adequate, nothing more.<br /><br />I do like the Nail & Cuticle Oil, which comes in a little roller bottle and actually DOES have a rose scent.  But this set is absolutely NOT worth the cost, especially given that the lotion is likely to be completely gone after just a few weeks of daily use.  Not recommended.<br /><br />NOTE:  At least one other reviewer (\"Jam Blaster\") mentioned the same issue with the lotion smelling bad and gave this product just 1-star as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/1/21:<br />Since I don't like the scent of this product, I decided to try it on my feet.  Despite the lotion being very thin, I actually found it to work quite well on my feet!  I put it on in the a.m., then put on socks; by the end of the day, my feet definitely felt soften and smoother.

I choose the option for the \"mascara brush\" style, as I thought this might be easier to use than the thin brush styles I've tried in the past.  My results with this were mixed.  First, the product is barely discernible on the brush!  It seems only completely dry; more product gets on the wand part than on the brush end.  Second, the brush is plastic and feels VERY harsh; a brush with soft bristles might have been better.<br /><br />That being said, this product has seemed to help my lashes somewhat.  The effect isn't very noticeable with bare lashes, but when I use mascara, my lashes do look thicker and longer than they would normally.  I have used this product on my eyebrows too and have seen some improvement there as well.  I wish this was a little easier to use; I would rate it about three and a half stars.",

I wound up only opening the \"A\" set, as after trying these 5 and finding only 2 to work for me, I decided to give the \"B\" set away.  From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case.  The color I am wearing in the photo is \"Almost Friday,\" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink.  I also kept \"Blush for Me,\" a light, brownish peach.  The red shade, \"Red for Me,\" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection.  But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos.  Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note.  When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality.  Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off.  This might be good for some who carry around lipsticks in a bag, but for quick everyday use, it's annoying.",

My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!  But you can also see that while my lashes are longer, they are still pretty thin/sparse.  Given this, I think this product would work best for those who have thicker but short lashes.",

    "text": "NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product to review.<br /><br />Like the hair on my head, my eyelashes are thin and fine.  Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.",

    "text": "After very minimal and barely noticeable success with whitening toothpastes and gels, I finally decided to give Crest Premium Whitestrips a try.  Previously, I had found the cost to be prohibitive, but the fact that $5 or $7 coupons are offered in our Sunday paper with some regularity made the price a bit easier to swallow.<br /><br />Just like the commercials say, I definitely did begin to see some improvement after about three days.  I would describe the effect as more of a lightening than a whitening per se:  the darker yellow spots on my teeth began to fade and to become less apparent.  Now, after using the product as prescribed for a week, the color of my teeth is clearly improved; I wouldn't say that my teeth are bright white, but they are definitely more of an ivory or a paler yellow color.  According to the package insert, you can immediately begin a second course of treatment for even better whitening effects, but I haven't yet decided if I want to lay out another $30 in order to do this.  Also, I should mention that the effect is not so dramatic thta anyone has noticed (UNLIKE in the commercials!).<br /><br />Now for the caveats.  First of all, I found these strips to be a bit difficult to use.  It can be hard to remove the strips from the protective backing without them becoming mangled, and it is very easy to get the gel on your fingertips (which causes a temporary whitening effect).  Also, the strips are not ideally shaped for your mouth, and I found that they covered my front eight teeth only.  Finally, while the top strip adhered fairly well, I found that the bottom strip was more tricky and tended to slide around, especially if I moved my mouth at all.  The only solution I found to this was to wear the strips while commuting to work, which luckily gave me a 30-minute period when I did not need to talk.  Otherwise, it can be difficult to find a good time to wear the strips, as the insert information advises against wearing them immediately after you brush your teeth, while sleeping, and while you are eating/drinking.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the taste of the strips:  I could not detect anything while wearing them, and after taking them off, I thought that the gooey paste left behind was virtually tasteless.  I did experience some sensitivity in a lower tooth which I had capped over 20 years ago.  Although this sensation went away in time, it was uncomforable enough to make me cut the lower strip to fit around this particular tooth.<br /><br />In summary, I did see clear--although not miraculous--results from this product and I would be willing to try the strips again, especially if the price were to come down a bit.  Ultimately, I would rate Crest Whitestrips three and a half stars, as there is definitely room for improvement.",

It comes in a generic box with everything tossed into it, which makes it feel like a random assortment of products rather than a unified kit. It includes two different but reputable brands (Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and an Indian Clay Mask) as well as an assortment of mixing supplies (pink bowl, measuring spoons, spatula, brush). The pink plastic supplies are dollar quality and feel very cheap while the ACV and clay mask are full size products that can be used together as indicated on the DIY recipe or on their own. The mask jar doesn't specify that ACV must be used so I assume you can use it on your own or have it diluted with water. The ACV can be used for many other applications including drinking for general health.<br /><br />Overall I like the quality of the two products - the other supplies felt unnecessary and extraneous, but I guess you can charge more by including them. But I'd rather just use my own bowls. Overall it's a good quality kit and it gives you a nice at-home facial. I tried it once and my skin does look brighter than usual. However, they warn you not to leave it on for more than 5-10 minutes as it can irritate your skin.",

I own many quartz facial rollers but this one is high quality and well-made. It works similar to the ReFa carat tool but without the high price tag. It pinches your skin a bit when you roll it but that's necessary to improve skin circulation. In addition to anti-aging benefits, it's also great for smoothing out any moisturizer or makeup foundation you've applied and prevents caking.

It consists of coffee colored crystals. You get a lot - about 8.8 ounces worth. I rubbed it on my legs and under the soles of my feet. There is a slight oiliness to the scrub that you often don't get from other scrubs - it's probably from the essential oils. After rinsing it off, I felt my dry skin feel much softer and hydrated. It really provides a nice semi-spa experience.<br /><br />The price, however, is off the charts. I've used many scrubs and I'm not sure this one is worth the cost.

There is also no alcohol in the formula so it's best used for wiping your face rather than disinfecting your hands - for that you're better off using something with alcohol in it to kill the germs.

The bottle is filled with tiny \"pearls\" suspended in a gel solution that reminds me of bubble tea. The serum that comes out is supposedly infused with fermented pearl extract. In Asia, eternal beauty is often represented by pearls and so they're attributed with some mystical powers of youthful rejuvenation and powers of preservation. So it goes with this serum - the lotion has a shimmering effect mimicking that of pearls. It is very smooth and creamy, and leaves my skin glowing.<br /><br />Whether this serum has actual anti-aging effects is questionable. My wrinkles haven't gone away at all. I've been using it only a few weeks and will update my review if I see any significant change to my face.

They look like dry wipes but once you add water, it suds up really well and is perfect for washing your face free of makeup. It can also be reused as a regular wipe after the first use, just hang up and let dry. There isn't much of a scent, which is fine by me as strong fragranced wipes are bad for my allergies. Overall a nice product though not the most environmentally friendly with all the packaging.",

    "text": "This \"facial kit\" has all the items you'd expect to get in a spa gift basket, only it's shipped in a cardboard box reminiscent of subscription boxes. The main difference is that it's a one-time deal, no subscription needed, and all the items are grouped together by theme and color. I ordered the \"gold\" theme and was a little disappointed that not all the items are gold colored (the eye mask is blue) and there's a mix of drugstore items with some more luxurious feeling ones.<br /><br />I'll start with the good. The box is very cute, with the words \"It's a great day to love your face\" greeting you when you open the box. Inside you get a five count box of sheet Masks that contain retinol, a generous and thick box of facial wipes, a Gold under-eye pad to reduce lines and puffiness, and a gold Lip Mask (I've never used a \"lip mask\" before so this seems a little bizarre, if fun). The blue eye mask is filled with gel beads so you can use it hot or cold, and the cheapest and least impressive items are the \"facial buff\" (a pear-shaped sponge that looks like something you'd clean your pots with) and a  \"facial cleansing brush\" that looks a little cheap but is nevertheless useful.<br /><br />The main thing that was missing was some packing peanuts or confetti, as the items were tossed into the box hither and thither with NO padding, whereas other gift baskets and boxes typically include some stuffing so that the items are more artfully displayed. This one wasn't, so if I were giving this to someone as a gift, I'd certainly add it so the items wouldn't arrive in a jumble. But otherwise, I liked it.",

Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br /><br />Previously:<br />These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed out as much product as I could, I still had leftover polish on the edges of my fingers. Not wanting to waste a whole other cloth to finish the job, I blotted the remainder using a cotton ball and my usual polish remover.<br /><br />Overall, it's strong and will remove most of your polish, but the cost of this product is higher than if you stocked up on a few bottles of nail polish remover and used cotton balls. But if you're traveling, it would definitely be  more convenient and I suppose that's what you're be paying for. But be prepared to use 2 cloths at a time to get it all off, which adds up to only 5 uses.",

I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would have been faster.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and I like the glossy finish. There hasn't been any serious chipping or loss of polish for a week now, but I've used other gel polishes that have lasted almost as long as the LED kind.  And for those who like to change their polish often, preserving the same look for a week or two isn't a priority. So unlike you already have some sort of LED lamp, I would just stick to the normal gel polishes available out there.",

    "text": "This is a small bottle of powder that comes with a tiny spoon.  You dab a bit of the white powder into your hand and mix it with your regular moisturizer, which you then apply to your face. I used a little water and my usual Aveeno moisturizer with SPF 15 sunblock.  My face does look a little brighter after using it for a week but the effect is somewhat similar to using a light-colored makeup foundation.  Unfortunately it has little effect on my crow's-feet or my small &quot;laugh lines&quot;. It's OK but since I can get the same effect applying certain types of makeup or concealers, it's chief benefit is that it's good to use when you don't want to wear makeup and want something that has a lighter feel on your face. Otherwise, the price is kind of high for what you get.",

Typically I make my own from organic ingredients, so I am picky and compare. I was very happy with the Alexa coffee body scrub. The package is a nice size at 8 oz. It also would make a wonderful gift if you are needing a quality pampering for someone.<br /><br />You can just get your feet wet if you are doing a pedicure with it. All you have to do is get your body wet, or the particular area you are using it on. I put a smidgen between my fingers and only use it on key body dry areas. If you want to slather it all over that is ok too! I just like to make it last because it is nice on my skin. I have several dry eczema areas and dry areas on my feet.<br /><br />I have used other brands and had to transfer it into another container of my own, I love that with this one I didn't have to! It is not to cumbersome in the shower, the package is easy to open and close. The Alexa brand is made in the USA with organic all natural moisturizers. My skin is soft silky smooth with the combination of the great ingredients of dead sea salt, organic oils, organic coffee and organic shea butter. I used the scrub on my hands, feet, upper arms and legs. The scrub doesn't leave behind an oily residue, just a nice soft skin feeling. It's great for light exfoliating. Scrub, rub and rinse! I received this product at a discount in return for a review and my honest and unbiased opinion.",

These products come in a pair for a reason.<br /><br />Alright, I'll get to the point. Does the product do what it says?<br />In so many words, yes, most definitely.<br />My experience with the products was as follows.<br />First, I mistakenly used the cream on my legs during my shower as a way of lubricating the massager.<br /><br />TIP: This is incorrect... I know that now.<br /><br />Luckily, I din't waste much and my experience with the brush was actually really great. Massaging is painless and since its manual, you get to choose the level of pressure you feel you ought to apply.<br />One caveat--do not over rub. I did so and ended up bursting my bum, waking up the following morning with bits of--what I assume was--busted blood cells. I even bruised a bit. Long story short, go easy on yourself and do not massage too often. I would suggest about four times a week as a maximum.<br /><br />The cream itself is nice. I've used it about 5 times now, and I can already so a minor difference. Although I generally attribute this to the massager, the cream does leave the skin feeling tighter for sure. It does remain sticky for a couple of seconds (about 45...less than a minute, not bad) but drys completely.<br /><br />My experience has taught me that, by using the correct products correctly, you can actually get rid of cellulite.<br /><br />Last and final point; I'm not sure how permanent this is, however, massaging and creaming really isn't that much of a hassle. Any hey, if it keeps the cellulite off...<br /><br />Disclaimer: Free for review.",

I wake with puffy eyes, semi wrinkles coming in at age 50. After cleansing my face I turn to this to work it's magic. It only takes a very small amount to apply. I've never used the word shocked in a review but what I saw within a 2 minute period did just that. The area under my eyes instantly smoothed out & looked as if I had skin of a 20yo again. The longer I let it sit before applying my serum & moisturizer the more smoothing & softened the area became. This isn't a harsh eye cream. I had no stinging, no bad reaction, it worked perfectly for my skin. There's no scent to it. It comes nicely out of the dispenser. The smoothed & tightened area that I've clearly noticed remains this way even after the rest of my facial regime. I've never had anything like this before with truly how rapid it works on my skin upon applying. This morning I used it & moisturized my face only. What an amazing difference that again has lasted. Rapid Reduction it definitely is. A 1 ounce tube will last me awhile since a little goes a long way. Genuine quality with this cream & I highly recommend it. You'll see the results!",

    "text": "Elizabeth Mott $et for Life Loose Setting Powder is the 1st type of powder that has kept my oily skin under control all day long. It's a light powder that comes out of the container through little holes so I have control over how much powder I want in the top of the container where I pick up the powder with my makeup brush. The design is wonderful. It's sheer & applies nicely with my discretion. It's the last product I put on my face in the morning. I don't wear foundation or any of that. After cleansing I use toner (not everyday) then my moisturizer with sunscreen & primer. Finally I'm complete this great face setting powder. I've never found anything that keeps my face in place before I found this. Hours later no oil can be seen on my face~and my skin is oily! Late afternoon I may use the face blotting tissues to set my face more, depending on where/what I'm doing. Even then little oil shows through. In the past I've used a matte powder which worked but not as good as this. My skin color would be considered beige in the matte powder so I was hesitant on this “Translucent” color but it blends in wonderfully. I don't look too pale or too dark. I love it! This is my 2nd purchase & my 1st lasted a long time. So I'm set for life & I highly recommend it if you have oily skin.",

I love the way it looks just to sit out for decoration.<br />Mirror is light weight yet the base is heavy.  The mirror does turn over to have normal side then to flip it is magnified.  The best part of this mirror is it is LED illuminated.  It took 3 AA batteries which were supplied.  The toggle switch is on the base and when illuminated it gives that cool glow.  I love plucking my eyebrows with this mirror.  Easy to see and with the added light it works well.  The light is very vibrant and puts off a very nice glow.  Lights are on both sides.<br />I would consider all materials high quality by the apperance and by the weight.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely satisfied with this dual sided mirror.  It has been a great item added to my makeup collection.  Works well to sit on the vanity to give you an additional mirror for up close application and for the magnification.

    "text": "This is a good set of contouring colors.  It has a huge range of colors needed for dark skin, to light skin, It even includes a white cream for highlighting along with some green and pinks to even out skin tone.  Basically this set is a great set to start with and to have on hand for when your skin goes thru some funky changes.  We all have that happen from time to time.  Anyways my contouring kit is a cream set of 15 colors.  Each color is very creamy and I had no issues with blending and rubbing in.  However I always use a high quality primer with all makeup so that may add to the easy technique of blending into the mixture.  Each color has its advantages along with its disadvantages.  Like I said not every color is going to suit your needs so If you are looking for specific colors this is not the set for you, this is a range of colors for different shades of skin.<br />The makeup seemed to be long wearing but please dont forget that I used primer and that could have something to do with makeup wear length.  I also did not break out with this cream as I have done with so many other colors.  Of course I made sure to clean my face off each evening and I never slept in it at all.  The plastic holding the makeup tins is a hard black plastic,  I wouldnt call it super high quality but its not the cheapest I have come across.  The reason for 4 stars is because I prefer mirrors in the compact as sometimes I like to have my makeup in hand while applying and it would be nice if a mirror was included.  However it takes no value away from the makeup its just my personal preference.  I also need to research some of these ingredients,  (which I havent done as of yet while writing the review)  I have not recongized a couple and usually most ingredients I am somewhat familiar with as I am a makeup fanatic.  Nothing jumps out and screams do not put on your face though.  I also wish the ingredients was listed on the hard plastic case so once you dispose of the box which everyone does you still have a list of ingredients in case you have some delayed reaction after long term use.  Another reason for 4 stars.  However overall I am pleased with this makeup palette.  It seems to be well suited for a starter pack for those learning to contour, and those whose skin goes thru some weird skin tones from time to time.  My only complaints were the ones listed above and no others.  Makeup seems to spread smoothly and blends well.  Which is what most women prefer when it comes to contouring.  I did notice it did take several coats and more during application than what I am used to however compared to regular drug store kits its pretty comparable to it, may be a tad better in quality as it blends easily.<br />I received this makeup palette for free for testing and reviewing purposes,  I have come to this conclusion by using and wearing this makeup for a few days myself.",

The case can then be rolled over and tied for easy carrying and storage for your brushes.  I have used all of these brushes and found that each brush seems to be soft bristles, and designed to do different makeup applications.  Love each of these brushes.  Although the brushes werent super saturated with makeup, I went a head and washed them to test the durability of the bristles.  Once washed with a mild brush wash they dried nicely and the bristles remained soft and I had no fibers falling out of the brush.  Each brush handle is wood and painted pink.  Love the girly factor.  Handles fit in my hand well and I had no issues with makeup application..<br />I received a beauty sponge.  It worked well with liquid foundation application ( just remember to wet and squeeze the water out of it before using) the sponge is super absorbent so if not wet it will absorb the makeup just like any beauty sponge.<br />This sponge is nice and soft and washed up well also.<br />Overall I am very satisfied with this set of brushes.

    "text": "Arrived ahead of time which was super cool! I was incredibly excited to try this product out after seeing the buzzfeed video with them using it.<br />When I first opened the package, I was a bit shocked at how big of a bottle it was but how it seemed like barely half was full. When attempting to squeeze is out it was very much like trying to get the last of a product out of a container just as you're about to run out of it. All air, very little inside.<br />I did a small test area just to see if there was any kind of crazy reaction and I didn't have any issues. Goes on, peels off, wash away any little flakes that don't peel with it. However, when I went back to do a full mask I noticed that even though I had totally sealed it up tight, within about 20 minutes a massive amount of the product had leaked into the lid. I cleaned it up so it didn't solidify and placed the bottle upside down, so the lid was facing up instead.<br />The full mask itself went on nice and easy, just like the test. When I peeled it off, I did notice my skin felt fresher but it didn't really pull anything out. I checked the peeled off mask itself and while it had plenty of little itty bitty hairs from my face, nothing really noticeable. I checked out problem areas in the mirror and they looked basically the same, maybe with some blackheads and things closer to the surface and drawn up so they could be removed. The effect was minimal though and pretty disappointing.<br />I'll finish it off since there isn't much left and there is no point in not using it, but I won't be buying any more after this.",

I have 3 bottles from 3 different places, 3 different colors (blue white and black) and the blue one is good, the white one is meh, and the black one is completely useless.  The white and black have bent brushes, and the white polish is a bit dried out but not the worst, kind of reminds me of using white-out before they changed the formula and it got all watery and they changed to a sponge applicator from a brush.  The black one is awful - it's literally just clumps of dried out polish with some occasional damp spots.  The blue one is okay, the polish is alright, but I wouldn't recommend using the brushes that came with these but buying a separate skinny brush for line work or whatever it is you want to do.<br /><br />I should mention I have been using them to fix an enameled piece of jewelry as opposed to doing nails, as that's what the jeweler recommended (nobody local repairs enamel resin and buying enamel is very expensive and you end up with a ton leftover), so a jeweler I trust recommended nail polish with a good resin sealant and that's what I've been doing.  Initially I had used an X-Acto knife to cut painter's tape around the shapes of different colors and metal but switched to this pink-colored liquid latex paint I saw on a youtube video for nail designs and it's much easier.",

I tested this on my hands and omg did my hands feel amazingly soft afterward. It's late and I am too tired to try on my feet but I am now really looking forward to my next shower!<br /><br />I do think this will preform best a bit dry first then dampen.

What I don't particularly care for is, with usage, my hair has to be washed every other day or it ends up looking greasy, limp and stringy. Also, the smell is definitely a medicinal odor with the Taila. But the results outweigh my complaints: Considerably less flaking of my very dry scalp, less shedding (yeah, I lose hair like a Husky), receding hairline seems less so, and sometimes I have to actually search for my small truly bald spot at the back of my crown rather than it displaying itself at every opportunity. A pleasant surprise this second time around is that some of the new growth is coming in my natural black rather than silver or white as it had been. This was totally unexpected at my age, although I did read it might stem greying. Makes it look like I have more hair at my hairline with the darker strands growing in. So ignore my complaints.

However, the serum itself works very nicely for my skin. I will not be purchasing it again, though.

If it were thinner on the ends, it'd have actually blended better with MY long hair. That said, I should've gotten 20&#34; as I underestimated my hair length. So I ended up trimming 2&#34; off of the thinner ends of MY hair and it has that kinda 'choppy' look. I like it! So far so good. I did use a hair dryer to warm up the adhesive and pinch tightly afterwords. Hope it'll last! But I'll get the black and silver next time.<br /><br />Another Update: this hair is NOT STRAIGHT hair. It is permanently tightly wavy. Need a straightener to make it straight. Lost another star, now a 3*. Should be 2* because it has failed its description.",

I'm lucky in that my face at it's not-the-most-tan tiny works well with the light color but I can see how the limited color choices can be a deal breaker for some. It's smooth and not cakey, it blends well, feels weightless, and stands up to sweating and long work days with great shine prevention and it doesn't come off easily (a little when you blow your nose etc). I do not like the porcelain doll look and this works well for me for evening out tones.  I am 35 and have very sensitive skin, several minor facial scars, and occasional adult acne and this doesn't have any negative effects on my skin at all. It washes off easily with gentle face wash. It allows for a few spot touches of stick concealer, blends well, and holds well. Mine arrived with no breaks/cracks and the sponge works well. I really like the protective inner plastic case between the powder and the lid and sponge. Will buy again! I previously used Revlon, Covergirl, Neutrogena, and JUNGSAEMMOOL Essential Star-cealer Foundation which I was happy with the first time and then the following two were slimy and just not working well. For reference my current face tone is a revlon 300-310, a covergirl 705-710, and Starcealer Light. After peak summer I'm a more 310-320, 710-715, and Starcealer Medium (almost, its still a little dark for me).",

    "text": "I bought this oil after using their avocado oil. Life-Flo is a great brand. I've never had issues with any of their products. This oil is food grade, cold pressed. It is a lighter weight than their avocado oil, but it works just as well. I use this on my son who is two to help his skin retain moisture (he has severe eczema). I put a cap full in his bath and apply it all over after his bath while he is still damp. His skin is soft and his eczema spots are softer, not as rough, but I still have to apply a layer of Vaseline to his rough patches to keep him from scratching and to keep his spots super moisturized. I use it on his scalp also once a week. I massage it through his hair and let it soak in while he's playing in the tub and I follow it put by shampooing his hair like normal. It absorbs quickly, and I do apply it throughout the day when I change his diaper. It doesn't have a scent to it really, which is a plus since I have to be careful with perfumes with him. It does make your tub slippery if you add it to your bath water, I always clean the tub after his bath to be on the safe side. We usually go through a 12 oz bottle every six months so it lasts a while compared to a gel baby oil (we go through one of them a month if we use it).  A little bit goes a long way. This oil used in conjunction with Vaseline and his prescription meds helps keeps his eczema in check, and I have discovered that we are using his prescription med less since we swapped over to this oil. For us this oil is more effective than coconut, avocado, baby oil, ceteaphil, or aveeno.  If it's for eczema we have tried it. He's had eczema since he was 3 months old and I feel like we finally found a product that I know is safe to use, it's all natural, no chemicals, and it's within budget.",

My husband had warned me of the dangers of using blades, and I've cut my feet several times. I read many reviews on this product and others before purchasing. It came in 2 days and had a charge when it arrived.  I keep it plugged in so it's ready whenever my husband or I are needing to use it. I'm very pleased with this product, and very happy that I purchased this.  It works very well and does a great job, and I use it at least once a week to keep my feet really soft. My husband also uses it about once a week also, to keep his feet smooth.  He was shot in the foot and the bullet fragments are still in his foot, and he gets calluses where the fragments are in his foot. I also purchased the extra rollers, but haven't had to change the original one out yet.  Those who complained about this product must not have used it properly.  When using don't press down thinking that extra pressure will help, it's not designed to be used like that.  Just lightly touch the area you want to treat and the file will definitely work well. For those who have a lot of hard calluses, you might want to either soak your feet first to soften the skin,  or use it everyday for a couple of days until you get the best results.  You don't want to over do it because you may cause your feet to be sore. I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this wonderful gadget to anyone.  It will definitely save you a lot of money on getting pedicures elsewhere!",

Aside from glycerin, the other touted ingredients are almost halfway down, or lower, on the ingredients list, or are not so skin friendly. Green tea is wonderful for your skin, but it is near the bottom of the ingredients list. Also, the type of vitamin C, Ascorbyl Palmitate, is not very skin friendly, and can actually be very irritating to sensitive skin, like mine.<br />This moisturizer may work well for those with very dry skin, but I would have liked to see the boasted about skin loving ingredients closer to the top of the ingredients list. Full transparency is always best, and will make customers happy. Listing some wonderful ingredients that are minimally effective in very small amounts, is a bit misleading. This moisturizer has way too many oils for my skin, is a bit irritating, and is not my favorite...",

It doesn't open.<br />The device does look quite fancy, and I was interested in skin rejuvenation, which is in one of the photos (that is mentioned in the other listing that shows this exact same device). The instruction booklet contains about as much as the empty listing page that I ordered it from. That page has no bullet points, only one photo.<br />They do have another listing for this same exact device, showing the accessories, extra photos with bits of information, and bullet points telling a little about it. I got my information from there.<br />The device does have the cooling feature, as many others do, which helps it not to zap too badly. It also comes with a razor and eye protection.<br />What it lacks, that many others include that are in or around this price range, is more attachments for the device. There needs to be at least one smaller light head for use around the lip area, as it's very hard to use the main one with the device being so large.<br />This IPL device works pretty much as well as any other, with none having the ability to make you completely hair-free at any point in the future. As far as the studies that I have seen, with diligent use, home IPL devices can only offer a little better than 50-60%-ish less hair.<br />My preferred device, which costs very little more than this one, has several attachments, including some specifically for skin rejuvenation. You do get a fancy box with this device, and it looks nice, but I don't think it provides any more or less than devices that cost much less.<br />I haven't found one yet that really only takes 10 minutes to do your legs, but if I ever do, that is the one that would probably take the cake! If you like fancy boxes and a sleek-looking device, I would recommend this one.",

They also have great staying power, but can be washed away quickly with any cleanser.<br />My eyelids are naturally oily, so I have to add a wisp of translucent powder over top, so they won't stay tacky. They still keep the shimmer, too, which is not overdone. It is just right for my 51 year young self to wear and not look silly, just elegant.<br />I love this eyeshadow stick set! From the colors to the ease of use, it just works well. The colors would look beautiful on anyone's skin tone, and they are great for a busy schedule. It is easy to place them all into a pretty cosmetic jar or even a drawer for quick access.<br />They come nicely packaged and are more than worthy of gifting to any makeup lover.

They will do well for a newbie, until they figure out if they like the process.

Any slight tackiness is taken care of after applying a good moisturizer to help lock in all the good stuff. It has a very light, hardly noticeable scent.<br />It really hydrates my skin and plumps my fine lines and wrinkles. My skin looks and feels better when using it. I have combination skin, but use Retin-A, which can be a bit drying and sometimes irritating. This serum really calms the irritation, yet enhances the anti-aging effects of the Retin-A.<br />This serum is a great every day serum.

But, I think it would just be more for the fun of it and very short lived. This is also very expensive \"Cologne\" to not be able to smell it after 30 minutes, and right at $28 is too expensive for me to buy just for the fun of it.  <br />For others this \"Baby Cologne\" may be something wonderful or maybe they can smell it more than I can. As I said, I really love the idea of a light fragrance, but not for babies. I do wish the scent stuck around more for me.",

    "text": "This is a great sampler set by KRISNICE. You get a black polish to use as a base or on its own, a couple of color changing polishes, a couple of cat eye polishes, and a sparkly red polish. They are all beautiful and the effects all work well. The cat eyes do require a few coats to get good coverage, and a bit of practice with the magnet to get a good design. The good thing about those are, you can always swipe through the design and start over till you get something you like, and then cure. I love the color changing ones the best, but they only show two toned on longer nails. Otherwise, they just change from one color to another, which is still pretty.<br />The huge thing about this company's sets that I don't like, is they are not labeled. Yes, you get stickers to swatch, but they don't stick! You end up having to glue them on or make other swatches. I really wish they would label or swatch the bottles. I'm starting to not get polish from brands that don't label. It's just such a hassle.<br />Overall, I love all the colors and effects. You can really come up with some unique nail designs with this set. I love the color change with one layer of the purple cat eye over top. This is a good mix and a lot of fun! I would recommend",

It is made from cheap materials and has several defects.<br />The clasp is so thinly made, that it is easily bent just from disengaging it from the spine.  There is a gouge on one spine that goes in on one side and out on the other. And, the razor blade does not stay seated properly once clasped. The wooden scales are not neatly finished. The blades that come with it are not the snap kind. They are full double sided blades, making them more dangerous to have to cut them without getting cut. They are also very thin and cheap. There's no way I can shave a neck, sideburns, facial hair, etc., with this defective razor.<br />I could have overlooked cosmetic issues regarding a razor of this price point. It is the physical defects that hindered its use that are major problems for me.<br />I contacted the seller, but was told that I could keep the defective product, and \"we recommend another straight for you, better than that one in your hand\", and I was given the asin number, so I could purchase it. This was not only poor Customer Service, but a lack of confidence in this, their own product. If they don't recommend this razor, I certainly don't either. It really could have gone much better.",

    "text": "This Belle polygel kit is a great starter set from beginner to expert levels. It has some beautiful neutral colors, along with a white, and gorgeous glitters. They are all half ounce size tubes that will create a few sets of nails each, or you can mix and match the colors to make them go farther.<br />This kit includes; Six .5 oz. polygel colors, primer, gel base and top coats, a nail strengthener, cuticle oil, slip solution, dual forms, polygel brush with spatula, nail clips, and alcohol wipes. It comes nicely packaged in a lovely black box with cutouts to hold everything in place.<br />At minimum, you will need to supply your nail prep and finishing tools and liquids, such as: cuticle pusher and possibly nippers, a buffer, and nail dehydrator/alcohol, but these are things you will want to keep in good supply, anyways.<br />This polygel is so easy to work with. It is not too hard nor too soft. It's very easily workable with the provided slip solution. Even a beginner will have no trouble using it. Just remember, that if your surrounding temperature gets too cold or too hot, it affects the viscosity of the polygel, so work in a room that feels nice.<br />I did two nail swatches; one solid glitter and the other a French manicure with a shimmery twist. As I said, the polygel applied so easily, it also cured as expected without any problems, and the end results turned out beautiful.<br />I have to say that when I received my Belle polygel kit, there was a small issue with my order. I contacted their customer service and was met with such kindness and prompt service. They answered all my questions very quickly and respectfully. They're promptness in solving my problem, and their patience in dealing with my questions, shows me that they really care about their customers. Knowing that they were not privy to my customer status lets me know that they will treat all customers the same.<br />The colors are all so beautiful, and the glitters really make a statement. This set would make a great addition to anyone's collection and would also make a wonderful gift. Knowing this polygel kit is also backed by Belle, a wonderful company who really values their customers, makes a great product even better. I would most definitely recommend it!",

I can't say which one it is for sure, but I suspect it's the snail mucin that made a noticeable and immediate difference in my skin.<br />My forehead skin has a few dimples and I have some fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes. I am 50 years old, but I've been using Retin-A for several years now. I've had a mostly natural skin care routine, other than the Retin-A, but recently decided to try a few of the K-beauty products out. This one was the first I used, and with the first use I can see my forehead and wrinkles were much smoother, along with the rest of my skin, as well. It also gave my skin a brighter look. With each use, it just gets better and better.<br />A little definitely goes a long way. Its texture is slimy, but I've found that I only need a very small amount to cover my face, and it massages in so easily. I also apply it to my neck & decollete.<br />I'm so glad that I tried this, and now I will just keep adding to it until I get the full K-beauty routine down.

    "text": "I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces, put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br />I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These are definitely on my must-have list. Highly recommend!",

Though this #8 brush is smaller than all of my other #8 brushes, it works very well when applying acrylics. Whenever I get a new brush, I always do a burn test on a few of the bristle strands. The bristles in this brush are some kind of natural fiber or fur, but I can't say that it's a Kolinsky Sable, as true Kolinsky Sable is usually much more expensive. The bristles are rather short, leaving me to wonder how well the brush will hold up in the long run, but it should last a while..<br />Overall this is a nice acrylic nail brush, that has a very pretty pattern on its handle. It works well when applying acrylics, and I've had no problems with bristle loss. I would recommend this brush to those who are just starting out or those looking for a good budget brush.",

    "text": "After going over the ingredients in these products, the only two I would feel even remotely safe using would be this shampoo and conditioner. As a hair stylist, you do not want to use a product that contains formaldehyde and apply heat to it. You certainly do not want to use it every 6 weeks, as it's harmful to your health. It can cause breathing issues among other things. It's very hard to believe that I even saw actual formaldehyde on the back of this product, and so high up in the ingredients list.<br />Even hair stylist must wear protective gear, such as gloves, aprons, masks, and be trained how to safely work with this hazardous chemical. Salons must have adequate ventilation and follow strict protocols regarding blow dryer temperatures and monitor formaldehyde levels at all times when they provide Keratin Treatments containing formaldehyde because of the immediate and long term health dangers.This is something you cannot possibly do at home.<br />Also, the pretreatment that you add to the shampoo is extremely strong and stripping to your hair. When they say add just a little, no one knows what that means. That particular product, or the two main ingredients, should only be a small percentage of the product you're adding it to. I don't think you can mix this properly at home without causing damage to your hair and/or your skin.<br />I \"might\" use the shampoo and conditioner, but I will not touch the pre-treatment nor will I touch the DIY home keratin treatment. Over the course of a few treatments, I can see this product going really awry for some people. They will end up with damaged hair and possibly other problems. It is not safe. I absolutely would not recommend it!",

    "text": "The name of these masks really throws you off. It makes you think they are supposed to be used with an LED light, but they are not. Upon opening one of the mask packages, I wasn't expecting a gooey, in between a cream and lotion, to start leaking out. It's not like a Serum at all.<br />The mask itself is quite thin, but it's not at all easy to tear. I read that one reviewer commented that it rips easily. On the contrary, it's quite difficult to even tear it. I actually had to use scissors to cut it for a use that I will explain later. It is a good size, covering all areas quite well. The cutouts for the eyes are quite small, which I like because it really gets to the under-eye area without it getting into your eyes.<br />I left it on for 20 minutes, and then did as another reviewer did, and cut it up and put it on my neck & decollete for another 20 minutes, with the rest of the cream/lotion that was left in the package.<br />This mask is extremely moisturizing and did not sink into my skin completely afterwards. I had used Retin-A the night before, so my face was quite dry, and really needed moisture and nutrients. But, I think it is a little too oily for my skin. My skin was still so oily hours later that I had to blot it with a microfiber facial cloth. The next day my skin felt great, though, without any ill effects.<br />These are very moisturizing and emollient masks, and would be great for someone with extremely dry skin. For me, I think these will work well using them once a week or every other week, when my skin is at its driest. For five masks, I think the price point is just right. I would definitely recommend these. Especially for those with very dry skin.",

    "text": "This is only my second time using a face mask, and this one was a much better experience than the last. I chose the morning to do the mask while I was having my morning coffee, checking the computer, and using my LED White light therapy lamp. The Mask itself is made of a very durable fabric like material that does not tear. The serum is nice and silky feeling without any scent, that I could tell. I appreciate that, as I have a sensitivity to certain smells.<br />For me, the mask was a little bit short on the forehead and not wide enough on the cheeks. I don't have a large face at all, and I had quite a bit of skin left to cover around the sides and top.<br />There's an ample amount of serum left in the package that I was able to keep re-wetting the mask with, as it seemed to dry fairly quickly. I also rubbed some on my neck and decollete. I left it on for about an hour, so that my skin could soak in as much as possible. I then used the mask to rub the rest on my neck, decollete, and the backs of my hands. I wanted to make use of every bit I could. I use Retin-A on my face, and had done a treatment the night before, so my skin really needed the hydration and nourishment. It looked and felt very hydrated and nourished afterwards.<br />The only thing I did not care for was that my skin was very sticky after removing the mask, and it stayed that way. I ended up having to take a damp cloth and blotting it off. After that, my face felt a bit greasy, and I had to keep blotting it until it was time for my bedtime skincare routine.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed using this mask and will be using it at least once a week. It is very hydrating and nourishing, I just wish it didn't leave the sticky and greasy feeling behind. Maybe, I left it on too long, as I do have combination normal to oily skin. Next time I will only leave it on for about 15 minutes, as I think that may work much better for me. I would definitely recommend this mask, but would also recommend starting with less time than I did if you have combination to oily skin.",

    "text": "This mirror really wants to be elegant looking. It has a pearlized finish with some elegant swirls at the top, but it really just looks like a plastic vanity mirror that should come with one of the Barbie mannequin heads that little girls put makeup on and do their hair.<br />The mirror has three light settings, bright white, really yellow, and I'm assuming a daylight, which is the only light I can somewhat see myself a little bit with it on. Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless. Each mirror, in and of itself, is nice and clear and seems great. One might think of recycling them, or a young girl may find better use of this vanity mirror as she's playing dress up, or learning to do makeup. For myself, because I cannot see into it with the lights on, as it's meant to be used, and I don't find it aesthetically pleasing to display, I will not be using it.",

I use these types of oils to make my own facial oil mix or to add to my moisturizer.<br />The thing I absolutely hate that companies do to try to sell their products is to say things that aren't true. The USDA does not certify oils - food, cosmetic, or otherwise. The fact that the bottle says this product is USDA certified on one side, and the other side says not intended for ingestion should speak volumes. The USDA certifies and regulates the welfare and production of food products; meaning products that you ingest. So, why on earth would they certify a product you cannot ingest? The bottle also makes outright claims of known cures from using these oils. There is no disclaimer on either bottle that states that these claims have not been approved or proven by the FDA, or whatever the disclaimer is that is mandatory. There are ingredients listed, one ingredient for each product, the oil, and that's it. Nothing tells how these oils were extracted. Therefore, we do not know if they are refined or unrefined. They probably don't know either. So you see, therein lies the lies and deception.<br />These oils would be much better if they weren't tied to lies. Because you know what they say about lies... if you tell one you have to tell more to keep up with the first one. Is what they say in the bottle really what's in the bottle? Are they pure oils or mixed with a lesser oil? Oils are greasy. If they are unrefined, why aren't they greasy? When you refine oils, you take away a lot of their natural properties and their nutritive value, is that why they aren't greasy? Because of the lies and lack of important information, I really don't know for sure what these oils are.<br />Because of the deceptive practices and claims made, I would not recommend these or any of their other oils.",

Upon first opening this flosser, it's very unique and different and would be great for traveling. The way the pieces of it fit together so compactly into each other, and then into a very nice fabric zip case with a handle, definitely sets this flosser apart.<br />When I used it, I found that it did not have near the amount of pressure that I'm used to from my other flosser. As nice as it is, it didn't feel as if it was cleaning between my teeth very well. I felt it gave a nice surface clean, but the pressure of the water was not enough to force out any particles from in between my teeth.<br />The flosser is also extremely loud. I've had the one I'm using for quite a while, and though it makes some noise, it isn't loud enough to hear from a couple of rooms away with the door shut. This one was scary loud. I'm not sure if it may have a defect or not, so others may not have this problem.<br />For me, this flosser does not have enough power behind it, and it is just too loud for my liking.

You also get a base and topcoat, an application tool, and a couple of glitters. This would make the perfect kit if it didn't have a few issues.<br />So far, I've only used the clear and white poly gels to create a French tip design. They are a bit tackier than I would like them to be, which makes them harder to work with. They also take quite a bit longer to fully cure under an LED UV light than most other poly gels. I did use tips and dual forms. When I remove the dual forms after curing them for 60 seconds on top and bottom, they were still tacky on top. I had to cure them for another 30 seconds. My nails only lasted a little over a week before starting to lift around the edges. This is hardly a long-lasting poly gel, in my opinion.<br />I'm a still licensed but retired nail technician, so I am very well aware and knowledgeable on how to prep nails properly.

I did do some research and watched several videos to learn the process before even venturing into trying my own. Boy, I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into... This is nothing like my beloved Acrylics! But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro \"lift proof\" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br /><br />First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish. <br /><br />It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes. But, in the end, I had a pretty nice looking poly gel nail for the first time ever.<br /><br />I appreciate that the kit comes with all the necessities, aside from the slip solution. It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail form attachment things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel. You definitely get a lot for your money, and you will get a nice strong nail from this kit. I'm giving 4 stars ✨ for the lack of information on the packaging and instructions on colors and curing times. But, I really do think I will like it much better once I get the hang of it.",

But, when I do that the outer end flips up and makes the lashes look terrible. If I don't cut them, they stick into the inner corner of my eyes, causing major irritation and immediately flip up, also making them look terrible. <br />I feel like they need one more magnet on the outer end, close to the last magnet. Because, most people need to trim any and all eyelashes, in order to make them fit their eyes better. In every video I've ever watched with glue on lashes, the person always has to trim the eyelashes just a little bit shorter in width. Why didn't the manufacturers of these eyelashes think that it would not be the same for these lashes?<br /><br />I love the concept, and really wish that these worked for me, because I have very dry eyes and cannot wear eye makeup and mascara.

    "text": "I'm really on a kick of trying the whole OZ line...and I am in love with all of it. In fact, I find a way to use every serum over two days. I use Retin A every other night and use the vitamin c serum after using it. The next night, I use the Vitamin c with AHA and the Hyaluronic acid serums along with this one. I do wait about 10-15 minuites between each. But, I use the eye gel every night. They all work so well together and my skin is looking and feeling so much better. My biggest problems are large pores and uneven texture. My texture has evened out so much and my pores are surprising me more each day. I'd say these serums really have made the biggest difference in my pores. I kept seeing my grandmother's nose in the mirror, and I'm only 46--I was really self conscious. I'm starting to like looking in the mirror now...I'm seeing pretty quick changes and I like them.",

As some bloggers said, it DOES irritate eyes a little and it is extremely hard to remove. So if you want to buy this, buy oily lip/eye cleanser together. In terms of mascara, it's an excellent mascara. It does not make your lashes spidery or so, and make the lashes curly, defined and longer for a whole day. I have tried multiple mascaras from Chanel, Lancome, and many Korean brands, but I think this mascara is still the best.",

This is not a paid review and not forced to give 5 stars.<br /><br />They are identical as the official manscaped blade which is the reason I test tried them. It cuts the exact same way and pretty much identical to the original. Best part is that you get two of them.<br /><br />Generally, they recommend replacing the blades every three months, but I've used my original 1 for over six months and as long as you clean the blade, wash it, as well as removing any hairs the buildup inside the original machine or on the blade itself one should last you about the same. Considering you get two of them for $20 (at the time of writing this review 4/20/2022)  its a great deal.<br /><br />I was getting ready to shave my chest and armpits and waited for the blades to get delivered. They cut identical as the original. You can either use it as a beard/face trimmer to keep very light stubble that is under a five o'clock shadow or simply use it to cut your chest hair or under the armpit for a closer shave.",

I've pretty much been living with my hair in a braid for the last year because it is the only thing I can do that doesn't end up in a huge mess but also mostly stays-well, except for all the frizzies and flyaways that sneak out.  So I was looking for another fast alternative to get my hair back and out of my face that also wouldn't require an hour of brushing to undo.<br />These were cheap, and Amazon is always so great about returns, that I decided to give it ago.  I figured, at worse, at least it would be a simple-ish way to pull my hair back when I am working at the computer.  And they are.  20 seconds and my hair is back in a bun without the discomfort of lots of other hair styles.  I mean, they are actually surprisingly comfortable.<br />But what I did not expect is for them to hold so well!  I put my hair in a high bun yesterday then went for a run.  I had fully intended to take the bun out and put my hair in a braid, because there was no way this thing would hold through a run, but IT DID!  7 miles later, my bun was still secure and tight, but comfortable and looked as good (which honestly wasn't that good to begin with) as it did when I first put it up.  I could not believe it held through the entire run.<br />In all honesty, they are a bit fussy to use, and I have not perfected making it look like a perfect doughnut bun.  But I'm not looking for winning style awards.  I just wanted a simple way to get my hair up and back that would hold for a few hours. And in that aspect I got way more than I bargained for.<br />Very impressed, very pleased, very glad I took a chance!",

It was not too greasy like the other oil for hair growth that he used. In fact, it is a little watery and lightweight and dries out easily. I had to pour more as I apply it to the rest of his scalp unlike the products which he previously used where a tiny amount would do. As to the scent, we both like it. As for the effectiveness, I have to update on this as it has been just 4 days since he started using this to tell any difference. Also, he didn't develop any itchiness on his scalp.",

The box I received said “medium” and it works for her, though it's a little tight. There are a lot of silicone bristles inside and while that's good for cleaning, if you're on the borderline of it fitting your dog, too many bristles make it difficult to get your dog's paws in and out and to agitate the cup enough to clean. I didn't see a size noted when I ordered, so I'm not quite sure if it's possible to order different sizes since I don't see that info on the Amazon page, just on the box I received.<br />Cleaning the cup is easy - just rinse if the water isn't too dirty or unscrew the top and remove the silicone bristle insert for a deeper clean.<br />The included towel is nice and fluffy, but only the size of a standard washcloth.

    "text": "I've used a number of different salt scrubs and love them for how soft they leave my skin feeling after a shower. This one is a little chunkier than most and feels rougher on my skin. It is also quite oily. I like some oil in my scrubs for moisturizing, often I don't even need to apply lotion after using, but this one seemed extra oily and left the shower slippery. It separates, so needs to be shaken or stirred before using. It does leave my skin feeling smooth and provided you like coconut, the scent is nice.",

    "text": "I love the smell of this conditioner so was eager to try it. Unfortunately, it did almost nothing for my hair. I have thick, curly hair and require a lot of conditioner. I used the same amount of this Taza conditioner as I would any other, and it was strange in that it felt like I hadn't put anything on my hair. There was no silky feel, I could not comb my fingers through may hair. I enjoyed the scent, but my hair felt as if I hadn't put any conditioner on it. I tried adding more, but it didn't help. I ended up rinsing it and using a different conditioner. If your hair doesn't require much conditioning, this may work for you, but if your hair is anything like mine, this probably isn't for you.",

    "text": "I've been trying out a couple of different lash serums over the past month. With my husband also using it (on his brows), while I use it on my lashes, we've been able to try different brands to see if there are any differences in results. This serum, by Kimuse, is very similar to the others in consistency (a thin liquid) and in how it's applied (with a very thin brush). I have had no negative reactions to the serum, and no irritation to my eyes even when I've slipped and gotten some in my eye. This serum boasts results in as little as 3-4 weeks, while most others are more conservative at 6 weeks. In the few weeks we've been using the serums, neither of us have noticed any dramatic changes as far as lash or brow growth, but I do think I'm losing fewer lashes which is a definite plus. Honestly, I'm not sure if any serum is going to provide dramatic results, but we'll continue for at least a few more weeks and see what happens while hoping for the best.Hopefully, I'll be back with exciting news!<br /><br />Update: After using this, as well as other, lash growth serums for several months, I have noticed a definite improvement in the length of my lashes. I have not noticed as significant an improvement in the thickness, or volume, of my lashes, however. I believe that these types of serums do help promote growth, and I haven't been able to detect much difference between brands except that a couple of them irritated my eyes. Therefore, my conclusion is that this is helpful and the real determination of what works best will be what's most comfortable for you to use, so read the ingredients and watch for any possible allergy triggers or irritants.",

    "title": "Nice cream, gimmicky packaging",
    "text": "When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn't what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product…<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It's really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading “Skin Set Go.”  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don't think I'll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company's website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company's website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I'd personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It's very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it's unique, it's fun, it's memorable. However, there's a ton of plastic used that isn't necessary, and with the design, I don't know how I'll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you're looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.",

My hands needed some serious help and after using this cream for just a few days, I have seen much improvement. My skin is much soft, the cracks are disappearing, and they feel moisturized. The cream is thick, a little goes a long way, and I've found it's best to really rub it in, not list skim it over the skin and leave it. I have also been using the cream on a particularly itchy patch of skin on my back, again, with excellent results.<br />There is no scent.<br />The cream is made from several natural ingredients, most notably Manuka honey from New Zealand, something new to me, but that has been used for centuries in New Zealand. I'm glad it made its way to me in the USA!",

But it does not reduce wrinkles, eyebags, etc., which is what it claims, so I gave it 3 stars.<br />I use it in the morning and in the evening, after washing my face.<br />It feels cool when applied, and doesn't cause any irritation.  It also doesn't give me eye crusts.  There is no smell.  It doesn't have any bad interaction with my makeup either.",

Instead of streaking down my cheeks or blotching in the creases of my eyelids, it really stays on where it is supposed to, especially if I use an eyeshadow primer. The colors are lovely, neutral hues that most people will find complementary to  their skin tone. I have a couple of their eye shadow sets, but this is the one that gets used the most.<br /><br />The pink set is softly feminine with lighter colors to accent daywear.

I used the mask after taking a hot bath and washing with my regular cleanser to help open the pores, soften any blackheads, and loosen the dead skin. It works well, drying in about 20 minutes. It left my skin feeling soft. I then finished with the serum and enjoyed the selfcare it promotes. A nice addition to my routine.",

    "text": "Oh my GAWWWD! This thing is amazing! This will be a lengthy review, but if you are like me, I hope you'll enjoy the very detailed essay I am about to write for the 2nd time because my original review closed out of the page :(<br /><br />I will preface this by letting you know I have coarse, curly hair. \"bUt hEaThEr, wHat nUmBer aNd pOroSitY aRe YoU?\".<br />I am 3a-c and high porosity. Now, it is storytime LOL, so grab a snack or an adult bev.<br /><br />Let me tell you about the root, no pun intended, of a good portion of my self esteem issues LOL. When I was a kid, I was teased relentlessly about my hair. Ah yes, even Rave/LA Looks gel, with a spritz of White Rain hairspray couldn't tame this! Kids are mean. I ran cross country all through high school, and with many mornings having only an hour to get ready after running until my bunions ached (what the heck heather, TMI!), I eventually learned the only way to keep these people from throwing tiny paper balls in my hair or touching it, was to throw it in a bun. Containment, if you will. That thing was so tight I could hardly think straight. Does that explain my grades lol? So, my hair means a lot to me, y'all!<br /><br />Moving onto the stuff you really want to know, the magical brush I'm in love with💖<br /><br />This brush has what I assume are nylon bristles. The only suggestion I have is to replace them with boar bristles, but it isn't a deal breaker. A few, and I mean 2 or 3, of those bristles came out when I was examining this baby before using it. It has pins and bristles all the way around and up and down. They don't tug at the hair or stretch it to damage or snap damp hair. I did brush my hair out with a wet brush before using, though.<br /><br />The brush is so lightweight, I didn't think it was going to do much lol. Thank you to the manufacturer for making it so lightweight! It was such a breeze to brush the sections of hair. My wrists were happy :)<br /><br />The brush does get hot, but not too hot! I accidentally touched the metal part a few times and I still have all my fingers! Yeehaw! There is a little knob that sticks out, to grasp onto as you roll the brush through your hair. You could probably use a straightening glove too! I have never used a Revlon brush, nor touched one irl. So, take that for what it is, but I've watched A LOT of videos on YouTube with that specific brush. I believe the Revlon is heavier and hotter than this brush. I have heard of some gals smelling burning. I did not experience that. I did use a heat protectant (up to 450°) along with a leave in cream. By the way, there is an air (I assume cool) setting, which is amazing as it is actually regar air! Not semi warm air like some dryers I've used in the past. The low setting is low and the high is faster and hotter. They light up so you know what is what! Love it.<br /><br />Please don't expect this to smooth it out like a flat iron would. This provides the perfect base though, to smooth with a flat iron quickly. It took me from start to finish about 50 mins. Some of that time was spent sectioning and spraying the hair with protectant, as well as doing some house stuff. Realistically it maybe took 40 mins. I did wait after my wash and condition, to let the hair dry a little bit. To about 85%. I even spritzed dry sections with water as needed, so my brush could glide through. I've only used this 2x. Once on wet hair and once for a touch up. I'm hoping to be as good as Julissa Guillen on YouTube, as I use this more :) maybe I'll be faster and it'll be smoother too!<br /><br />I used this before bedtime, so I don't have a day of wear pics available for you.<br /><br />But, the second pic shows my hair wet, unbrushed.<br /><br />The third pic is right after finishing! AMAZING! I was literally in awe! Couldn't believe it. Even after cosmetology school, I couldn't master a blowout on myself *cries*<br /><br />The fourth pic is the next morning. Slept on a regular cotton pillowcase (I should get a satin one from Amazon lol). I left it down while I slept btw.<br /><br />The last pic is after a go through with the flat iron. I didn't have to section my hair for once to flat iron my hair! I just ran it through with some more heat protectant as well, a must have :D<br /><br />Besides the boar bristle suggestion, I did notice the words on the dryer are already faded. It doesn't affect the dryer, so I really don't care lol. The other thing was the twisty thing to turn the dryer on, doesn't line up directly with the lights and words (OFF, AIR, LOW, HIGH). Again, I don't care but everyone different, so I wanted to let you beautiful awesome people know!<br /><br />Overall, I am so impressed and so upset at myself for not getting one of these sooner. Can't beat the value and it comes with a warranty. Thank you HAUSBELL, I LOVE YOU!❣💞🥰💇‍♀️",

It is so cute on me, very stylish, affordable and breathable. It doesn't ever feel heavy or look awkward; I just throw it on and go. I've worn this piece to bed many times. Get up and brush out the kinks, looks good as new. For synthetic hair, this one is hard to beat. I love changing up my look so this piece will be retired in a few days, but I loved this wig so much that I wore it for two weeks in a row & I honestly can't remember the last time I did that with a synthetic piece & it STILL looks as good as it did on the first day.

Now the back part/bottom is the shiny steel...I think they should have made it textured too, to ease slipperiness! The actual clipper cutting edge is the smile shape ).  The back also has a \"keyhole\" for hanging it if you wanted.  Great little file w/nicely plumped end for ease of use.

Other brands I've used have slits in the backing material, making it much easier to dispense a patch without damaging it.<br /><br />> The packaging is very wasteful.

The packet is soft, which means it's not ideal for dispensing one wipe at a time without some measure of struggle. There's an adhesive flap to cover the opening, but again, as with pretty much any packet with this design, the flap doesn't do nearly as good of a job as a hard plastic cover.<br /><br />The wipe material is soft but pretty durable. It's designed to be a \"prep\" before using a stick-on breathing strip on your nose. As such, it doesn't do all that good of a job. While it does contain witch hazel, there's too little of it for the wipe to perform well. Witch hazel is the last ingredient (after water, glycerin, and aloe). Witch hazel is a great prep for any adhesive to ensure a good skin bond. Using these wipes is really no better for that task than plain water.<br /><br />While it is a comfortable wipe to use for general face and hand cleaning, given the price and the lack of unique benefits re: better adhesion, I see this as a 3 star (average) product at best.

The standard clipper is very nice -- solid, sharp, and well up to the task of handling fingernails and lighter toenails. The various tools are also of decent quality.<br /><br />What's not so good is the toenail clippers. It has a rather lightweight feel to it compared with other clippers I've used. The short handles make it less comfortable to use than other clippers. More importantly, the spring mechanism failed within the first couple of minutes of use. It uses two leaf style springs that push the jaws apart. The problem is with how they attach to the handle. There are two little prongs for each spring that fit into two little holes in the handle. For mine, the pins are too short to make a solid connection, so one falls (or rather, jumps) out no matter how many times I've tried to seat it properly into the handle (see photo).  It can be used without the spring, but it's quite cumbersome to do so. Given the importance of the toenail clipper to the overall usefulness of the kit, I see this as a 2 star product.<br /><br />If the springs were better it would be 4 stars since, even when properly functioning, the clippers are not as easy to use as others, but warrant 4 stars given the low cost compared with better quality clippers.",

    "text": "I'm not all that impressed with these products. Neither container lists the ingredients on the label, instead providing the ingredient list on a card that's in the box. It shows that the cleaner is a 2% salicylic acid wash, which is a pretty tried and true formulation for treating acne. It is a low-lather, but still effective cleaner, but I didn't experience any difference with this compared with other 2% salicylic cleaners that cost far less. It's a fine cleaner, but way overpriced for such a tiny (0.51 oz) container.<br /><br />The repairing night cream is a combination of retinol (0.05%), niacinamide (3%), and hyaluronic acid (2%). All are proven performers, but again, it's quite overpriced considering how low of a percentage of retinol is in the formulation. It does a decent job of moisturizing and did not cause any skin irritation. I am a fan of retinol, but the concentration in this cream (0.05%) is well below what I usually use (either 0.1% or 0.5%).<br /><br />While this product combo is on the right track, the value is just not there considering the amount in the container (one-half an ounce for each). While I would certainly recommend a salicylic acid wash and a retinol-based cream, there are many other options that provide these options at a far lower cost. Four stars for performance; 1 star for value; overall rating of 2.5 stars.",

The included caps (2 were provided) are of excellent quality, with polycone inserts to maintain an air-tight, leak proof seal. The included sprayers (2 were provided) are functional, but rather cheap in terms of build quality, especially the trigger. It also comes with a tiny little funnel that is way undersized and pretty useless given the bottle volume, and a few black labels (which require a white pen, which is NOT included).<br /><br />Each bottle comes in a bubble pack sleeve, but the box itself is rather thin with limited protection. These are a notch below other bottles I've received when it comes to manufacturer-provided protective packing. Still, the bottles did not break or chip in transit.<br /><br />The bottles needed a good wash before use since the outside had some type of greasy-feeling film. I would have washed them regardless of their condition, but these definitely needed a good washing before use.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration I'll rate these as 4 stars. Well worth considering if you need a more colorful option than amber and don't expect to be using the sprayer much (or at all).",

Normally I prefer unscented (or something that just smells soapy) but this light scent is quite enjoyable. It's a thick cream that resembles a moisturizer more so than a soap.<br /><br />There's virtually no lather to it. It foams up a bit, but very lightly. It's a very gentle soap but, for me, it's a bit too gentle in that I don't have a clean feeling after using it. My face feels more like I've applied a moisturizer. That's not a bad thing, especially in the dry winter months, but I want to have a clean-feeling face after using a face soap, and I don't get it from this.<br /><br />Balancing the positive and negative features puts my rating at three stars (average). It smell great and it is very gentle, but it's not a face soap I'd get again. There are other gentle soaps that also offer better cleaning and a better value on a cost per ounce basis.",

    "text": "I'm impressed with this face soap. It's very thick and silky, and only a very small amount is needed to get good results. That's especially welcome to find out given the price for a pretty small bottle.  It lathers up well and does a good job of cleaning without leaving my skin overly dry. It is a bit more intensive than other face soaps, so my face does feel a little 'tight' after using it. However, it's not excessive, and well worth it given how well this soap cleans if you have an oily complexation. The charcoal makes the soap dark, but it's not as jet-black as other charcoal soaps I've used. It's more of a deep gray.<br /><br />The scent is also quite nice. It's a medium/light intensity and has sort of an after-shave smell to it. The scent does not linger much at all after rinsing. While I tend to prefer unscented soaps, this scent is pleasant and enjoyable.<br /><br />The only con is the bottle. Getting the pump nozzle to pop up was a chore since the retaining ring the pump head screws into also rotates, making it a struggle to get the nozzle to pop up. I eventually got it working, but have noticed that the pump leaks at the stem. It's a small leak, but it adds up over a few days to make a mess on the bottle and waste soap.  Given the price, the pump mechanism should have been of better quality.<br /><br />One star down for the bottle issues, but otherwise, it's a very enjoyable soap to use.",

However, the shave quality is the same – OK, but not a standout.<br /><br />The case feels more solid than the LifeProof and, while it's more of a traditional look, I think they did a nice job with the overall aesthetics. It is pretty grippy even with wet hands. It does not, however, feel as comfortable to hold as the more sculpted models such as most of the Panasonic shavers and some Braun shavers.<br /><br />The shave quality of this model is identical to that of the LifeProof: very Remington in how it feels (close, but rather aggressive). Performance is best on the easy spots (cheek) but not as good on the more trickier spots (neck and jawline). The flex head helps with dealing with face contours but it lacks enough travel to do an excellent quality job.<br /><br />The aggressiveness of the shave is dialed down when using it wet. It needs a very, very thin layer of shave cream (the gel style creams work well) or the head gets bogged down.<br /><br />Love the trimmer! The positioning could be improved to make it easier to use, but it cuts very cleanly on sideburns and ‘shash trimming.<br /><br />The controls are clean, easy to read and tell you all you need to know (charge and battery status).<br /><br />I like the feel of this better than the Wahl LifeProof, but the shave quality keeps this at the same rating (average, which is 3 stars).

I've tried all sorts of moisturizers without much success. The best results (if you can call it that) have been from using petroleum jelly, but that's messy and it still doesn't work well.<br /><br />This argan oil, however, has been hugely effective. It gave me results right from the first day, and over the course of just a few days I can see noticeable healing of the skin cracks. No more pain and my hands feel far better than any other treatment I've tried.<br /><br />The product comes very nicely packaged, with a nice box filled with shredded packing material to keep the glass bottle safe in transit. It also makes for a very nice presentation should you want to give this as a gift. The bottle comes with a dropper and a “spritz” head. The latter is my only quibble – the spray head didn't work well at all, and made sort of a mess when using it to dispense the oil. I replaced it with the dropper and had much better results.<br /><br />The oil itself has little or no scent. You need very, very little for results – I use about 1-2 small drops per hand, and that's more than enough. It spreads easily (as expected given that it's oil). It does take a few minutes to soak in – my hands are very greasy when I first apply it, but after a few minutes the greasiness goes away. The sheen from the oil stays around longer, but that too dissipates after 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />This can be used for a wide range of applications including face, body and even hair. It comes with a good amount of information to help explain how/where to use it, and how the oil was processed.<br /><br />I'm very impressed with this oil – it's the only product I've ever tried that totally worked to solve my dry/cracked hands. It's not cheap, but well worth the price if you need a highly effective moisturizer. Highly recommend.<br />[Sample provided for review]",

This accomplishes that goal with an plastic insert in the middle that helps direct the toothpaste between your teeth.<br /><br />I use both the Sonicare (Healthy White) and the Oral B 5000. Both have their pluses and minuses, so switching between the two gives me the best of both worlds.<br /><br />The Oral-B arrangement of paddles does a better job in getting at the gum line without discomfort. The Sonicare Hydroclean's bristles are stiffer and I find that they irritate my gums when used several times in a row.<br /><br />But, the Sonicare does a better job in cleaning stains between teeth. I'm a tea drinker and getting the stains out between my front teeth has always been a chore. The Hydroclean works very well - noticeable improvement over the Sonicare ProResults and the Oral-B.<br /><br />These only come in the standard size. The ProResults has a smaller version that is great for getting at the tight spots. But, I assume that a smaller version of this would not function well since the plastic insert would have to be very small.<br /><br />If you're a ProResults user these are well worth trying out. If you have tender gums you may want to alternate between the HydroClean and the ProResults (or, as I do, with the Oral-B. The Oral-B also makes a super soft brush if you have very sensitive gums. Hard to find, but works very well).<br /><br />Keep in mind that nothing takes the place of flossing. No matter what you use, you still need to break out the floss to keep your teeth healthy!",

I like that one serving delivers 10 mg of collagen but it's only one type - bovine collagen.  I think it's kind of pricey coming in at $34.95 (as of this review) since I've reviewed collagen powders that contains several types of collagen and were more than 9.3 oz for as much or even less money.  Also, you won't see any results in 2 weeks so don't let those reviews get you all excited.  I've been consuming collagen on a daily basis for about a year and am now just beginning to see some positive changes in my skin and nails.  I'm 63 and realize all the collagen supplements in the world won't make me look 40 again but I have seen some improvements in less crinkly skin on my arms and some fine lines around my eyes looking much smoother.

This brush is really good, though I would have liked for the bristles pegs to be a little longer.  I find I have to push the brush down harder to get to my scalp.  I have another bamboo brush with longer bristles that I like best but this one is still a very good brush especially if you have short hair.

Your skin must be clean, dry and free of any moisturizers.  They stick well to my skin and definitely pulls it up some.  However, the skin that's pulled up gets crinkled up and if your hair doesn't cover it, the crinkles will show.  The tapes are really hard to see once applied, and easy to apply once you get the hang of it.  I blew through at least 10 just trying to figure it out but you get 40 in a box.

This software suite is perfect for the small business with big goals and the features assure you can accurately assess where you are with your finances as you meet them. My brother is a real estate agent and while there are other industry-specific programs for that, he is really enjoying this QuickBooks so far because it allows him to track his expenses, listings aka inventory, commissions and taxes that must be precise with each transaction. Secure import of financials was a relief, and he was set up in about an hour or two and learning his way around the program with relative ease. He also has an assistant that he was able to easily add to the payroll and able to do so without the free support!<br /><br />Considering the list price on this new 2019 edition of Quickbooks is close to $500, the current offering is a steal and I recommend jumping on it before the price goes up again, as these sorts of offerings tend to fluctuate. QuickBooks is the most popular and affordable software compared to others on the market, and you do get what you pay for, so the value here is terrific too. I just began using the regular 2019 since I am on a smaller scale and this version is new to him, so I can't comment on the issues others are having.

    "text": "This is a handy set of stainless podiatrist style nail trimmers and tools that come in a zippered storage case, making it convenient for travel or storage.<br /><br />The set includes one curved clipper, one angled one, a lifter for ingrown nails, a pusher for cuticle care, and two different files for smooth finishing.  The angled main clipper has a non-adjustable internal tension spring and a coated ergonomic shaped hand grip, while the other clipper has a coated non-ergonomic shaped grip.<br /><br />When trying to cut through tough thick nails you need a sure grip. Unfortunately, the grip coating material used on these clippers is hard and not padded, therefore failing to provide cushioning to users with arthritis or to provide a non-slip grip.<br /><br />I tried these clippers on my father's thick toenails, and they do cut, but not as sharply or precisely as the professional grade clippers I usually use on his nails.  Instead of one clean cut, it took several clips to get through his tough nails with these and because of that the finish was jagged and needed filing to smooth out.<br /><br />Though I wouldn't recommend this set for seniors, I do think the curved shape of the larger clipper is a nice touch though, so they're useful enough for regular nails and handy to pack if you're planning a trip.",

It left my skin feeling much softer, less irritated, soothed. It is something I plan to keep on hand.",

I fine even the Merkur 34C a little too aggressive for my skin. The Merkur Futur is horrible for me and is a paperweight for anyone who prefers mild razors. The iKon B1 slant is a perfect balance. Not too aggressive, and with a light touch it gave me a very smooth shave. I normally do 3 passes and then touch up areas that need it. I had 5 days growth when I shaved with this razor head today. I was amazed when I finished my first pass. It looked like I had done two passes with my other razors. I normally do with the grain, cross-grain, and then lightly against the grain.<br />With the B1 I did a with-the-grain pass and one very light across-the-grain pass and it looked like I was done shaving. I did a touch-up in one or two spots and I called it good. An against the grain pass would have left me absolutely BBS but that usually gives me ingrown hairs. Oh, by the way, no nicks, weepers, or irritation at all. The head is shaped very weird with the slant design but I was able to shave under my nostrils with ease; much better than most, actually! I really am impressed with this head.<br />I can't wait to do another shave tomorrow.<br />My shave:<br />iKon B1 head<br />iKon OSS handle from my 101<br />Persona Lab Blue blade (2nd shave on the blade)<br />Stirling Soap Co.

This coral colored scallop design is beautiful, and the barrette hold a lot of hair.  This is definitely for thick hair.

    "text": "After trying out a Philips (Norelco) 7120 to see if I could escape the wet razor trap I was ready for the next step; that model worked fine, except that by design the battery doesn't last that long and I could seldom get an acceptable shave around the neck. The 1050x solves both problems, I can shave in less time (must be the blades it uses) and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).<br /><br />It comes with a travel \"sarcophagus\" (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done quickly and easily enough.<br /><br />The only negatives are that it's quite a bit noisier than the 7120, but then again that is quite quiet... I still cannot get the best shave over the area between my mouth and my chin... But then again we all different facial features... And it's pricey... I'm still kicking myself for not buying this when it came out as a special deal... But I needed it too much to wait for another one to show up.",

    "text": "Update 20/02/10<br /><br />After a year and a half of good service my HQ7140 would not start even with the cord plugged in, unless I left it connected for a couple of hours...Obviously not an option when you're trying to get to work. I was about to order another one, already cursing for having to go back to blades even if only temporarily; but before that I took it to a specialized shop; they opened it and showed me it was wet on the inside and told me the \"circuit\" was fried. I explained that I had followed the manual to the letter, cleaning the shaving heads and the hair chamber with hot running water. They suggested taking the shaving unit off when I rinse it, use only warm (not hot) water, and *not* cleaning the hair chamber with water... They essentially sold me a brand new Philips HQ7120 as a replacement to use with my existing shaving unit for a reasonable price; it looks exactly the same except it has a \"Low\" red light.<br /><br />The interesting bit is that I had gone to them about a month ago to buy a new shaving unit and they told me the HQ9 heads would work fine with these models, not just the HQ8; the HQ9 feel even better, so much so that I would definitely buy the 8xxx series which use the HQ9... It was only when the 7140 failed that I realized just how much I depend on it and how well it has worked out - my technique still needs to improve and shaving still seems to take too long but no going back to blades for me!<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />As a wet shaving refugee I didn't know what to expect; I was just tired of getting cuts everyday, and paying an exhuberant tax to the wet shaver companies; I didn't want to buy a top of the line model in case things didn't work out.<br /><br />This has been a very pleasant surprise, as I'm getting close shaves with less fuss and no irritation; I beginning to get the hang of this and even the neck area is doing well.<br /><br />The battery's first run lasted for 4 days, but I may be taking a lot longer than normal while I learn. The battery light starts blinking when it's fuly charged, by the way.<br /><br />I have the Philips branded verion of this and it still says Made in Holland...",

You get 3+ pieces to make the weight,  packed in a box. So all in all a good deal if this method works for you!

    "text": "Got this kit on sale for under $20, which is an absolute steal! I guess TOBS discontinued the scent, so the supplier was clearing out inventory.<br /><br />It's a cologne-type scent with a modern vibe. The shave cream performs like other TOBS shave creams, which is a good thing. Easy to build a lather, reasonably slick and protective. The cream is harder than other TOBS creams I've used, but that doesn't affect performance in the least.<br /><br />The kit also comes with a badger brush and a cologne. The brush is actually pretty good! It's black badger hair, so the bristles are relatively stiff/scritchy, but I prefer that. Had the typical badger funk for the first few shaves, but now it's neutral. No lost bristles yet, so it seems like a quality brush/knot.<br /><br />The cologne is also nice, a matching scent to the shave cream. I find that it lasts 2-3 hours on my skin. It's a good office/professional scent: pleasant, inoffensive. Probably not going to turn any heads.<br /><br />No matter how you slice it, $20 for this kit is a great value!",
