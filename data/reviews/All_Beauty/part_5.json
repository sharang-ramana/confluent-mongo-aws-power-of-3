You can view the image you picked up from all sides. Top, side, bottom. I love that I can see the image and where I will be stamping it before stamping my finger. (I had a Konad stamper before which is not clear or jelly so you have to remember where you picked up the image or you miss where you want to put it). I only have Pueen nail plates so this stamper was used with Pueen nail plates.<br />If you have not used a stamper and nail plates before, please look up instructions such as on Youtube. My tips are to ensure the stamper and nail plate are 100% clean without polish on them each time you stamp. I will post a photo as soon as I learn how to on Amazon mobile.",

I mixed it up hoping to make it better but nope, this is definitely a fake. It also gives me a little stinging/hot sensation, like an allergic reaction. Unfortunately, I just started college & no longer have the money to drop at Sephora for the real thing so I guess I'm stuck with this for now & have to cross my fingers & pray it doesn't give me cancer or skin problems from bad ingredients.

    "text": "We love coffee in our house so when I was presented with the opportunity to try these coffee drop candies in a tin I couldn't pass them up. You get 3 cute little tins full of the candies and each had a freshness seal around them. The tin was easy to open, there were no sugar pieces from the coating that fell out, and each tin had 21 pieces in them. I found the size of the coffee drops to be quite adequate, not too small and not too big. I saw where a couple people thought they were huge but they're about the size of a jelly bean but not as fat. They have a smooth coffee flavor with some sugar added in to make them the perfect little sweet. I found them to be very tasty and enjoyable. One candy at a time is plenty for a treat. They arrived in a cute black box that makes them perfect for gift giving and the tins are the perfect size to put in your purse, pocket, desk drawer, end table or pretty much anywhere else that you want to tuck away some coffee sweetness. We thought these were so good that we're going to try one of Cavendish & Harvey's variety packs next.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. However, that doesn't mean that I just automatically gave it a high rating and made up a review. All statements made are based upon my experience with the product as I always use each product for a period of time prior to leaving my comments in order to assist future purchasers.",

The buttons are so slight that you don't even know you've turned it off or changed the temperature. Very annoying.<br />2. The iron pulls on my hair, I don't have damaged hair so it's not because of that. My other iron doesn't pull on it and I think I may go back to my old iron soon because of this problem.<br />3. And this isn't a big deal, but the hair clips that come with it are terrible and useless. Very cheap and don't hold the hair very well at all. So don't count on using them is what I am saying lol!",

We bought two different bars of Garnier. The scent was lovely, and the lather exceeded my expectations. My husband said he rather use a shampoo bar from now on. The only thing was the length of time it lasts. It is supposed to last a lot longer than it actually does. For a trip it would be great for a week. If two people are using it, that would be all it would last. We are now into week two of just my husband using it and it is just pieces. Would I buy it again for a trip? Yes.

The box has 5 words: \"rinse after 5-10 minutes.\"  I left the product in my hair for 20 minutes 'cause I didn't SEE the instructions until later (in tiny print).<br />Just use it and see and FEEL the difference in your hair.

I have to agree with other reviewers in that the instructions and English was an atrocious and I assumed the product would be as well. After all, a person would think that with such carelessness in the description of the product, that the product itself would be inferior. Oh, how wrong I was! I have highlighted hair that has also been damaged by a flat iron. I have been wanting to grow my hair out some but with the damage I was doing to my hair, each time I went for a ‚Äútrim‚Äù, my hair dresser would have to cut off too much damaged ends. So, I quit using a flat iron and started using better products on my hair. When I got the opportunity to review this item, I was excited to give it a try and see if it would help. What I found was simply amazing. My hair now feels thick and bouncy and I can't believe how much easier it is to style. My hair is very fine so the additions of hair products usually just weighs my hair down, but this product does not. I can't wait until my next trim with my hair dresser and see if she notices a difference‚Ä¶I certainly did. I did receive this item at a discount for an honest and unbiased review and I am grateful for that opportunity.",

This pink train case is all and more than I expected and I am beyond thrilled to own this now. In the past I have thrown all my makeup in a zippered travel case and then had to try and sift through the items inside to locate what I was looking for. Sometimes I would just dump the contents out because it was such a struggle. With this pink beauty, all my items can be nicely organized and will stay right when I put them. When closed up, nothing is going to move around and when opened up, everything is right within easy reach and easy to find. This has a large mirror which was a great surprise to me that sits at a perfect height and angle when putting on my makeup. I have struggled for some time to find a way to use a hand held make up mirror while trying to put on my makeup while traveling.  I also really appreciated that the top two sections have plastic on the bottom of the tray. We all know that makeup can get messy if spilled and this will allow for easy clean-up if such a thing should ever happen. The case itself is a nice shade of pink and the quality of workmanship is awesome. I could tell by just picking the case up how strong and sturdy that it was. I am so excited to have this case and I am extremely grateful that I was given the opportunity to purchase this at a discount for an honest, unbiased review.",

I guess you may not control these things - such as availability and pricing, but I will lease this message for YOU and for the vendor because when this happens I will NOT be a return customer.  This is so discouraging, and it's like I am sorry but if you want return customers then stick to what the product is worth.  it's a very very tiny tube! so at seven dollars, okay, but now immediately you increase by two dollars, I just WILL NOT buy from you.<br />please at least create a system for return purchasers... I just bought this month, just received last week and you have UPPed the price by $2!  geesh!!! plus it says that I purchased three times including this one last week.",

These lashes are so freakin easy and if I don't get them on perfect the first time it's ok because I can just try again. I like the three different sizes that come in the kit because I like shorter thicker lashes for every day and long lashes for special events and pictures. It took me less than 5 minutes to completely apply these. Make sure you apply the liner, let it set 15 to 20 seconds and then reapply. I let my lines dry for a whole minute before putting the lashes on so that there is no chance of getting goop on my lashes. All in all I will be purchasing these on a regular basis for sure!",

It can go on blotchy if it is not applied evenly. Some parts of the body might become darker or not absorb this as well. Making it appear smooth is a challenge. Also, where do you stop applying this to your body? Wherever you stop there will be a contrast with the untanned skin. One particular problem is your hairline and scalp. I have thinning hair, so the contrast between a pale scalp and a tanned face looks odd. This is a challenging product to use and I wouldn't recommend it unless you are already used to using sunless tanners.<br /><br />It is not greasy, it did not stain, and it dried quickly.

Because, however, I've already bought these and they may have some beneficial effects the regular heads lack, I've chosen to alternate the heads.  I use one head to clean my teeth with baking soda, then floss, then use the other head to brush with toothpaste.<br /><br />I've now been using this head for two months.  It only took a couple of days to get used to the stiffness and I wouldn't even notice it if I wasn't alternating the heads.  I see no evidence, however, that it cleans any better.",

I bought two types, these and rhinestone Bobby pin style.<br /><br />These by far slid right into place while the others were very beautiful they were hard to place in hair without flattening the area.<br />These are easy to bend in direction you might desire.<br />I'd say I would give 5 stars if it was brighter Glistening rhinestones. I was happy with the fast delivery!!  Thank you Covid wedding mother of the bride!!",

I usually struggle with breakouts and sensitive skin and have to be mindful about the products I use. I am happy to report, the Etude House Moistfull Collagen Skin Care Set has been kind to my skin. More specifically, after using it for about a week, I started to notice changes in my skin: my blemishes have cleared up, my pores are smaller, and my skin feels softer and more refreshed. With regard to the products themselves, they smell pleasantly, absorb well into the skin, and don't leave any oily or sticky residue behind. Unlike other products, very little of the products is needed to sufficiently cover the entire face.",

Nail polish helps me take better care once in awhile, but that only lasts a day or so.

I don't feel bad about changing them out after awhile and trying a new set.  The adhesive glue on the back is flexible, but holds super well!!  I love how even once they are old, they don't just pop off!<br />I have pretty narrow nails, so I need to file down the sides on some of them before applying, but you definitely want them to fit right otherwise they won't stay on as long.  If they are too wide, the edge will left up eventually.  Otherwise, these will last two weeks easy!<br />I think they're adorable, and got major compliments on them.  People are always amazed when I tell them they're press-on.  :)",

After the 4th use it appears all the bristles have already fallen out of one hole, and many other spaces are losing the bristles fast.

It's super comfortable to hold and has just enough weight to it to feel balanced without tiring your hand. The cord isn't super long but there's enough length to give you some freedom of movement. I do recommend starting on the slowest setting until you're comfortable using this because you could easily damage your nail bed if you aren't careful.

It's a nice box, again, offers a good number of items for a gift, and is done nicely enough in box set up and presentation it would be well received. Second, the items in it are a good range of ‚Äúquality‚Äù so I think it'll be appreciated. What I am saying: the brush, comb, bag, scissors, and guard are decent, but not great quality. You can get better quality, but for working needs and for a gift, this is pretty good. But, for example the scissors feel a bit cheaper. But they will get use as long as they cut well enough. I'm not big into using a guard, but this one is like others I've had. The included bag is decent, but I'd never use it; if traveling or moving my stuff I'd use a toiletry bag. The brush is not as nice as others I have, but it's useable and gets the job done. Same with the comb. That brings us to the shampoo, Conditioner, and oil. NOTE: I have extremely sensitive skin, so this review is based on my experience from that standpoint. I like a range of scents or items to keep my beard in good shape, but I have a far more difficult time finding things that work and are okay on my skin. I have only used these items once, but that's all it takes to know. I come away happy - they all worked and NO reaction. I used the shampoo and conditioner in the shower today and they not only had a nice, light scent, but I was bale to let it sit on the beard for a few minutes each, having no issues with skin and liking the smell. The beard felt soft following and I liked how they worked overall. Next, the oil. I believe it is claimed to be used for ‚Äúbeard growth,‚Äù and maybe it'll help with that. My beard is decent, but I do have spots that could use thickening, so again, I keep an eye open for options. However, there is no way to know if it'll work for that for a few weeks if not months. So until then, it again did fine on my skin - not a single ounce of negative reaction. The sect is light, so it's nice to smell, but one (my wife) has to get up close to smell it. I do like it that way, so it doesn't bug my sinuses or overwhelm. In the end I'm very happy so far with this Beard Growth Kit, 10 In 1 Beard Kit For Men with Beard Oil, Beard Balm, Beard Conditioner set and happy I grabbed it. I'll use it and if all stays well, would consider getting it again.",

    "text": "First off, I have extremely sensitive skin overall, but especially on my face. To that end, I must be very carefully about what I put on. I do tend towards lighter or no scents, but have found some that work alright for me. But with or without scent, I can still have issues. In the end, it's how my skin handles anything that is the bottom line for me. In this case, this Provence Beauty Beard Oil - All Natural Fragrance Free Olive, Sunflower & Jojoba Oils works well for me and so far, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />I use a derma roller a couple times a week to help with hair in my beard and front of my head. At this point I then add a beard oil to these locations to help stimulate growth. Without doing major testing with all the elements, like a control group (area) of my head, it's hard to say what works and what doesn't. I feel like the derma roller has a large part in how well growth or at least slowing of loss goes. But, I have also come to believe some of these oils available do play a supportive role. To that point, I won't be able to speak about this Provence Beauty Beard Oil - All Natural Fragrance Free Olive, Sunflower & Jojoba Oils  for awhile. I have only just begun to use it - as a replacement for another oil.<br /><br />But I do like that 1. it's not too oily on my hair or skin, 2. has little to no real scent, 3. feels fine and is not a problem on my skin, and 4. that it washes off my hands easily post application. Right now I like it as an oil providing at least some softening to my beard. Will it aide growth? We shall see...",

    "text": "I will fully admit up front, I have a very bad sensitivity to scents. In my years of life I've only found maybe half a dozen I can put up with. I usually avoid them - but because I enjoy them - I do try to find ways to use it. Because of these sensitivities I try not to ‚Äúblame‚Äù the product, unless it burns - then I have to question what all is in there. In this case, I decided to try Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine because of other reviews - I was hoping... but sadly, nope, I can't do it. So I'm giving it 4 stars 1. because I do like the smell, but 2. it lasts far too long, smelled like it got stronger than lighter, and in the end, was too much for me. I got the Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine and both my wife and I liked the smell, but immediately worried it would be too much based on first sniffs. I put it on, and it worked great. It's easy to put on - only a small amount covered my hair easily - and smelled nice. It was easy to work with my hair and it looked great. But as time went on, this Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty started to smell more and more and more. The smell did not dissipate, but grew. And my head started to really hurt.<br />In the end, I do like this Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine for how it works and how it looks. But for sensitive guys, you need to be aware, this putty has a strong scent - in my case at least, too strong. I won't be able to keep using it.",

    "text": "I drive my wife nuts when I trim my beard in the bathroom - I try to catch all the clippings, but without something like this, it does not work well. I thought I‚Äùd give this a try - it seems like a great idea, but...<br /><br />1. It arrived with 1 plastic bib, 2 suction cups with hooks, and 1 shaving cream brush.<br />2. The plastic bib feels okay - it's a thin plastic, but it should last for a decent amount of time. It is not as nice as most of the kinds I've experienced or we own for haircutting<br />3. Its stitching is okay - I think it'll last decently<br />4. There are two loops on the ends you will attach to the suction cups.<br />5. The suction cups - are worthless. This is why it gets the 4 stars - I would have given it 3 stars if we didn't have our own suction cups to use instead of theirs. One of the two that came with it stuck for 5 - 10 seconds before it stopped working altogether. The other suction cup doesn't even look right - it looks like it never worked and was not made properly.<br />6. We have suction cups (bought on Amazon) we were able to use - I looped that part of the bib onto them, which worked, but not designed for this, they would fall off. I'll end up taping them to it - at least that way I'll be able to use it.<br />7. It fit me fine. It felt fine - just like a haircut cape. The white looks weird - I'm used to the far more common black - but at the same time I think it'll show the beard hair really well.<br />8. I did notice that as I go in closer to the mirror to see what I'm doing it folds over in front of me and isn't as trapped out - be aware of this because it's easy to start missing the catch in the bib.<br /><br />Overall it's a decent thing to have and it'll make my wife happy not getting the beard clippings all over the place. This could be a little nicer -  a little thicker plastic, much better suction cups - which would easily earn it a 5 star rating. But for what it is, I'm happy to have it. If it lasts, it'll be great.",

    "text": "The package contained 3 microfiber Towel Wrap Turbans: one pink, one lavender, and one striped (orange, pink, blue, white). They are 26\" in length. After a shower, I've wanted to wrap my long hair up in a towel for a while because otherwise it drips down my back as it dries. But I've never mastered getting a towel to stay in place. This product does help: place the large \"hood\" section in place on your head, tuck your hair into the tail then twist the tail one or two times, and secure the elastic loop over the button. It stays in place okay as long as you don't try to pull a shirt on over it (or similar activity). I put it on for about 20 minutes after my shower, and the Wrap is pretty wet when I take it off. My hair's still damp, but it dries much faster after that and doesn't drip down my back. So it works.",

It only takes a teaspoon in the recipe and the other thing about glycerin is that it is sweet, so it blends in well with an ice cream recipe.  My ice cream turned out great and it is smooth and creamy after being in the freezer.  Now, this is not my first use of glycerin as I have used a small amount in water to spray in my hair.  Especially on really humid days when my naturally curly hair turns into a frizz-ball, spraying my hair with a 10 parts water, 1 part glycerin (or even less glycerin, depending) keeps my hair from frizzing out so bad.

Life has changed and finding the best way to work with the new normal is the only way to go...and this headband is working for me - maybe it will work to make it easier for others!",

Oh, and don't even get me started on humid/rainy days.  Curly hair, especially baby-fine curly hair, frizzes like crazy in humidity.  So yeah, I could spray the crap out of my hair with hairspray and have one great helmet head with not a hair out of place, but I absolutely hate hairspray.  Besides, that would require washing my hair every time I coat it with hairspray - the problem is baby-fine, dry hair isn't made to be washed daily.  So...I have lived with all those crazy \"free-wheeling\" hairs until trying this product.  It worked so well I was amazed and it did not leave my hair feeling like a hair helmet!  I used the mascara-like wand around the hairline from one ear to the other and those little hairs stayed in place!  Cool beans!  I will buy this again, definitely.",

I watched a couple and have been trying this now for the past several weeks. I must have tried close to 40 different soaps, creams and sticks from the most expensive to the not so expensive. This one is right up there in terms of face glide and lubrication.Certainly in the top quintile. Why 4 stars? I have tried every variation to get a lather but there is no getting around that this is the most difficult soap I have ever tried. Too much water, too little water it seemed impossible to get it right the first time. No matter what I tried it seemed to either be too foamy and thin or not enough water to generate a lather. It's as if the gremlin in the soap puck was contrary enough to defeat whatever I tried until the 2nd or 3rd try.<br />Bottom lime- With effort and persistence it gets the job done and the fragrance is mildly pleasant but it will never be my \"go-to\" product. I'll stick with may favs: Kiss My Face, Cella and Proraso cream.<br />UPDATE:<br />Gave it another try with a little more patience. It seems that the end product you want is a little on the thick creamy side and not really a \"lather\". If you wet your brush, turn it over and let all the water drip out that you can,then you apply brush to soap and be patient and determined you will get the thick rich cream that will do the trick. One other tip I found after you apply the cream to the face let it sit for about 20-30 seconds before you apply your razor. You will then get the greatest glide you will experience. Accordingly I have moved it up the top tier and displaced the Proraso cream.I would give it 4 1/2 stars, and not 5, if I could because of the difficult lathering.<br />FURTHER UPDATE<br />After using this puppy for a little while I have come to master it and love it. Great for glide and closeness and absence of irritation. I originally rated it a 4 but now after careful consideration I must admit that it deserves a 5 star rating. Its among my top 3 favorite shaving products.",

I actually prefer these two items more than the tube of primer itself, although it is good too. The two liquid products go on so thin and seamlessly, that it's the perfect amount of primer to smooth everything out and help the foundation last. Sometimes full-on primers can be a bit too smoothing and it makes me feel like my makeup is going to slide off. Everything is very mildly scented (a mix of fresh & floral), but not overwhelming and the scent doesn't stick around. The No Pore-Blem primer is nice and works well to smooth out specific zones on my face, but I don't use it all the time. For all over coverage, I prefer the Priming Water, followed by the Prime Essence, which makes my skin look and feel great, and helps my foundation look awesome.",

I originally purchased the purple case, and this was my comment at the time:<br /><br />\"I was really happy with the color and quality of the case, but every time I slide my new HP Elitepad into the case, it turns off.  If I pull the tablet out an inch, it turns back on.  But, it will not stay on if it is fully in the case.  Disappointing.\"<br /><br />Someone from the selling company contacted me after posting this, and replaced it with a duplicate black case that does not have this same issue and works great.  I was really impressed that they went out of their way to resolve the issue.  I just figured I was out of my money and the case would go into the trash.  I'm upgrading the review from 1 star to 4 stars just because their customer service surprised me (pleasantly) so much!",

    "text": "My husband and I are getting ready to take a trip abroad. I was worried about what I would use on my hair, because it has a mind of its own. He surprised me and bought me this flat iron for our trip since it is dual voltage. I have thin hair, but I have a lot of hair and with this having temperatures from 230 to 450 degrees I usually only have to set it at 350 for my type of hair to get it straight. It have a very nice LCD display that is very easy to read. This is a 1 inch ceramic tourmaline flat iron. It worked great in my hair making it very soft, shiny and smooth and it was done very quickly. I also like that it has an auto shut off, since I can easily get distracted. It comes with a very pretty satin drawstring bag, that will be great for putting it in my luggage.",

    "text": "I have very dull and lifeless hair, I think it is from too much sun and abuse growing up My hair is light weight but very frizzy so I have to use straighteners or curling irons to have it look decent. This has definitely made my hair shiny and looking great. I just sprayed it on damp hair, I combed it through and then I used a flat iron and I have also used it with the curling iron and I loved the outcome. My hair definitely had alot more life to it. I think if your hair looks good you feel good about yourself. The smell of this spray is amazing, it is like a fresh melon scent. It is super easy to use and I love that it gives my hair a layer of protection from the heated hair appliances and the sun. It is for all hair types and it is very light weight.",

Even when I use hair spray, to even get it to hold I have to use alot of hairspray and then my hair feels so stiff and gross looking. This hair spray held my hair all day long and my hair was not at all stiff or hard or sticky, it was very free flowing. I absolutely love the smell of this hair spray. You adjust the spray flow on the nozzle. So depending on how I want my hair to be for the day is whether I use  the light, the medium or the high spray.",

On my hair which is 4 inches long all the way around i would def need a second pack to make them look anywhere close to real hair. soooo... i added them to an existing hair piece for now till i can order in another set. on a brighter note they are def worth the $$ if you are not looking to fill a whole head!! Quality of the hair is good, and there was minimal shedding.",

I think the plastic brushes are rough on my hair & pull some hair out.<br />  So far, I'm loving this brush.  It really smooths & tames my hair down  If you want a natural soft brush, this is the one for you.  I don't use this brush on wet hair.  I switched over to a wide tooth comb.

I can't believe how much dead skin comes off while you are &#34;sanding&#34; your feet!  It is amazing!<br />  No amount of foot scrubs or using the little egg with blades could do better.  This Callus Remover is so easy to use.  When I am finished using this remover, I admire & touch my feet - then I put lotion or vaseline on & then some white socks.  I wear the socks overnight.  In the morning, my feet are so soft & free of dead skin & any beginnings of calluses.  Easy!  I don't use the remover every night, just maybe once or twice a week.  Maybe, skip a week.  So it doesn't feel like just another chore.<br />  This Callus Remover comes nicely packaged & you get a cleaning brush & 2 rollers.  I just wish I knew where I could get some extra rollers.  I feel the machine itself might outlast the 2 rollers.  If I find some rollers that fit - I'll update my review.<br />  I did receive my remover for a reduced cost for an honest opinion.

    "text": "I have the updated version of this.  It's the Braun Silk Epil 9 SkinSpa.  I think the technology has improved, as I find it much easier to remove all hair in the area.  I mainly use this on my legs and underarms.  I had the basic Silk epil 7 with the smaller head and felt like I needed to go over an area several times, which worried me - was I creating too much friction.  With the larger head and cleaner removal, I think that concern may be gone.  I also store the newer version in my shower, as I really like the body brush.",

This is especially helpful with make up items, which can leave a mess.<br /><br />The next two pieces both can fit perfectly on top of the organizer. It has an indent on the top that keeps the other organizers from sliding around.<br />One has a curved area and the other has small box like shapes.

I use essential oils so this one looked especially good to me. There are no funky ingredients or chemicals in it, so that was a huge plus for me. Each of the bath bombs has a name and what it is for. My favorite right off the bat was the grapefruit for energy. I was having a tired day and needed a pick me up, so I took a hot bath with one.<br /><br />The bath bomb took a while to dissolve, so it lasted quite a while, then the water turned lightly colored. It was nice to feel on my toes as it dissolved. The smell was lovely, however it didn't last too long. On the next one I used I just dropped a few drops of essential oils that matched the scent, so it helped it stay scented longer.<br /><br />All in all it is a lovely luxury to pamper yourself or give as a gift.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

    "text": "Scrubs are a nice way to get rid of dead skin, so this seemed like a good way to go. It isn't full of a bunch of chemicals and is similar to a salt scrub. It's not all wet, so don't go wiping it on your face without first getting it wet. The best way to use it, in my opinion, it to take a little pinch/scoop of it and add it to your body scrubber. I think an electric face scrubbing brush is fine it you have shower doors or a shower curtain to keep any pieces from flying all over, but this helps get the scrub really worked into the skin. You can also use it on a body sponge/wash cloth or even with your fingers.<br /><br />It doesn't have a terribly strong smell, it's actually quite mild, which is fine because you don't always need to smell strongly with purfumes and fragrances. Over all it's a good scrub and works well for what it is used for.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

    "text": "I have never been the type of girl to stand in front of a mirror and do make up for long periods of time. I have used a hand mirror for years, I prefer to sit somewhere like a bed or couch and do my make up. Using a hand mirror is harder though because you then only have one hand to work with the make up. While I don't do a ton, opening things like mascara or doing eye liner is a lot harder when you only have one hand.<br /><br />This mirror stands up on it's own, so you don't have to hold it. It has a pretty red exterior and it even lights up. The light is not a really bright one, but enough to light up your face if you are in a room that is not as bright as you would like. The rim lights up on both sides, the regular mirror side and on the zoomed in mirror side. There is a place to plug it in, but no plug, so you can choose that option if you have a plug. I used the 3 AAA batteries that it came with. It works well for me to be able to do my make up without having to stand in the bathroom and I don't have to hang onto a hand mirror.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

This bottle took me by surprise, it has a dropper top similar to those in essential oil bottles (which makes sense with the dark blue bottle and it being made with oils like jojoba)<br />The oil goes on easy, he can just shake a few drops out and rub it in.<br /><br />He uses a boar bristle brush to help him get the oil down to the skin, it helps his beard stay softer and it has grown a lot longer than he usually lets it get. By now he usually gets fed up of it being itchy and shaves, but the oil stops the itchy issue.<br /><br />The bottle is 4 ounces, so it will last quite some time.

The ends are usually dull and they have a hard time grabbing anything. I was extremely happy when I opened this pack of 3. They are a sturdy stainless steel metal, no plastic or cheap aluminum. The ends of the silver one are extremely pointy, perfect for pulling out things like splinters and anything that might get stuck in the skin. My husband was working and ended up with a large splinter under his finger nail. Since you can't exactly get it from the top, we decided to use the silver sharp pair of tweezers and were able to extract the splinter from under his nail. They also work very well for removing hair. I pluck from time to time and the black and pink pair are really nice for that. The silver is easy to get out any ingrown hairs. Overall the set is very high quality and very professional.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

I had some friends tell me that mud masks are especially helpful for this, but that they are also good for exfoliating and keeping skin healthy. I tried using some bentonite clay as it says you  can use it as a mud mask, but it ended up clumpy and hard to spread on my face. I always ended up making too much too, which only wasted it. It was too much trouble and I stopped using it. I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a go. It is much darker than I expected, my entire face was blue/grey. It's very easy to spread on, I just used one finger and small swisp on each section of my face. It doesn't take too much, I figured it would take a big scoop, but really it took much less. I have used it three times already, each before bed, and you can't even see a dent in how much was in the jar. I left it on about 10 minutes each time and then wiped it off with a wet wash cloth. My skin feels softer, is not breaking out, and my husband even noticed a difference.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

After donating 4 pony tails to locks of love, as my hair reached all the way down to my knees when I was standing up, I thought my hair would be easy to care for. But if I'm not careful, I still get very bad tangles in my short hair. Now that I am starting to grow it out again, I thought my troubles would be back, but I received an opportunity to try this brush at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased, review. (all opinions are my own) I took my hair down from it's ponytail and ran the brush through, figuring it would get caught fairly quickly. To my surprise, it didn't really snag at all. It actually did as it claimed. My hair was smooth and the spot at the base of my skull that always gets missed no matter how hard I try, was also smooth and untangled. I am really shocked. I have tried so many brushes for myself and had sort of given up on finding something just for me. I will be keeping my brush in a safe place so my kids don't lose it and recommending to all of my friends. I am very happy with this purchase and would buy it again. It is worth the money.",

You get two mirrors for the price of one, a regular mirror and one with a higher magnification for those times when you need a closer inspection.  The light has a lovely, and very helpful, color temperature that's pretty close to daylight, just a bit warmer, and is featured around both mirrors.  It's operated by a switch on the bottom, so you aren't wasting your batteries.  It runs off of two coin batteries.  The mirror is larger than most.

You wouldn't think a little buzzing device could make your skincare products do their best job but boy, oh, boy does it ever.  The three settings are for Cleansing (also used for extractions), Moisturizing, and Lifting.  Each setting causes the device to vibrate at different speeds and achieve different goals.  Using it is fairly easy.  Hold the button until you hear it turn on and then give the button a quick press to choose between functions.  There are lights above each mode and they will light up when you are on said mode.  The included instructions are very easy to follow and explain how to use it in a simple way.  It's all about keeping very light pressure, while holding the side bars, which add the effective charge to the device, allowing the ionization process to take place.  I have seen a difference in my skin already and I have only used it in each mode 3-4 times.  It could be easy to overdo it after seeing the results you do, but the instructions specifically advice you on how often each function should be used so the skin isn't having reverse effects from what you want it to.  I think the price for this item is fantastic!  I have a reduction in blackheads, my skin seems to glow after use, and my products are sinking into my skin better and faster.  This one for the win!",

    "text": "I'm someone with extremely thick and stick straight hair.  My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.",

    "text": "I've always wanted to get into the art of doing my own acrylics so when I saw this drill set, I knew I had to review it.  Firstly, it comes with numerous accessories- a fluffy brush for removing dust from the nail and work area, a set of to separaters for painting, a nail board, and the drill bits themselves.  The entire set is nicely packaged and comes nestled in a velvety foam materials.  The bits are held in their own clear container within the box.  The set comes with a detachable adapter that plugs into the end of the drill and then into the wall outlet.  The drill itself is small enough to handle pretty easily, although I can see where it would be difficult for someone with smaller hands than myself (I have large hands.)  Inserting and removing the bits can be a challenge.  The mechanism isn't well made so I have to fight with it.  The power cord is much too short and I had to use an extension cord to give myself some wiggle room away from the wall outlet.  Some of the bits' textures do a better job than the others, while some don't do anything at all.  The over all look and feel of the set isn't worth the price, in my opinion.  It works a bit too awkwardly to be something I'd use that often.",

    "text": "This kit is a great deal!  I've been a devoted user of Korean skin care products.  For a while, I have preferred, out of several brands and types of sheet mask, the Benton Bee and Snail sheet mask.  Fantastic product!!!!  Firms, smooths, soothes.  It's great.  However, that's not why I purchased this set.  I have combo skin that leans towards oily in the heat.  Super oily T-zone.  After doing a ton of research, I decided to give the Benton Aloe Gel moisturizer a try.  I'd also heard great things about this foam cleanser.  I'm really enjoying the cleanser so far.  I wet my hands and face, use only a pea sized amount, rub my hands together to create the foam (not a soapy lather, but a thick and creamy foam), and work over my face.  I do this after oil cleansing.  This does a great job of picking up any oil residue and dirt, while leaving my face soft and refreshed.  Never tight and dry, which is the sign of an awful cleanser.  The gel moisturizer is okay.  Just okay.  I don't get as oily as I did with lotion moisturizers, which is great.  However, I don't have that supple, smooth feel that I'm used to and prefer.  I've actually noticed flaking around my nose, which is something I never dealt with after moisturizing.  A pea sized amount covers my entire face, it leaves a slightly tacky finish until absorbed ( I always let each of my products absorb for around 90 seconds before applying the next step), and is completely colorless.  Will I repurchase?  No, but I do suggest that you give this a try if your research and needs point you this direction.  Everyone's skin care needs can vary on several levels.  There are universal musts for good skin health, like cleansing daily, moisturizing, and using a good sunscreen.  There a a ton a variations of those products, though.  Finding the right routine and products can be a trial and error process.  The main thing is to stick to it.  The results are worth it!",

After reading more about this brush, she liked the features it mentioned and<br />decided to try it. It arrived well packaged, and undamaged. It came with instructions and a usb<br />cord. After trying it for a while, my wife said she really likes the shape and the way it feels in her<br />hand. It is easy to maneuver around the contours of her face and she feels her face is getting<br />cleaner after using it. Although she likes the red light feature, it is not something she uses<br />regularly. She does like that it is small enough to carry in her purse. However, one of the main<br />reasons she wanted this is because of the waterproof capability. But with the usb port open, she<br />really does not feel comfortable using it in the shower. That was a disappointment. Also, it<br />does not come with a carrying case or bag, which would have been nice. I am giving it four<br />stars because the features we are left with are good ones and my wife feels that her skin has<br />improved since using this brush.",

    "text": "Gotta take a moment to write a review because this is my favorite soap.  The other kind they make (the non-exfoliating kind) went through phases - first it was exfoliating, then they got bad reviews because it was TOO exfoliating (which I absolutely loved about it), then they removed ALL of the exfoliation and got bad reviews because there wasn't any exfoliation any more... and finally they got it together to have two varieties, one without any exfoliation, and one with exfoliation - this one.  And the other one is now stuck with a 3 star review average just because of that mix-up.<br /><br />At first I was nervous that even with the exfoliation back (this one), it would not be as good as it was before when it had the exfoliation originally, because it used to be oatmeal for the exfoliation, and now it is coffee grounds.  I even sent them a note asking why they didn't use oatmeal any more, and they said it was because the oatmeal version would fall apart in the Amazon warehouses.  But I tried the coffee ground exfoliation - and even though it isn't quite as good - it's still great.  This soap beats any other I've tried to purchase, and I have purchased about 10 brands through Amazon that all said they were exfoliating.  Only one of them was exfoliating enough, and I like this one better.  (I forget the name of that other brand right now; I'm at my computer.  If someone really wants to know, add a comment and I'll dig it up.)  I really need a very strong exfoliating soap, and this one actually is strong enough.  It also happens to be a brown bar with a decent hearty soap material, as well - not phony - so it is all I need.<br /><br />Just wanted to post this review to start to bring back some 5 stars for this company now that they've gotten things sorted out and have two varieties, one exfoliating and one that isn't.",

People like me, who can't find strong exfoliating soap from any other brand (I have specifically ordered at least 10 other brands, Loofah, etc. etc. just trying to find one with strong exfoliation - and none have it, except maybe Tasmanian (http://amzn.com/B00CQOHOXY (but this is better)), can now use Honest For Men again - their exfoliating line.  So not this listing, but the other listing.  Not that exfoliating soap should matter, but actually, I'd be scrubbing with rocks from brooks if humans lived out in nature.<br /><br />*** Original review a few days before ***<br /><br />This was my favorite soap - and I depended on it for the fantastic exfoliation, better than any other I've tried (and I tried a dozen kinds).<br /><br />All of a sudden, in this last batch, they have simply removed the exfoliation completely.  Now, when you look at the website, it says &#34;Important Information: We have recently removed our exfoliating oats and coffee grounds due to customer feedback. Our scent is now 100% essential oils no fragrance oil.&#34;<br /><br />Well, I'm here to give you a 1 star review for this &#34;important information&#34;.  There are 1,000 other soaps that you can buy with various interesting scents, etc.  But this was the only soap you can buy that had great exfoliation.<br /><br />And now they've removed it.<br /><br />Hopefully, the 'customer feedback' that caused them to remove the exfoliation will be blasted away by the customer feedback complaining that the exfoliation is missing, and they'll put it back.<br /><br />In the meantime - goodbye, 'Honest for Men'.",

Basically, I'd go whenever I hated my hair so I'd have to chop inches off of split ends. But now I have a salon and a hair stylist I love so I'm trying to go every 3 or so months. My stylist recommended that I start using a hair diffuser whenever I dry my hair because I have naturally curly hair.<br /><br />I don't use heat on my hair often but when I do, I've been attaching this to my hair dryer. I have the Infiniti Pro by Conair 1875 Watt Full Size Salon Performance AC Motor Styler/Hair Dryer (that I also bought from Amazon) and this fits on it perfectly. I read reviews that sometimes this hair diffuser doesn't work on all hair dryers because the diameter is smaller or larger than what this is compatible. But I measured the diameter of my hair dryer so I knew it would work. And I love how my hair reacts to being diffused. My curls just look marvelous. I almost wish I had time to blow dry my hair every day - almost.<br /><br />I love how it's collapsible so it doesn't take up too much space under my sink.

I recommend getting some tutelage on a forum or youtube about care of horsehair brushes- Being a bit of a masher (my old boar brushes are pretty splayed), I wound up with a bit of a birdsnest in the center of the brush which i had to detangle. I was immediately disappointed and shelved it- I was going to try and sell it. But the few great shaves I had made me want to try to use it right and now, with less pressure (ease up if it feels scratchy at all) and slightly different motions (figure 8s instead of circles, incidentally) I get great lather (using tabac) and the brush doesn't tangle- and it's even smoother and softer on the face.

    "text": "After having used this product for a month, I find myself hooked.  As YMMV when taking someone's word on shave gear, I thought I might provide some background about me:  I have gentle to oily skin and stiff, tough neck hairs.  I used to think I had sensitive skin until I married someone with actual sensitive skin.  But the combination of the tough hairs and the gentleness of my skin leads to irritation on the neck when I am not careful.  I learned to shave with a gillette adjustable years ago(which I still use), but out of &#34;convenience&#34; (really, a lack of good shaving products and knowhow) I stopped using it for cartridge systems in my early twenties.  Since I started shaving right, some time ago, I got an EJ-89 which I use when I'm feeling raw, and an old type open comb gillette (which, for the moment at least, I favor for its closeness- I use personna lab blue blades or sharper in it).  I've tried a number of different soaps and a few creams, most of which are good.  Mitchell's is excellent.  It has a simple, clean smell like fresh linen and is the most thoroughly hydrating shaving product I have ever used.  It lathers up easily-  I've used my beat up old drugstore boar brush which is now probly 15 years old and a silvertip badger brush.. In either case, the lather whips up in a minute or less with no complications.  I'm not one of these people that soaks the puck either, I just heat it up in its dish, in a basin of hot water as I soak my brush and it is good to go.  I've heard that water hardness and temp can make a difference with this stuff, but as I have decidedly soft water here in the city, I can't really comment on that.  But once you get the lather right, with enough water, it is eaaasy on the face.  Amazing even..  I dreamt wetshaving was like this as a teenager..<br />  One might be put off by the price which may seem hefty for a newcomer to the wetshaving game, eager to start saving money (previously lost on walking the cartridge treadmill) and reticent to buy apparently expensive luxury shaving soaps, but aside from being a quality product, It lasts for a quite a while.  I was really going to wait until I had exhausted mine to write this review but it's been a month, and the puck looks basically the same size!  Growing up on Williams soap and favoring Van der Hagen as a drugstore standby these days, I notice one soap generally lasts me a month (some less than that), but aside from the simply larger size of Mitchells (4.4 oz to 2.5 oz for standard mug size soaps), you just get more bang for your buck.  I'm guessing this one will last me three months or more.. So at that rate, the price basically factors out altogether.<br />  To sum up, if you have gentle or easily irritated skin and aren't looking for a heavily scented product, this is the grail of soaps for you.  One word:  I wouldn't spring for the dish because I am cheap.  You might not be.. But the soap itself does perfectly fit a rice bowl or large ramekin, in case you were wondering.. Probably not a mug though, unless it were seriously oversized..",

The soak off is MUCH easier with this as the base coat. They come off faster, more cleanly and leave behind no damage.<br /><br />I'm only giving it three stars for a few reasons. It doesn't do what it says it should do. It does lift. On my second try, after the first experiment, I did my nails again. Several nails lifted and peeled. Some came completely free with no damage. Usually my gels outlast my level of interest, and I soak them off before I even go the full two weeks. These definitely have a gripping problem. That's not a negative for me. It makes polish changes easier. However, it mean that they don't do what they're supposed to do.<br /><br />Bottom line, the things about this product that make it convenient for me are counter to what the product is advertised as doing.

The colors are different than the pack I ordered and when I looked back I couldn't find a pack that actually included the colors sent to me.

They don't even touch each other when shrink wrapped together! Maybe it was the change in pressure as I live a mile high?<br /><br />I DO love the consistency and longevity of the lotion, so that's what counts here.

We'll see how that works :-)  I wish I'd gotten the more solid, dark blond or light brown.  I purchased the 18&#34; extensions based on other reviews that said they are very thin at the bottom -- I wanted more thickness to my hair, not more length (although I would have been open to additional length if that worked out) and I wanted enough length that I could trim them, if needed.  I'm glad I did this -- I was able to cut off about 2&#34; of very wispy ends to match my own hair length.  When I clipped them in before cutting them to length, the wispy ends looked obvious and weird where they extended beyond my own hair length because there just wasn't enough hair at the ends to look right.  In any case, when I cut them to match my own hair length, they did exactly what I wanted -- I ended up with a nice thick braid.  These extensions are totally straight -- to achieve the look of the woman in the photo with wavy hair, you'd need to use a curling iron or curlers to add that wave.",

It is a light weight, fast asorbing serum with no fragrence to irritate sensitive skin. I use it before applying the hydrating gel. Can be used alone or worn under make up. Make-up application simply glides on almost like using a primer. I use this (along with the hydrating gel) twice a day, in the morning after my shower while my pores are still open and before bed after washing my face with a gentle non-soap cleanser.

I do this all the time especially when it comes to cleaning products or makeup. In this case I was offered a bottle of Pure Body Naturals‚Ñ¢ 100% Natural Nail Polish Remover and the skeptical part of me was sure this wouldn't turn out well. But in the spirit of trying new things, I agreed to review it and put it to the test.  **See the images for before/after photos**<br /><br />For my test I painted my nails several different colors. We all know deep reds are harder to get off and glitters can also be a pain to remove. I dedicated my left hand to the Pure Body Naturals‚Ñ¢ 100% Natural Nail Polish Remover and my right hand I used a drugstore brand of acetone polish remover (the super cheap stuff I usually use.)  Both hands got two good coats of polish.<br /><br />To remove the polish the Pure Body Naturals‚Ñ¢ remover instructions say to drop or dab it on and wait 2-3 minutes before wiping. For the generic acetone remover I just apply and wipe with a cotton ball.<br /><br />The Pure Body Naturals‚Ñ¢ remover wiped right off, taking most of the polish with it. I did have to reapply a small amount, wait a few more minutes and all but one tiny trace of the red polish was gone.  The acetone remover left polish near my cuticles even after a hard scrubbing and a second try.<br /><br />So what did I like?<br />-I like that it works better than the acetone remover, even on the darkest red and glitter!<br />-I like that it did not make my nails feel dry.<br />-I like that the Pure Body Naturals‚Ñ¢ remover doesn't have harsh chemicals.<br />-I like that it isn't tested on animals.<br />-I like that it comes with a handy glass dropper.<br /><br />The only problem (and it could have been a BIG one) is this polish will eat through any polish, including vanish on my dining room table and styrofoam plates. No kidding. I started out thinking to drip the remover over a plate to keep it off the table but it quickly melted the styrofoam and one small spot of the table varnish.<br /><br />Only use this stuff in the bathroom over tile or a sink with no finish/paint/lacquer, etc. never over a delicate surface like your dining room table!<br /><br />I received a free sample of this remover to review.  I have given my honest opinion and the real test/comparison results.",

    "text": "The gene pool I come from has Viking, German, and Irish heritage -- resulting in a stiff wiry beard that defeats most cordless beard trimmers.  To give this trimmer a good chance I followed the directions and charged it for the two hours as recommended in the instructions.  My only gripe about this process is that you're supposed to keep an eye on it so that when charging is finished you can disconnect it immediately to avoid potential damage.  Since the unit has no automatic shut-off when charging is completed, you have to keep an eye on it to avoid a problem.  That is my only gripe about this unit.  Not too many people have the time flexibility to watch it for the two hours (or less) it needs to charge.<br /><br />While it only comes with 3 attachments that is all you really need.  The shaver itself is large enough to give you a firm grip and the weight implies quality.  The initial effort at trimming my beard was highly successful.  I grew it for two weeks to make it a challenge and then shaved it without using any attachments.  Normally (with other units) I would have expected difficulty in shaving it flush with my skin. Typically this type of trimmer is not powerful enough to plow through my beard, pulls some hair out instead of cutting it, and sometimes nicks my skin.  None of that happened here.  Evidently the battery and the motor are up to the task.<br /><br />This is by far the best cordless trimmer I have ever owned and used.  Highly recommended!",

The scent is very light and pleasant as well.<br /><br />This is my first experience with purchasing argan oil after months of researching various companies and I did well! :-) The seller was great as it arrived early and in perfect condition.<br /><br />I want to see how well it will help with regrowing my hair as I use it in conjunction with certain vitamins and a certain shampoo and conditioner...alopecia issues. I will continue to use this product for what it has already proven to accomplish and I highly recommend it.",

Funny, my hair/scalp isn't as sensitive to shampoos as it is to conditioners.  This shampoo, however, leaves my hair feeling softer/smoother but not weighed down at all.  Actually, when you're rinsing it out, you can still feel that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling; not that greasy feeling you get with other conditioners.  But, it does soften/moisturize the hair.

I was able to straighten if I wanted to and once washed, it went back to it's beautiful natural texture.<br />My only issue with this is the net is huge and I had issues with how to apply it without it bulking up. As I said, I'm not the best with these things but it seems that this piece could be a bit smaller. My 2nd issue is that the strip of hair to wrap around to secure is very thin. I've seen others that are thicker w/ more hair, which makes it easy to hide where the fake hair is secured to your actual ponytail. My 3rd issue is the velcro kept getting caught on my real hair. You have to be super careful but since it was a bit difficult to secure because of the huge net, sometimes I was going so slow that the hair would shift and I had to start again. Kind of hard to explain but I think if I could apply this without worrying about pulling my hair out, it would be easier to secure. Anyway, once I got it on it looked great and I'm sure I'll use it here or there. Just some things for potential buyers to be aware of.",

NOPE.  The edges kept lifting up and the lash fell off after a couple of blinks.  OK I thought, maybe my liner wasn't thick enough, so I applied another really good coat and then tried the lash again....Same results.  I then washed my eye again and tried with my other liner and the lash stayed on like it should.<br />I like the lashes very much.  All three pair are a natural length (IF you use mascara), and vary in looks.  If you get these, make sure you have another liner available or plan to purchase one.",
