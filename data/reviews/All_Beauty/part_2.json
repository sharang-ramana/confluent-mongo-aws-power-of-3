It has a fantastic fragrance of lavender that I am a huge fan of. It is fantastic especially in the evening because it just has a very calming effect on top of the refreshing feel of it. It leaves a slight tack residue on the skin but that goes away in about 5 to 10 minutes, so no big deal. I for one really like this one and it hits every aspect that it should. I use this in the evening and like how my skin looks and feels in the morning. All in all very happy and this is one of the ones I see myself reaching for more often than not.",

I have to admit I was a bit disappointed since I do prefer the pump dispenser but oh well, just wish they would actually show the real product to be honest. The leave-in conditioner itself smells fantastic so that is a huge plus.<br /><br />When you then dip into the jar to get some of the conditioner out, it is actually pretty thin and runny, which was quite a surprise to me to be honest. Taking a leave-in conditioner out of a jar is a bit of a challenge to be honest. Doing a pump or two is just so much easier. I found that this conditioner left a residue on my hair that I did not care for. It also weighed my hair down that just was undesirable as well. I for one am not a huge fan of this one and can't recommend this conditioner, I just don't like it sadly because my hair just didn't look good, nor felt great. At least it is not expensive and it may work for others but this just didn't work for me at all.",

    "text": "Dr. Au Anti Aging Face Oil took me a little bit by surprise to be honest. This is a very nice retinol oil that has quickly become one of my favorites. It comes in a little dropper bottle. It has a very mild and very pleasant fragrance that I really like a lot. It lingers for a bit and I wish it would linger a lot longer than it does to be honest. I can't figure out what it smells like but I really like the mix of it. This contains retinyl palmitate, related to retinol. Remember, whenever you use retinol you want to make sure to protect your skin from the sun since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. However retinol is very good for your skin.<br /><br />This face oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave your skin slightly oily but to me that is ok since I am using a face oil. I prefer to use this at night for two reasons, one because my face is a bit oily for a while when using it and also because retinol containing products do make your skin more sensitive to the sun. When I use this product my skin feels always super soft and smooth and looks nicely moisturized. There are little specs in it that look like gold and I am not sure if it is that or something else but when I use this facial oil my skin has this natural glow to it that I really like. This oil is fantastic and is quickly becoming one of my go to facial oils.",

I let it sit in my hair for a while whenever I use it to make sure the working ingredients can do their job. It rinses out quite easily so no issues there. I felt my hair just looked ok when I use it and haven't noticed any effects in regards to their promises. There hasn't been an increase of hair loss. There is maybe a little bit less hair loss when it comes to when I am in the shower I notice maybe a little bit less hair in the drain. Other than that I really don't see that much effect when I use it. But it is not expensive and it is not a bad shampoo. Because of all of that I rate this as an average shampoo.",

You notice the fantastic fragrance of the mask, very strong of honey which I love. It is very smooth and smells incredible in my eyes.<br /><br />The material of the sheet is very nice and soft. I found it is a bit big however so it does take some adjustment to be honest to make it fit. I do prefer that over a mask being too small however. Make sure to clean your face prior to using it, just like the instructions say. You leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes and then remove it. Any residual serum is just gently massaged into the skin.<br /><br />I found that my skin loves this mask. It feels nice and soft, smooth and just looks nicely moisturized. It has a natural glow to it that says I did something good for it. It does feel a bit sticky for about 5 minutes right after, but that goes away and then you are left with soft and smooth skin. In this box, that btw is perfect as a gift as well, you get 10 masks for just $24, which I think is a very good price and allows you to do something good for your skin for some time.",

It comes in a simplistic looking squeeze tube, that almost looks medicinal in my eyes.<br /><br />The cream has a very pleasant fragrance that I personally really like. The cream itself is a medium weight in my eyes and does take a little bit to absorb into the skin fully. It does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin that takes some time to fully disappear. Because of this I would recommend this as an evening cream because you wouldn't want to apply foundation over it, nor would you want to wear a face mask all day while having that on your skin. I found that products like this make me sweat quite heavily under face masks.<br /><br />I use this in the evenings and do find that in the morning my skin looks nicely moisturized, is soft and smooth. So it does look exactly as I would expect it to with this kind of product.

    "text": "I have always been a fan of Taya hair products. I found though that this duo is not one of my favorites. In this pack you get a shampoo and conditioner that are basically travel size for $14. They are a bit bigger than you would get at a hotel for example so you get quite a few applications out of them, but for $14 I find this to be rather expensive to be honest.<br /><br />The bottles are pretty cute and look nice. When I used the shampoo I have to say I was disappointed by the fragrance. Usually this line has a fantastic fragrance but this one just wasn't it. It produced a decent lather and rinsed out with ease. The conditioner had a similar fragrance in line with the shampoo. It was nice and soft and I did leave it in my hair for about 3 minutes I would say. It was easy to rinse out and left no residue on my hair. My hair overall looked ok once it was dry and was pretty soft but nothing impressive that would warrant spending $14 on this. I am sorry I just wasn't impressed with this set, especially since you can get the full sized ones for a similar price really.",

You then distribute this serum in your hair and when you do that you notice the incredible fragrance of this serum. It is probably my FAVORITE fragrance in my hair products. Its this amazing mix of tropical fruit and this something that is just amazing! It is hard to try out other things when all I want it is this one.<br /><br />It comes in this easy to use pump dispenser and you just do a couple of pumps and distribute that in your palms. Then distribute all then evenly into your hair that is either wet or damp. Your hair is easy to brush through at that point, not a tangle in sight. Once my hair was dry it was soft, light and shiny. Everything it promised it would do. My hair just looked amazing and felt soft.  I love this product, it smells amazing, my hair looks incredible with lots of shine and lift to it, and it just feels amazing, soft and smooth. I can't say enough good things about this!",

    "text": "This is an interesting face mask. You get 5 masks for $20 so an ok price, maybe slightly more expensive than usual. You apply this mask to a clean face like you always do.  When you open the package you find 2 masks in it, they split the mask up into 2, the top and bottom.<br /><br />This mask is the first cream mask I have ever used. You will first notice the pleasant scent, the reason I ordered this in the first place. I have a serum by Abib that I love and has an incredible fragrance so I figured this one has to be a great product. This mask feels kind of weird on your face because of the cream. It reminds me a bit of nivea cream to be honest, fragrance wise and thickness / consistency wise. So after the 20 minutes are up you take it off and realize there is still a lot of cream on your face. So you gently massage it into your skin. My face felt a bit sticky from all that extra cream to be honest. After about 20 minutes or so that feeling did start to fade, that is just how long it took for all of it to absorb. This is one rich cream I tell you.  My face was nicely moisturized though and it definitely had a bit of a glow from all that cream to it to be honest.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice mask, but maybe a bit too rich for me. I think this would do wonders when your skin is super dry, like on a horrible winter day when you have been outside in the wind all day and your skin is almost peeling off from the cold dry wind. This would restore it back to health. Right now my skin is just a bit too healthy I would say and this one would just be so much better when my skin is in dire need.",

These will only run you about $10 so definitely on the cheap side. Each lipstick comes in a little plastic container that has a Halloween themed print on it. They are fairly cheap but again, getting 12 lipsticks for $10 I don't have high expectations.<br /><br />I found there is some range in colors but not a big one. There are some darker colors and some lighter colors and then the rest all was somewhat similar. I was a bit disappointed by the colors really, but then again, for the price can I really say anything about that? There weren't really any nudes in there.<br /><br />The lipsticks were easy to apply but not that creamy. However they feel ok on the lips. They are not very sticky or anything but also don't feel super smooth or creamy on the lips either. They feel just ok really. They don't taste or smell of anything. Their staying power is ok, they wear off as you eat and drink like a lot of lipsticks do really. So considering these costs $10 for 12 of them, they are not horrible. They feel ok on the lips, the color range is limited in my eyes but they are not bad at all, all considering. Keeping everything in mind, I am rating them at 3 stars.",

I have some cloth masks but they should be washed and when I forget or they are in the wash it is nice to have a back up.<br /><br />You get this convenient box with 50 disposable masks in it. I really like that you get this in a box so they are easy to use. In the box you get 5 bags of 10 masks each which is great. So you can actually take one of these bags and keep them where you need them, very convenient.  These are similar to the ones we use at work and these work. These fit well and are comfortable. They get the job done and protect me while I am out and about and need to be protected. It is a strange world right now but I am glad we have ways to get these kinds of masks right now. They do have the little metal clip on the nose so you can make them fit properly which a lot of people don't usually do for some odd reason, but especially if you have glasses you really should take advantage of that. The loops around the ears were plenty big so no complaints there.",

It is perfect for teens if you ask me but I have no problem putting that on my shelf either. So to keep the comparison going, at the same volume it is cheaper than LouLou but if you get the 2.7 Fl Oz you pay the same price as you would for the 1.7 Fl Oz for LouLou so you could get a better deal but even though they are similar there are just different enough that I can smell the difference if I do a blind test.",

I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my skin feel a lot better to be honest and give it an amazing smell to boot.

I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are a gorgeous minty green. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $13 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten to date so not sure if that is worth it but these are nice and sturdy and made well.",

It has step by step instructions that are easy to follow and you end up with great looking nails. It actually doesn't take too long either since you can cure 4 nails at a time in the UV lamp except the thumps. So far I have only used the gray and really like that color a lot.<br /><br />Now what I really wish is that they have an adjunt kit where you can order more colors to go with the kit to mix it up some. Just having pink and gray is not enough in my eyes and let's face it having more options would be great where you could pick and choose other colors.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can just peel off the nail polish when you are done instead of having to use harsh chemicals to remove it. I always hated that part and that was one reason why I don't often use nail polish, that and the fact that regular nail polish is pretty damaging to your nails. Gel nail polish is actually pretty gentle to your nails and protecting at that plus it looks great.<br /><br />No complaints here, very happy with how long it took and the end results.",

It produces a nice lather that rinses out easily. What I do not like is the fact that it has silicone in it.<br /><br />The conditioner in my eyes is much nicer. The big problem is, the pump dispenser does not work. The conditioner is just too thick and can not be pumped up for some reason. So the suggestion of another reviewer to switch the lids is not a bad one. The conditioner smells much nicer than the shampoo and produces a very nice soft feel on your hair while still wet. It also rinses out nicely.<br /><br />When your hair is dry it does look and feel very nice. So in combination your hair does look nice when you use this combination, just not sure I am a huge fan of the shampoo in this set. All in all this gets a 3 star for me since the conditioner is pretty good, the shampoo is just below average in my eyes. As a set it may be just a tad overpriced though.",

With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is. I really liked this mask but it is on the more expensive side. You get 4 masks in the box for $25, so each is about $6, so that is a bit on the higher end of sheet masks but they are very nice.",

    "text": "This is a very nice hand care bundle for very hands on people. First you get a very nice hand cleaner that contains activated charcoal. This detoxes and cleans very nicely of the toughest dirt, eliminating strong odor but doesn't damage your hands like some strong cleaners might do.<br /><br />Next you get a moisturizing and healing cream. This is great for those who have done some damage to their hands in some physical hand jobs where they hand up with dry and cracked hands. This gives back some moisture and heals those hands.<br /><br />Last but not least is a nice protect and moisturizer. This adds a nice barrier to your hands but also adds much needed hydration to much abused hands that are dry, cracked and scaly. When you have this on your hands it is much easy to wash and wipe away stubborn dirt.<br /><br />This is a nice little set that can also be gifted, especially for people who work with their hands like mechanics or wood workers but many others. This works really well and will help restore some of those much abused hands.",

This moisturizer absorbs very quickly but your skin doesn't feel super soft after you apply it. Yes it is soft but I have other moisturizer that make my skin feel a lot softer when I use them.<br /><br />It comes in this really cute pump dispenser that is very stylish. What I did not like about this moisturizer is the scent of it. I can't pinpoint what it smells like but I did not particularly care for it. Thankfully the scent does not linger very long on your skin. The other thing I did not understand that in the directions of using it it says \" follow with moisturizer or makeup\". Why would I have to use a moisturizer after using this moisturizer? Pretty confusing if you ask me.<br /><br />All in all this product is just ok in my book. It felt ok on my skin, smelt bad to me at least and the instructions were weird to say the least. For this price you can get some other products that work better and definitely smell better!",

    "text": "This is a decent makeup brush set. Would I pay $40 for this, NEVER. First the bag is very nice. The 4 brushes that come with it are also very nice, but are they basically worth $10 a brush, no. For that kind of money you are better of buying a Sigma brush. I was also supposed to get a makeup brush cleaner in this, but that was missing.<br /><br />In this set you get a powder brush that was nice and fluffy and worked well. You also get a foundation brush that was also very nice. The flat cream concealer brush worked well and you also get a concealer detail brush that again worked really well. None of these are outstanding and any better than you can find in the beginner sets you can get for like $10 to $20 depending on the set size. So getting the bag and supposed brush cleaner that I did not get does not warrent the $40 in my eyes.",

I wouldn't consider this a matte finish, but it isn't really shiny either. It has decent staying power (you can eat or drink while wearing it). Overall, this is a terrific lipstick to put in my rotation. I'd recommend it.",

I'm even ok with the firm bristles (nylon and boar), because I have coarse hair and I'm not tender headed.  I like that it smooths the hair easily.  What I don't like is the PRICE. I can't believe they expect people to pay $49 for this brush. Yikes! And the sad thing is that it didn't even come in pretty packaging. Just in a simple white box.

There are some pretty nice ingredients that include tea tree oil, salicylic acid and aloe. I've used the product for a few days now and have not noticed any dryness or irritation. Nor have I noticed any redness or rashes. The scent of the cleanser is not strong (smells like tea tree oil) and does not linger long. And finally, what I like the most? This company has made a product in a bottle that is reusable. I really like companies who have a philosophy to reduce their impact on the world.

I can't decide. I'm torn. After using VC12 for about 3 weeks, I am still unsure of the results.<br /><br />The concept: Vitamin C is slow released thru the skin by mixing a small amount of VC12, with water or a moisturizer, onto the face and neck. The results, brighter, smoother and firmer skin. The powder comes in a convenient small bottle (about the length of your thumb) with a small spoon (used for measuring). Simply mix the appropriate amount - I use about 2 spoonfuls since I put it on my face and neck- with a lightweight moisturizer. I didn't notice any tightness, irritation or itching after I applied this to my skin (i.e., face and neck). I simply apply my makeup as usual. With that being said, I haven't noticed anything bad either -no additional breakouts and no nasty white film (left on my face from bad blending). But I also haven't looked in the mirror and said “wow” or “gosh, this is like a facelift in a bottle moment”.  Not to mention that this product takes a little more effort than my usual skincare regime. I am not use to mixing products before I use them. **Therefore, I am going to give this product 3 stars BUT continue to use it for a little longer to see if I am wowed. After all each container is believed to last about 3 months. If I notice something earth shattering in the next month or so, I will amend my review. Otherwise, this review will stand.",

Unfortunately I bumped the lamp off my table and it fell about 3 feet and stopped working...I didn't think it was much of a fall so I was pretty surprised it didn't turn on anymore.<br /><br />The lamp was compact and easy to use, fit one hand at a time. Fortunately I have another lamp but pretty bummed this one broke so easily.:/",

    "text": "(307) These lases are a little more dense so they definitely give the look of wearing false lashes, in kind of a more dated kind of way. I feel like the more spread out and whispy lashes are a lot more trendy these days. Band is quite thick also. Besides the band, the lashes themselves are pretty good quality and don't have a plastic sheen to them which is great. Price and quality is comparable to drugstore.<br /><br />(309) Also have a thicker band but are much more Whispy and have that fluffy instagram lash to them. Very pretty! I like these a lot better than the 307's. I'd give these a 5 and a 307 a 3 so since they're the same brand, I will average the review to a 4.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!",

It has longer and shorter hard bristles along the sides. I'm by no means a beginner with mascara, but for some reason I've poked my eye with this mascara applicator a couple of times already. The bristles just seem really hard and sharp!<br /><br />This could just be me having a problem for whatever reason, but thought I'd mention.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!",

I used dehydrator and a primer and when I put the base coat on, it would not smooth out and was lumpy. I'm not sure if it was the dehydrator and primer or the base coat itself, but I had to scrape it off and opted to note use it at all.

It comes with a storage for those accesories. I used the general use nozzle and noticed that the dial has no arrow to tell you what strength you're putting it to, you would only know while the power is on and the stream is going. On the lower setting, the water was spurting, not flowing smoothly, but did on a higher setting. There is a suspension control to pause it while using it. After you are done, it instructs you to dump the water. Overall, it worked as it should and I gave it four stars because of the spurting and no arrow on the dial.",

The microneedle blade is small enough for use. It makes little tiny, non-noticeable holes in the surface of your skin (in effect damaging it) so it will produce more collagen. While I wouldn't use it more than once a week, and just until my skin starts to get red, it does appear that my skin is softer and smoother after the treatment. So I'm find on the micro-needler. (Just remember gently, gently). The quartz roller is supposed to reduce redness, smooth the surface of the skin and help with lymphatic drainage. I'm not sure it actually does all that but it does feel nice and has definitely helped with under eye puffiness so it appears to be working. I'm very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of these devices and will continue to use them.<br /><br />The packaging is fine and makes them giftable but I'm not sure the quality of the pieces will actually hold up. I've been using them for several months and so far so good but if they do fall apart, I'm willing to invest in more expensive products. For a starter set, I would give this a try to be sure it works for you (and you are willing to do it).",

I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me.

With traditional stamping polish it is necessary to work very quickly in order to successfully transfer the image onto the nail, and beginners frequently struggle to get the timing down. Even experienced stampers have difficulties with extremely fine lines or highly detailed images; the stamping polish just dries too quickly inside the very shallow etching. After watching several She Modern videos on YouTube and ordering a small set of sticky stamping polishes, I was eager to test them out on a stamping plate I've been unsuccessfully trying to use for over a year. My very first effort was flawless! The She Modern performed perfectly. Beginners will definitely find these polishes far, far easier to work with as they learn the basics, and more advanced stampers can enhance their artwork by using pigment powders, foils, and glitter. In addition, She Modern offers a comprehensive selection of watercolor polishes for techniques such as lead lining, reverse stamping, etc. The only limit is your imagination and She Modern even helps with that by providing live demonstrations of their products and techniques on YouTube every Tuesday and Friday. Tina very thoroughly and patiently opens each session by answering any questions from attendees before creating a nail design with various products. It's very helpful to see them in use and gives you ideas for your own nail art. It's a great line of products for nail artists at ANY skill level and the product support is outstanding!",

    "text": "I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.  Keep in mind, I have very little hair and it is very very fine.  This curling iron really make my hair look amazing.",

If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.",

    "title": "Nice As Bronzer On Cooler Toned Skin, But Fabulous Eye Shadow Too,- Read On",
    "text": "I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.",

    "title": "Halloween Or Messing Around Okay, But Serious Wear, Not So Much",
    "text": "I have been working with wigs for quite a few years now.  One thing I know is a good quality vs not so great quality wig.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />HAIR<br />This wig has some great hair. the colors are definitely platinum white and what I would call light auburn base hairs.  The white hairs are about 1/3 or so longer than the auburn hairs.  There is a nice kink to the hairs.<br /><br />THICKNESS<br />That is where this wig is sadly lacking.  At the top, the wefts of hair are way too far apart. The lace in the cap is a very light butter colored yellow.  The hair is not too thin, but it is not quite thick enough to cover hair below.  Yes, this comes with a nylon cap, but it just is not comfortable with those.  If you have dark hair it will definitely show the bright colored lace and elastics through the wig when the wind blows.<br /><br />BANGS/STYLE<br />That is where this wig is just not practical unless you don't mind looking stupid for a party or Halloween.  The bangs are WAY too long for anyone to wear.  That usually would not be a problem, but what you will get instead of the cool light ends on the entire head is chopped bang that is bland looking and then these white cool looking ends around the head.  The bangs are best cut painstakingly so that the auburn is cut way shorter (about 2/3) than the white hairs.  That takes a lot of time but worth the effort.  Then you have to cut them at a staggered manner.<br /><br />Other than the bangs being hard to trim so you can at least function with this wig on, the overall style is fabulous.  I love how it falls and looks while on the head.<br /><br />ELASTIC BANDS<br />Inside the wig, there are elastic bands with hooks to help hold the wig on the head. You might want to take them down to the spot you like it in as the hooks have a tendency to come undone during wearing.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT IN A WIG<br />Believe it or not, I would actually wear a wig like this with the right outfit, and not to be silly either.  I prefer wigs that look authentic,, and can be worn realistically as well as for fun.<br /><br />1.  I have to be able to see out of it<br />2.  I have to be able to wear it comfortably without fussing<br />3.  I want it to not have my real hair showing<br />4.  I want it to look realistic<br />5.  I want it to last for quite a few wearings<br /><br />DOES THIS WIG PASS THE TEST?<br />I am giving this wig THREE stars because it is hard to wear and see.  In order to trim this in a realistic manner, I have to take a LOT of time and that takes stars off for me.  I happen to love the style and coloring, so I am wiling to put the work into it, but honestly, I think it should be a bit shorter in the bangs area since it is so hard to trim and keep it looking real.  Also, the wefting on the top is just a bit too widely spaced.  I wish also that the cap was made with light auburn lace and elastic instead of the icy yellow colors.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to wear this for fun, it will be hard to see and hard to trim and not look silly in this.  It is comfortable and the style is epic, but there will be work required.  You can bandana it to help, but it still will look a bit floppy unless trimmed a little bit in the bangs/fringe area.  I like this, but it takes work to wear and not look silly for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  The trimming of the bangs is VERY time consuming since we only have one shot at it and if it is screwed up, then the wig is toast.  I wish there was more hair on top and that the lace cap did not show as easily.  A darker cap underneath (light auburn color) would have been much nicer with this.  I will still use this, but it could have been a bit nicer with small inexpensive changes.",

    "text": "I have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.  It is not quite as nice as the Kolinsky Sable brushes I lost, but it is a nice fill in for now.  I would buy it again.",

    "text": "I am all about natural skin care.  When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.  Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.",

I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.",

    "title": "Best Battery Powered Brush We Have Ever Used Cleans As Good As Clarisonic Which We Also Have",
    "text": "We have been through several Clarisonic brushes in our house (Mine kept dying) and my daughter swears by her Clarisonic Mia.  She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.",

I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent.

I did take one star off because the little pair of scissors are really thin and flimsy. The first time my husband took them out to cut his large toenail, it bent them.

I was hesitating about ordering this product because of the price and after reading multiple reviews about different colors of the same polish that didn't have application thick enough. There were no reviews on this color (authentic apricot) and I decided to give it a try. I must say that I'm very pleasantly surprised. The picture I attached was taken on the 4th day after application and this is ONLY 1 COAT! Usually, all nail polishes start peeling the same day, because I do a lot cooking/cleaning but this one holds so well, I'm just amazed. And I should say that with the clean ingredients list and such a strong application it's worth the price. I felt like I had to leave this review to support the seller. Thank you to the company for making such good products!",

I can not smell any fragrance with this at all,<br />this is best used in light applications for body and hair- a little goes along way! Its NOT gloppy like olive oil/almond/canola, seems lighter than grape seed oil even.<br />Worth the $. I lightly apply it through my hair the day I need to wash it- lightly oil all hair, twist up/clip, time it like a light hot oil treatment so it can soak in and work. It is a God send for unruley eyebrows. It washes right out no residue. I do this 2 times a week. I live in the desert/New Mexico/hard water/50 yrs/unprocessed thick semi curly hair. My hair shines but its not oily looking after washing, it semi tames and makes it so much better...it looks alive and healthy. My beautican is astounded. I have found its so much cheaper and works far much better than high scale salon items. It feeds your hair and body.<br />How I apply this I squeaze a small amount (pea size) onto one palm then rub my hands/palms quickly together till oil is warm- then lay my hands on area and massage in-it sinks right into dry scaley elbows, chapped lips, wind burned knees- etc. it does leave a light very fine oil film if it doesnt soak in 100%. If that happens it doesnt stain my clothes.<br />Oddly I have found for some reason it heals skin/cuts/wind burn more quickly than salves.<br />I keep my oil bottle on the (metal) end of an old frozen OJ tube style container- making a tiny saucer in case a drop oil seeps out.<br />Just my 2 cents....",

You break one end so it flows to the other, and there's a LOT of stain in each cotton swab (there's 20 in the box, each wrapped in plastic). I think you can get two uses out of each one, but obviously, they're meant for single use.<br /><br />This stain works VERY well. The I am Fine color is reddish-brown, but it was a very nice red color on my lips. And my fingers - be careful when you apply these since they do stain. It's best to exfoliate before you use them, and to line your lips since I noticed a bit of bleeding/feathering when I used the product. Nothing that was obvious unless one was very close, but it would be prevented from lining my lips which I don't normally think to do when using a stain. Then again, the applicator is a cotton swab (so no fine control) and you get a LOT of product with it.<br /><br />It does last all day unless you eat something greasy/buttery. So this would be great for going out for drinks or doing anything where you avoid greasy food. Also, the instructions on the box are in Chinese.",

I definitely love the 'sunset/rose gold' palettes, and this reminds me of a Huda palette I have with similar shades. It's in a slim, cardboard palette without a mirror, but this is a lower price point for all the shades you get. The shadow itself is a creamy powder blend, and it suggests that you use your fingers for the metallic shades (I find a small crease blush works fine and tends to have less loose powder that way).<br /><br />You have a nice mix of matte and metallic shades this way, with a lot of earth tones. Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well. Why the three stars?<br /><br />I tried this with and without primer, and this kit definitely needs primer to last more than a couple of hours on my skin. Also? The mattes will last several hours, but not the metallics even with primer (as well as a setting spray on top). I love the metallic colors, but they just fade on me somehow - even if I layer them on top of the matte. I'm used to eyeshadow blending on me after a few hours, but never have I seen metallics melt away on me like this. That's not to mean it won't work better on other people.<br /><br />Still, for the price it's a nice range of colors and a fun palette to play with, so it's worth a try.",

The tool is extremely lightweight and has a tapered design which makes it so comfortable to use. The instructions are to use it for a minute each morning and evening. It has illustrations which show you to spend 20 seconds on the right side and 20 seconds on the left side and 20 seconds on the T-zone. The tool will actually buzz gently when you should move to the next area. This is a great feature! It also comes with 3 brush heads; massage, sensitive and normal skin. I am using the sensitive for now and it is perfect for a gentle exfoliation. When I am finished with that minute, my skin just glows and feels so clean! Hopefully the heads do not need replaced quickly as I do not think they are yet available on Amazon or online. It also comes with a sleek charger that does not take up any room at all on the counter – this is important to me as I have a small bathroom. Also, the LumaRx comes with a very nice carrying case that will come in handy for an upcoming vacation.",

I recently received a package of 50 of these with 10 large clips and have used them on a daily basis for so much more than just holding fabric together for stitching seams.  Even this small size holds together leather so I find that I don't need to rubber cement the pieces together as I have done in the past to hold the pieces together.  Kids love these, too, so be prepared to find that you need more than you ever anticipated.  I received samples for evaluation and love these clips.",

    "text": "eb5 line has been around for some time now and I have noticed their advertisements in print media over the years, but have not tried any of the line until I received this bottle of Collagen Booster Serum.  I am very surprised that I like this serum as much as I do, and I am more surprised at the competitive pricing for the entire line.  With no added fragrance, my sensitive skin responded well to the light and creamy product that was readily absorbed.  My skin was prepared for moisturizing and there was no irritation or annoyance due to a fragrance of the natural components which can occur.  The pump action is terrific and the cap keeps it protected from the elements, yet it is quick to remove for application.  There is no excessive packaging, so little waste.  Many years ago, Robert Heldfond Jr. and I were casual friends in San Francisco, occasionally having coffee together in North Beach, and I have thought of him each time I would see his father's picture in the advertisements I mentioned earlier.  I very much like to support family businesses and am pleased to finally try the product from his company which now has his wife at the helm.  I look forward to trying other products in the line.",

    "text": "Plastic and/or acrylic organizers come in all sizes, shapes, configurations and qualities.  MelodySusie® has blown me away with this three part, multiple sectioned organizer with drawers.  Just so you're clear, you get a base with four drawers, each with an flattened oval shaped pull, each lined with a black textile that can be removed or used as you choose.  The edges of the drawers are beveled, giving this an aura of elegance, but most importantly, each drawer slides in and out with ease, regardless of whether or not the drawer is packed or empty.  The bottom of the base has a little strip in the form which raises this organizer from sitting directly on the counter, so if it is used in a bathroom, air can circulate around the entire piece and grungy mildew and such is reduced from forming.  Don't forget to dust, though.  The exterior edges are beveled, giving them a very finished appearance, unlike those sharp edges on many similar products in the marketplace.<br /><br />Included with this organizer are two additional pieces, each is the same dimension as the interior of the top ridge of the chest organizer, so you can decide which one you want to put on top and which one you want to put next to the main component.  Or you can separate them entirely and use the top of the organizer to put items and use the two multi-sectioned components separately.  You could line them up side by side along a dresser top and have more width rather than extended height.<br /><br />I love the assorted sizes of the sections and the angles top of the shorter of the two pieces.  I also love the rounded design in the sections of the taller component.  Every aspect of this trio is outstanding, high quality, and it makes quite the impression in addition to comfortably storing whatever you like in each compartment.  Each edge is finished, every detail has been considered, and it is even practical in that it can quickly be cleaned with no harsh detergents. This lovely item was made in China and it is clear that quality control is important to the manufacturer because I saw no defect even after intense examination.  Be prepared for a weightier set than you might expect, because there was no skimping on the materials.  It is perfectly packed for protection and is ideal for presenting as a gift.  It is well worth its price point.  A sample was provided for review.",

The caps are push in type and is better than the lift up caps where the cover can easily break off.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, when you buy other travel container sets, I find that a few of the containers are useless, like the spray bottle and the little &#34;pill&#34; container with the screw off lid, at least for my needs.  This particular set has all of the type of containers that I needed, and more than enough for all the products that I carry.",

I usually still iron my hair, but it stays flat, even in Alabama's subtropical humidity. Otherwise, it doesn't matter what I do: by the time I walk from my house to the car, my hair is frizztastic. But with a keratin treatment, I can even just blow dry my hair and it look fantastic. This saves so much more time and it makes styling last for days. I also hike and get sweaty and my hair still looks great after it dries. Once, after a day of kayaking, I rode in the back of a friend's truck back to the marina, and my hair still looked terrific. This of all things has given me the hair I've dreamed of. And at $10-$15 per treatment, this price is right.<br /><br />Of course, it does smell terrible. And the fumes can sting your eyes, both as you apply it to your hair and as you iron it out. I like to open the back door and aim a cyclonic fan into the bathroom while I use this stuff so I don't choke on the fumes.",

    "text": "Since there aren't any reviews for this product, I thought I would write one for those who aren't familiar with the brand, or the item. I'm now 66 years old and have been using only La Prairie products for my face since 2009/10. My face looks better than ever because of it. This item in particular is a very gentle, easy to apply and use, facial cleanser that doesn't require any water or actual washing process. It goes on a cotton pad (not the balls!), and not too much either, and you gently wipe your face and eye lids going in a circular motion - and always apply outwards and upwards. This will help your skin from being pulled down, which can cause more wrinkles. The company has changed the exact name of the product, but it's the same (only an improved version) as it always has been. For me, I use this as the first step in my nightly facial ritual - which is to cleanse the face. I follow with other products in stages, finishing up with the moisturizer (one for the face and a different one for the eyes). My rating of this being sold online is hard, since it's a wonderful product, however it's outrageously overpriced for what's a ‘trial size' and ‘free' gift, given out with purchases of a full size La Prairie item (depending on how much you spend, and where you buy, it might be just one of multiple free trial size items). The FULL size of this item is about $100 USD, and it's around 8 ounces +/-. The bottle is probably 8” high and a couple inches wide at least. So part of my rating is based on the product itself and the other part is on the price for this size. Another thing I want to mention is that I have sensitive skin and have never had any issues with this product line! You're face will thank you!",

The peony has a distinctive smell to it but unfortunately it doesn't last long enough after taking a shower. The bar is a large oval shape and a little awkward to use at first - it gets easier as it's used more. The design of this and other products from MDW is very pretty and would make a nice gift for someone too. The soap has a LOT of creamy lather that that rinses clean and doesn't leave much soap scum on the shower walls. I have tried other triple milled soaps from L'Occitaine, Pre de Provence, Australian Soap Works, and 2 others that I can't readily recall the name of. All these are similar in price but the quality of this is much better, at least in my opinion. I have found that some fragrances are a bit stronger than others and I think it's just a matter of choosing one over another according to preference. This company makes so many different things for the kitchen and bath and I have bought quite a number of them for myself and plan on buying more for gifts. I noticed one review of this scent that said it had an awful smell to it, whereas mine is good - unfortunately this can happen if the bar is old and depending on the seller. This doesn't mean that every bar of soap is bad! My only negative comment is that the peony scent doesn't last long enough!",

In my opinion all of La Prairie's products are excellent and worth the high price - I don't use makeup so it's important for me to make my face look as good as it can be. I'm 61 years old and have been using this line for about 7 years. Depending on skin type and age I think some of their products work better than others.

So I wanted something that was more user friendly.  But then on an impulse I cut my naturally curly hair very short.<br /><br />The Pros:  It seems sturdy and well-made with a nice grain.  It's smooth (the teeth on the plastic picks tend to splinter and peel with time).  It feels comfortable to use.  It probably has good stay power.<br /><br />The Cons:  By far the biggest for me is that the teeth are spaced much more widely apart and are much thicker than I expected from the photo.  This means you can't really get the curl definition that the picks with a more narrow spacing will give you.  I also wish the handle were a bit longer.",

I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I'm dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it's messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine.  I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  Based on my experience, I'd have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don't work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning).  Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.)  Leaves me to wonder if the gray hairs would not be gray had I followed the advice of the other henna/indigo distributors.  Here's a good reference website:  [...]",

I personally think that's a positive! Then again, it may not be noticeable once you get them on. UPDATE: I still think they are beautiful but there are a couple of issues. 1 they snag on everything! I am not a pro so I'm working on ways to gel them without making my nail real thick. 2. they bend real easy, again, completely encasing them in gel solves the issue but I'm not fond of the look.

That could have just be because in the pictures it does seem to have dark undertones but there are none.  26 inches I beg to differ, I think this wig was about a 22 inches. It had no weight to it. It was over processed and shed. the hairs coming off at the actual bulb part, where they stitch it on to the cap and it was so thin towards the bottom I'm guessing because it was over processed while being colored. I have never left a bad review but after spending almost 200 dollars I figured I'd at least give someone the heads up before they go in on this wig. Blonde colored wigs are more expensive, I understand because they have to dye them, but this one just lost the entire mark. and just FYI the wig cap is biigggggggg.....I will not be returning it. I'll cut my losses and stick to my normal brands.  I re-dyed it, re styled it and even cut it. I hate returning, so I will use it one of my, home wigs.  Very disappointed.",

I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is. Especially shaving around the throat.  I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  I gave it a try.  The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn't last long at all.  One reviewer wrote that he uses regular shave gel. I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  I used that as if I was using a razor.  It works great.  Just rinse it off the shaver during shaving and after you finish, while the power is on. Since this shaver is made to use in the shower, using regular shave cream and rinsing the shaver doesn't cause any problem.  Given the price of razor blades, it won't bother me to spend $30 for replacement blades when needed.  I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn't give it 5 stars.  Buy the shaver, then using the much cheaper gel that you slap on your face.",

    "title": "A Surreal Dreamy Experience – Say Goodbye to Anxiety and Hello to Confidence!",
    "text": "Today I tried out Liquid Trust for the first time. I put some on before getting in the car with my husband. He sort of looked over at me at one point but I don't think he knew why. Two sprays on my wrists was all it took to see real effects. It made me feel sort of dreamy and not talkative. Like I just felt very relaxed and happy. We did not argue in the car for the first time in weeks probably because I was not talking up a storm as usual.<br /><br />People at the grocery store seemed to be smiling at me as I was walking around pushing my cart. I will say smiling may be an effect because when I saw my husband walking down the hallway at home before we left I smiled spontaneously and felt very happy to see him.<br /><br />My cat Wolfie thinks I'm great now too and when he smelled this on my wrists he got really affectionate and marked my wrists with his cheeks. A sure sign of approval.<br /><br />This has a slight powdery musky scent if anything. It is barely noticeable and my husband who hates me to wear perfumes did not complain at all! The ingredients are SD alcohol, purified water and oxytocin.<br /><br />So I feel this oxytocin perfume calmed down my anxiety in general which made other people around me more open and friendly.<br /><br />To be honest this was a surreal and dreamy experience. I felt calm, yet open and loving and very relaxed. When I keep sniffing my wrists after using it I feel a sort of calmly ecstatic in love feeling.<br /><br />I'd say this is the real thing. It also did not cause any sensual feelings and no one was attracted to me or me to them, this just reduced anxiety and made me more accepting. I did notice however that I was hyper aware of every man in the store. So it must trigger some protective elements in the brain.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to married couples who are looking to deepen their intimacy and who want to stop being irritated with each other and get along better.<br /><br />I avoided anyone pregnant while wearing this as advised!<br /><br />I am not a doctor nor is this review medical advice. Please consult with your doctor before using. I also don't advise using this for nefarious or deceitful purposes because the karma would not be good! Use at your own risk!<br /><br />For people in love in a committed marriage relationship, this Liquid Trust can help keep you calm when needing to talk. I'd suggest both people wearing the perfume on their wrists. The scent is sort of unisex and not overly strong. Very mild really, barely noticeable.<br /><br />So a good experience and it does what it says it is supposed to do. The anti-anxiety or anti-cortisol effects are very apparent. Don't you just need a break from stress now and then? Now you can spay this on your wrists and sit down and feel dreamy, happy and secure. For some confidence might be a nice side effect. That is probably why salespeople use this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

    "text": "If you are looking for Harvest themed movies the first two in this collection are perfect. Harvest Love is about a woman who find herself again when she goes home for a vacation. The love story has the usual conflict at the start but the characters fall in love slowly and with a lot of restraint. No kissing until right at the end! Made me want to try pear desserts. Harvest Love is very innocent but has a little romantic dancing at a festival. I'd say it should be rated PG for this.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie Wars was really cute and I loved that the women in the movie all ended up friends again in the end. Basically you have two best friends who have a falling out and it takes years for them to even speak to each other again. The happy ending in this can't be beat! Plus lots of baking competitions and romance. A little kissing but that is it.<br /><br />Truly Madly Sweetly made me feel uncomfortable for the most part because the characters were always in conflict. While the ending is happy I just felt like I would probably not watch it again. I don't mind when characters don't like each other at the start, but to be fighting for different goals basically the whole movie was not as enjoyable to watch. I also wondered what would really happen in their circumstance if the ex wife decided she wanted her husband back. It all felt a bit too risky for me.<br /><br />But no violence, swearing or anything objectionable in any of the movies. The G rating seems true for the last two of the movies at least. PG for Harvest Love.<br /><br />And I must admit my big strong husband came and sat right next to me while I was watching Harvest Love. These movies are enjoyable for men to watch too. Apparently. ;)))) He watched all three. But his question was...\"Why are all these movies the same just with different actors?\" I told him they are just what women love to watch over and over again. It is the romance we crave. So we enjoy watching two characters fall in love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

Otherwise you get a sort of yellow tanned look that takes a bit to rub in and disappear.

So you can see how healing this also is. I don't notice any scent from the oil it seems relatively mild. I think this bottle is going to last me a long time since I use so little of it.

Yes, I guess it does have a banana scent and the texture is similar to a banana cream pie topped with whipped cream.<br /><br />To say this is decadent is an understatement. You will be very tempted to slather your entire body in a good helping of this cream. Fortunately, it goes a long way and absorbs extremely well. In fact, that is why they call it \"vanishing\" crème. The ingredient list is impressive and contains rose water, mango butter, beeswax, grapeseed oil, rosehip seed oil, Vitamin E, marshmallow extract, willowbark extract, calendula flower extract, and a heady fragrance.<br /><br />Grapeseed oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants and is high in proanthocyanidins, a group of bioflavonoids that are superior because they are water soluble. This ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure.<br /><br />\"Marsh Mallow\" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows. It has been used for centuries as a food and a medicine. The leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with healing properties for inflamed skin. In the past, people boiled the roots in wine to make a cough remedy.<br /><br />I found this luscious creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind. Not only will you feel comforted by nature, your skin will be baby soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing. The silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal. If you love this product, you might want to try the Pore-refining mask, Evening Primrose Overnight Crème and the very unique parsley blemish stick. To take luxury to the next level, try the Shea Butter Decollete Crème on your feet, hands or all over your entire body. What an amazing line of products. They heal, protect and soothe your mind.<br /><br />I'm still trying all the Burt's Bees products, and love how these products make me feel.

    "text": "I use fractioned oils to make rollerballs for my oil blends and for a carrier for various topical uses.<br />I have been wanting to recreate a muscle cramp relief oil from a major essential oil club and lucked up with a copycat recipe.  These oils are over $30 for 5ml and, while it works great and smells amazing, I just couldn't bring myself to spend that knowing that I have a box full of single oils.<br />When I saw this bottle with the pump, I knew it was time to try my hand and mixing this recipe.  I had a few other rollerballs that I wanted to make (some decongestant and immune boosters since it's getting to that time of year) so I inserted the pump and got to work.  The oils mixed VERY well and the pump on the bottle made it very easy to dispense just enough into the small rollerball opening.  That is SUCH a nice feature – manufacturer, please don't remove that from the item.  I can't tell you how many times I've spilled my fractioned oil everywhere because it was difficult to contain since it's thin.<br />Once I had worked through the 5 rollerballs for my family needs, I had enough room in the bottle to make a BIG batch of the massage oil with the rest of the fractioned oil.  IT WORKED!!!  I'm soooooo happy with this bottle of fractioned oil.  I can easily pump out what I need to work out my sore muscles and apply to hubby's back (he has scholosis and other degenerative issues).  I would highly recommend for anyone wanting to use fractioned oil for their essential oil uses.<br />I have opted to test products as a hobby and thus, received this product at a reduced price in order to fully test the product offered. I have not been paid to leave a review but simply received a discount to test the product for flaws or issues.  This review is of my own words and using my firsthand experience with the product. If I like it, I like it, if I don't, that is reflected in my reviews.  I have written this review as if I paid full price for the product and is not biased due to the discount.

My eye doctor has prescribed all kinds of expensive drops for allergies, inflammation, dry eyes, scratched corneas, etc. This has done more in 5 days than anything else. I'm not sure why this wasn't considered by my doctor long ago. Kinda upsetting, but I'm glad I found it eventually on my own.<br />BE CAREFUL, it can burn your eyes if gotten inside. I scrub each eye separately with cotton pad. I have a wet rag ready to wipe off excess. Repeat with a new cotton pad to the other eye. If you do both at the same time, you might lose the washcloth because you can't open your eyes before rinsing. The price was attractive enough to not try and make it myself.

Some of the sandwiches are already pulling apart and do not feel sticky. The hair itself smelled slightly synthetic while I styled it, and I noticed the ends bubbled up with heat application like synthetic would. I also noticed several strands of super thick, plastic-feeling pieces. I pulled one off the weft and it snapped apart like it was plastic. Tried to take a picture of the bubbled ends as well as one of the thick pieces.<br /><br />I've used other inexpensive brands that have had better tape, and don't mind synthetic when you know it's what you'll get. I will probably take these out and return them as-is or have to buy better tape to fix them.",

After rubbing my eyes since the last night, the top lashes held and I didn't wake up with raccoon eyes. however, it does flake a bit.

I love the long chiseled pencil shape because it makes it easier to apply straight stokes of color to my very thin brows without looking drawn on or penciled in. However, it does skip a bit compared to my gel brow color that is applied with a brush. The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx. It works, it stays and looks great. Gals with thicker brows will reap the most benefit b using the mascara type brush for the most natural look and pigment distribution.",

The next day, I went to try it again and realized that the outer layer of the silicone applicator had peeled off on the back.  The inside of the applicator is very sticky, so that rendered that one useless.  I figured it was a dud and tried the next one, The same exact thing happened! I was using very light pressure and rinsed with water after each use. Additionally, my foundation is made for sensitive skin and is very eco friendly. so I know that there is no way that the foundation eroded the applicator.

I'll admit there are times when you are going out and the outfit that you choose would look great with some color to your skin.  Well, that is why I purchased this self tanning lotion and thought I would give it a try.  We are now in the winter months in New England so I chose to test this product on my mid section and abdomen where it would not show if this was a flop!<br />Much to my surprise I now have a bronze belly!<br />The lotion is a good size bottle of 8.5 ounces and is a very army green color when dispensed.  Be sure to wear a disposable glove when applying or yes, your palms will turn bronzed.<br />I applied this sparingly as the directions stated and waited two hours and I am impressed with the color and that there is no streaking.  I have since showered several times and reapplied and the results are great.  I am very anxious to be able to do this in the warmer weather and have a good looking tan for the first time in years.",

I have long hair and put my hair up in a clip under the shower cap. Depending on where I put the clip and what size it is, the cap can be a little tight or can fit perfectly.

    "text": "I originally purchased this eyeliner at a Kohls department store for my daughter for her to practice with makeup. However, I ran out of my regular eyeliner one day and I had to use I had to use hers. It was soooo AMAZING that I immediately went to Amazon to see if they had and to my pleasant surprise, they did.<br /><br />It glides on with ease, its true to color and doesn't lighten after application. Its EXTREMELY precise and beyond easy to use. It is by far genuinely the EASIEST liquid eyeliner I have used in my 25plus years of using liquid liners. The felt tip is more hardened which makes its SUPER easy to control and place on the eyelid, whereas other liquid liners have softer felt tips which are floppy and they bend easy leaving you with having to press lightly so you don't mess up your straight line. This E.L.F liner is opposite of ALL that, its hard but not TOO hard that it doesn't glide precisely with your stroke. It has a PERFECT sized super thin tip which allows me to give my cat eye a precise small line finish at the corner of eye, it's perfection!<br /><br />My most FAVORITE part of this liquid eyeliner is that it does NOT get cakey, if I want a thicker more pronounced look, I can go over the same line several times and it doesn't cake up. I mean sure if you're gonna put 10 layers on, I'm sure it'll eventually cake, but building  with 3 layers, no cake! First time I tried to do thicker line, I was so nervous not wanting to mess up my entire eye makeup, but I had faith and gave it a try and was SHOCKED that it didn't get thick and cakey, and it still looked like I only had 1 layer of eyeliner on.<br /><br />Did I mention it stays put! I'll sometimes get watery eyes in the corner of my eyes, and this magic liner doesn't smudge, doesn't rub off, it could be that my make up setting spray helps, or it could be the eyeliner, but whatever it is its definitely some sort of sorcery. Haha.... But regardless with the insanely affordable price, you WON'T be disappointed!!!<br /><br />It removes SUPER easy with make up remover, or just soap and water, I always wash my face, then use make up remover to get any remaining make up off, and the eyeliner always seems to be gone after just soap and water.<br /><br />Truly the best bang for your buck!!!!",

I opened it up and it looks like whipped mashed potatoes which is a little odd and didn't really smell like anything (it's unscented which is good); not pleasant or unpleasant. I decided to try it on myself first before trying it on my child. When the seasons change I get super bad dry skin on the tops of my hands that ends up itching, burning, and becoming scaly. As the weather has been cold the last week, my hands started to flare up. It only took TWO applications of this in one day to stop the itch and burning and start to heal my skin.<br /><br />I used it for my daughter the first time this week as well and after one overnight after the cream, the slight redness she had was gone. I would definitely recommend this and will be purchasing more in the future!<br /><br />Best features:<br />Huge container<br />Works fast<br />Super moisturizing<br /><br />Possible improvements:<br />It is slightly oily until it soaks in and dries<br />Scent (maybe something natural like coconut oil would help this?)",
