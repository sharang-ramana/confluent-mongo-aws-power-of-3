I think they need a new name for the scent and a new package. Such a weak print design vs. most of their other soaps.  And what does a Flamingo have to do with this soap?",

    "text": "This is an extremely moisturizing cream that my 4a/4b hair absolutely drinks up!! My hair is extremely dry after washing and letting it air dry (even though I always add a leave-in and oil). So, I decided to use this to help moisturize and twist my hair. I could just feel my hair going from super dry to extremely soft and moisturized from just one application of each section! I also applied this over castor oil, which I applied to my hair beforehand. (I use the L.O.C. moisturization method).<br /><br />I then twisted my hair and applied this generously (my twist outs always come out better when I'm more generous with my product of choice). After 10 hours or so, I took out my twists and had a very well-defined twist out! There was absolutely no frizz - even after separating each twist (I undo the twist and the split each section in half). I'm really happy with the results.<br /><br />The pics I'm included are of a two-day-old twist out  (I forgot to take a pic on the first day) and my hair still looks great - a little frizzy from sleeping on it, but nothing horrible. I just spritzed on a little leave-in conditioner to refresh my hair and it looked just as good as the first day. This cream is wonderful and allows me to easily go 4-5 days on one twist out - something that many other products just don't do for my hair.<br /><br />This has a really sweet, pleasant smell to it. It's a white cream that's on the thick side, but very easy to work with and absorbs nicely into the hair - doesn't just sit on top. I also love that it doesn't make my hair feel all crunchy or crispy. My twist out was really soft and my curls were bouncy. Thanks to providing great hold, amazing definition, and complete hydration for dry, frizzy hair, you can't get wrong using this product!<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% mine.",

Am only relating my experience. When reading the contents, I noted that it contains a tiny bit of lanolin, which, of course, works wonders for all kinds of minor skin problems.

I've gotten so many compliments while wearing this, and being told I smell good is probably one of my favorite compliments haha.<br /><br />Great value, lasts pretty long, and smells amazing!",

It, to me, is messy and if I use the unwaxed floss, it gets caught in my teeth.  I will use it from time to time, but mainly I use these after every meal and they work perfectly to remove plaque and other build-up.  My dental hygienist even remarked at how little work she has to do to remove plaque at my 6 month check-ups and I really believe that it is due to proper brushing, of course, but these brushpicks as well.  My dentist and the hygienist always ask me how often I floss and my same response is that I use the brushpicks and not floss.

The Latisse took a couple of months before it really started to work. But there's a lot of side effects with Latisse, like dry eye and then you get these little white heads some times, and you can get dark circles under your eyes, even if you put Vaseline under your eyes after apply. And let's not forget the price of Latisse. I have tried four different lash growing items from Amazon, this is the only one that grew my lashes a little bit, but then they fell out and all my lashes all short again.

You'll need to use 2+ heads per time you floss.  Additionally, the angle of the flosser makes using the ribbon head floss exceedingly difficult - if it were 90 degrees like the Listerine version, it would be way better.  Because of the angle, you'll need to open your mouth extremely wide to floss your molars with the ribbon floss.

I can surely fit all my round medium sized compacts on one shelf as well. It's sturdy and very well put together.

I am not convinced there is always serum coming out while rolling it on because the nature of steel is that it feels cool to the touch, therefore can give the impression of depositing serum when, in fact, it isn't.  To determine this I ran it over white tissue several times; only about 50% of the time did serum actually come out.  I removed and cleaned the steel roller ball as directed then reran my \"experiment\" and had the same results.<br /><br />During application I can briefly detect a damp look where it is being deposited, but this goes away within seconds.  At other times nothing is on the surface of my face and immediate dabbing with a tissue proves there is no serum.  I am not convinced this is the best mode of application.<br /><br />If, after a couple of months of use, I see definite wrinkle reduction I will happily update my review accordingly.",

    "text": "Pre-pandemic my hubby would go get his hair trimmed before it got too long. During lockdown and beyond, he didn't want to risk getting sick for a hair cut since I'm high risk. So he decided so long as he's working at home, he was just going to let it grow to enjoy longer hair while he could. As it got longer he started asking me how I people with longer hair tie their hair back without getting a headache. I told him we don't. Then got offered this for review so I snatched it up.<br /><br />It helps a lot because it's not a solid band, so you can sort of tighten it and/or take it off without yanking half of your hair with it. Takes a little tweaking and getting used to. Not sure how it would hold up to more complicated styles, but for just holding your hair back in a pony tail, it's pretty decent.",

They're not horrible, but I 100% notice them and have to readjust these often.  I have that issue with a lot of fabric headbands though.<br /><br />I do love the prints and they're well made. I will keep them but I wouldn't re-order them. I suspect I'll end up tearing out the knot and re-sew it to be just a wide headband instead, I think they'll fit me better and not slide around as much that way.<br /><br />Overall: if you find you can wear most fabric headbands without issue, you'll love these. If you find this style of headband is a gamble where some fit awesome and others slide around or if you have a larger head, these will probably not be your faves.",

As someone with thin, fine hair that has been kept short for years, I think it may be almost too much hair for me.  I may have to trim it some so that it won't feel so overpowering.  The hair itself looks decent enough that it could probably be  a daily wig for most.",

    "text": "I'm posting a pic of my hair pre-bleach, post bleach, and post pink dye. I probably didn't need to bleach it but the last time I tried to dye my hair with pinks (two different brands) it just didn't take very well.<br /><br />This took very well. The kit includes all you need (I used different gloves just because I prefer others). The directions are simple and complete. I would say that if you have hair longer than chin, maybe shoulder length, you will need at least two boxes. I have a pixie cut and used about half of both the bleach and dye. I always follow the direction when bleaching and did follow their directions. I never follow directions when using these &#34;Direct dye&#34; bright colors. Instead of the 30-60 minutes, I left mine in for 5 hours. I got a very vibrant pink (a little more fuchsia than the pictures on the box).<br /><br />My one complaint is that this definitely left me with more dye rubbing off than some other brands have. When I used other brands I might wake up the next morning to a streak light on my pillow and that was with lot of hair. Using this on short hair, my pillow looked like a pink paintball fight happened. This and all dyes like it will dye anything and everything they touch. So I highly recommend two things - 1. protect everything (your skin around your face and neck with Vaseline) 2. If possible do NOT rinse your hair in a shower/bathtub. If you have access to a stainless steel sink or some kind of utility / laundry room sink where stains won't matter, that is so much easier to clean.",

    "text": "I got this wig yesterday and wore it to a family event and some people didn't know it was a wig. The color is about as dark as my hair would be if I dyed it soft black, which I do sometimes. The curls are a little on the POC side (not the curl type/pattern necessarily, but rather the volume at the root) so I found that bobby pinning some bits down in the back or wearing a headband helped it look more natural for a pale jewish girl. The hair is very soft and doesn't irritate me like my synthetic wigs. However, I think they sent me the wrong length, but I'm not upset about it - for a human hair wig that's this versatile (read: can be worn by a white girl) this price is really great and I understand that on their end things might be hectic. I got a bad haircut a week ago and wasn't able to leave my house, was super depressed, crying all the time when i saw a mirror. This wig is a great solution as the semester is starting in one week and I absolutely have to be on campus. It's less hot than other wigs I have, and I feel confident that this looks natural enough to pass as I start meeting new people at my new school. One thing though is that the wig I received is NOT lace front. Since I gave it full bangs, that doesn't really matter, and I don't care that much about that in general because I will make sure to have bangs with any wig, but I thought it would be lace front and it would have been my first so I was disappointed it wasn't. If you're looking for only lace front, skip this one. But overall I'm giving it 5 stars because I really can't imagine the quality for the price being any better than this.",

And I liked the color in the photo, too, even though I am a chestnut.  But the wig and the hair color are not anywhere near what is advertised.  The style is flat in the back, not adorable like it is the profile photo.  The color is more strawberry red with ugly flat cream colored highlights: not blond.  I tried styling it with the curling iron and it didn't seem to take the curl.  But I had the iron on the lowest setting, because I didn't want to burn the wig.<br /><br />It can't go back, so I'm stuck with it.  I'll either donate it to our local theatre group or I'll try cutting it and restyling the cut. I don't think it will hold hair dye because it's synthetic, but I'm going to give it a try when I re-dye my natural hair. What can I lose.  I can't wear it anyhow.<br /><br />I also bought a Vivica Fox Moore wig and it's great.",

It makes the bag a bit more adjustable if you wish to include a mirror, makeup wipes or even a small flat bag with a few makeup items for on the go.<br /><br />The brushes all have a wooden handle that feels wooden and not plastic or overly painted. The piece in the center that hold the brush to the handle is fermly attached and does not wiggle or feel loose or missed sized at all. The bush brissles themselves and soft and gental on your skin while still being ferm enough to sweep the makeup exactly in the spot you mint for it to go.<br /><br />Most of the brushes are cut in a tapered cut and only one was blunt excluding the eyebrow brush. There are a few strans on a few of the brushes that needs a quick trimming but this does not cause a problem to do.<br /><br />The hairs do not shed and fall out even if you were to pull the extra few longer hairs out. I have only seen maybe 4 hairs comeout even after pulling on them to check or while brushing them across my face.<br /><br />Each brush is packages with a plastic sleave to protect the brushes. this plastic can be tossed out. Some of the brushes has a more thick plastic on the brissles themselves to protect them and these are reusable.<br /><br />My lipstick brush was damidged when I got it. The harder plastic cap had bent back half the hair and they would not straiten back out. I did call and ask for a return because I really needed this brush. Once I send it out, I do plan to get a second to replace the one I am having to send back. It is a great quality.<br /> Update, I googled a lot of ways to fix your brushes. There had to be a way to fix it.  since it was the only flaw in the entire Bset, I had already opened it and even used it before I even noticed the damage brush I  wanted to give a shot at not having to return my product. I tried out a few  things to fix the bristles. I found that wedding them, wrapping them in tissue then taping it together  or just use saran wrap, I left it overnight and the  here's were straightened the next day. I really wanted to give this kit a shot because it is such great quality. It was also a great price. I am glad I was able to fix it without having to return it.",

    "text": "I am a sucker for any product that claims to straighten hair.  Against my better judgment, I ordered this product, and sure enough, it doesn't work well.  The metal base heats up quick, but the way the brush is designed, it can't get at the roots of the hair.  So the first 2-3&#34; of the hair shaft remains pouffy while the rest of the hair gets more or less straight.  A hair iron works much more efficiently.  Learn from my mistake, and save your money.  You don't need this product.",

You have to test the products on your skin first to make certain you have no allergic reactions before using them. I thought the glue pen is just an adhesive and the eyeliner pen, as with all false eyelash eyeliner pens was magnetic, but I was wrong. The glue and eyeliner seem to be both magnetic. You have to wait until both are completely dry before applying the lashes, as the magnetic properties are what keep your lashes on. The 5 pairs of lashes are all very lovely and there is something for every occasion from work to play to dress up. I wish it had been made more clear that these are magnetic lashes, as I only use glue adhesive lashes, and only hypo allergenic glues to protect my eyes. To remove these lashes with the magnetic liner or adhesive on your eyes, you need a good liquid make up remover and cotton pads.

This wig immediately reminded me of Sleeping Beauty's gorgeous long curls and color. These curls are absolutely divine in both the ends and bangs. Truly a magnificent princess wig. There are elastic bands at the back of the wig to make it fit any size head. It will fit a small to large head with these clip elastic adjustments. Should the wig be too large for a really young, small child, you can always stitch it closer in the back on the inside. A couple stitches has made any wig tighter, and you can always remove the stitches for a larger child. However, I found the elastic straps hook really tight or looser, so I didn't have a need for that. The curls are layered for a stunning effect. I love the bangs having those same large curls for a true princess look. The color is a light and gold blonde mix- just gorgeous. This is one beautiful wig for play or costume. 5 STARS.",

The fragrances rated by me are based on my years spent working in a cosmetic factory. I will list each fragrance separately.<br /><br />ARROGANT- With top notes of bergamot and cedar you get a woodsy freshness to the scent. The middle notes of coriander and lavender bring a warm, clean freshness. At the base are sandalwood, amber and musk bringing a warm, sensual, spicy scent. All together, you get a spicy, warm, woodsy scent with a distinctive freshness to it. This light, sensual scent lasts all day and smells wonderful on almost every man, so 5 STARS.<br /><br />OXFORD BLEU- The top notes of mint and lemon add a citrus freshness. The middle notes of iris and geranium bring a very light floral scent. The base adds sandalwood and vanilla for a woodsy delicious scent. All together, this scent is light, with an undertone bit of floral and clean citrus and a nice light woodsy smell. This light, woodsy fragrance smells fabulous on almost every man and does last long for 5 STARS.<br /><br />RIVIERA- With top notes of lemon, bergamot, lime and cedar, you get a refreshing citrus/woods scent. In the middle are jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, lavender and mandarin- most of these were used in the 60's sexy, warm, earthy scents. At the base notes are nutmeg and coumarin to add some spice. This is not for every man, but for a man who likes a more vibrant scent. These scents are very noticeable and not light, being a very woodsy, earthy, warm fragrance with a touch of zest. 4 STARS.<br /><br />NOTTING HILL- The top notes begin with bergamot, lemon and lime for a clean, natural scent. Then the middle notes have bolder peppercorn and jasmine bringing a rose/herbal scent. At the bottom are cedarwood, sandalwood, amber and a powdery musk for a very potent woodsy, animal musky scent. This is definitely not for every man being very heavy scents. There is nothing light about this fragrance. 4 STARS.<br /><br />With four interesting fragrances, two being light and two being heavy, every man is sure to find one he will like. Lighter scents always smell wonderful on almost every man and the bolder scents smell great on a man depending on how his chemistry goes with the bolder fragrances. 4 ½ STARS.",

    "text": "LaClaire Eye Firming Serum with Caffeine, Peptides, Botanicals - Best Treatment for Puffy Eyes, Wrinkles, Fine Lines (5 ml/0.5 oz) gave me immediate results in reducing puffiness from not sleeping well. I don't always get a good night's sleep and in the morning, the puffiness shows and sometimes dark circles accompany the puffiness.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum works unbelievably fast. The puffiness goes away within an hour. As for dark circles, they do fade out with daily use- you will notice a difference within a week. The main thing I noticed is a tighter, firmer feel of my under eye area. This tightening and firming of the delicate eye area actually does make fine lines disappear. Age spots don't disappear, but your skin will brighten up.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum is so easy to use. You simply apply a drop or two with the dropper and lightly dab into your skin with a finger. If you do this at night, you will wake up to a firmer skin and it looks brighter, but it's the feeling of firmness and tightness you will love. Applying a good moisturizer after the Eye Serum really makes your under eye skin look fabulous and feeling hydrated. Keeping the dropper clean after use will result in always having the serum perfect and moist with no dried out particles. Any Eye Serum that can immediately get rid of puffiness from a bad night's sleep and leave your skin around your eyes feeling firmer and tighter gets 5 STARS from me.",

    "text": "This Vaginal Moisturizer - Vulva Balm - USDA Organic Aloe Free & Natural Vaginal Cream - Intimate Skin Cream - Reduce Vaginal Dryness, Itching & Burning - Estrogen Free Treatment - V. Harmony (1) will relieve a multitude of irritations caused by many different issues. One of the main irritations are pads or tampons. Every month, especially for a heavy period, menstrual pads can cause painful irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching. Then when you are into menopause, the irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching are a hundred times worse, due to heavy periods that can last forever.<br /><br />There are many other issues that can cause constant irritations besides pads and tampons- if you've ever had a bad Urinary Tract Infection, where you are urinating frequently in pain, the rashes are unbearable. Having a weak bladder at times where you need a heavier pad or diaper causes more unpleasant rashes. It is so difficult to find a cream that will actually help with severe chafing, dryness, pain, itching and irritations. This V. Harmony Vaginal Moisturizer helps immensely with chafing and dryness. But when it comes to helping with severe rashes, itching and pain- make sure you refrigerate this first before applying, because you will be happy you did. Applying this cold is the best relief ever- the pain goes away immediately. Take the time to refrigerate the jar for maximum, instant relief! 5 STARS.",

It does turn to lock and unlock, but no matter what I did the pump did not work.  So in order for me to use it I have to unscrew the cap every time, pull the pump tube out, and wipe some product from the pump tube.

SO<br /><br />Pros<br />Easy to apply<br />Easy to remove<br />Drama without much hassle<br /><br />Cons<br />Heavy<br />Don't fit my eyelid quite right and are difficult to trim off excess<br /><br />TIPS<br />Apply your regular eyeliner first. If you use this eyeliner, it runs a bit and your lashes may not stick where they should. Do your regular liner design and then shake up the magnetic eyeliner and apply it where the lashes need to go. Apply, let dry, then apply again before putting the lashes on. Do NOT remove them to show anyone how easy it is, they pull the liner right off and won't go back on (yes I did this lmao)<br /><br />So, 5 star rating from me regardless of the cons. They're so fluffy and soft, and I expected magnets on my eyelids to be just a little heavy",

I also spray dry conditioner on cheap wigs to help prevent tangling & frizz but it doesnt tangle. The fibers are heavier than cheaper wigs & dont fly away. They all lays in place nicely. I tried it out around the house for he better part of the day & sweated some in it while cleaning & afterwards i cleaned & brushed it without any tangling or frizz. The cap is a little bit smaller than other wigs but it fits & I definitely like the material this wig is made with. I definitely will buy more, especially in different & longer styles.",

It hardly sheds and doesn't tangle like all the cheap synthetic wigs I've bought. It isn't real thick but not skimpy either.  I'm happy with it and just ordered the dark brown.",

They never last as long. I've even slept in this eyeliner and its still on when I wake up. If I rub my eyes it will smear some but not all off. I just wipe where I don't want it and I'm good to go. Even when my eyes water it stays on.Its also very easy to sharpen unlike some other wooden eyeliner. My local Wal-Mart's used to carry dark brown but don't anymore and are always sold out of the black so I was so excited to find it on Amazon. I ordered 3 of each and hopefully will be able to buy more.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:960b84058924153a7db27c4cc6448444]] I received three bundles from the company to install and wear (18\"/20\"/22\" straight hair weave bundles). The bundles arrived earlier than expected and I was pleased with the quality of the hair. I even got a nice pair of lashes with the hair.<br /><br />The hair itself was soft and the texture was nice and full. My stylist also said that she liked the hair as well and that the hair was soft and very pretty! I chose the quick weave method this time during my installation instead of sew-in. Women do however think it's my own hair because how well my stylist lays the tracks so close to each other. It's light and not heavy and looks quite natural!<br /><br />I've purchased several hair bundles from this company over the past years and the quality of hair I've received has been pretty consistent. The hair looks so natural and the compliments I receive when I use this hair are endless!<br />Try the hair yourself; the bundles are a great price in comparison to other companies and you'll look great wearing them!",

They are easy to use and unlike some other ones I've tried the whitening strips did not hurt my teeth.

I highly recommend these and you'll be surprised at the difference they make in just 2 weeks!",

It's a good, snug fit so the headband doesn't move around and no hair gets loose.<br /><br />Another thing I liked is that it's double wrapped, so the head band is clean and free of dust.

I do my best to stick to a regimented beauty routine, however due to my schedule - it is sometimes difficult because I travel so much of my time.  This product leaves my skin supple and extremely soft.  I appreciate the fact that it contains  Vitamin C and CoQ10 which my online research states is really goof for your skin.  This product provided a lot of hydration for my face.  I am certainly looking forward to using it this summer as I live in Florida (The Sunshine State) so I have to take extra care from the sun.  I used it primarily at night prior to going to bed. I followed the recommended directions for use and only applied a very thin layer all over my face and neck.  I left the product on my face for 15 minutes and removed it with a damp wash cloth.  The product came off of my face right away and didn't leave any residue.  I really liked this product.  I did receive this product for a discount in exchange for an honest review.",

I use other products with coconut oil and/or extract that keep my waves intact while boosting the body of my hair.  Product reviews need give particulars about the reactive process of the product along with including the  type of hair, if color processed and if they air dry or blow dry.  \"Works great\" does not tell the person reading the review anything about how or why the product worked for that person.  However, it does mislead the rest of us into thinking a product will work for anyone.  The review process needs to be changed to include proper descriptions of the customer's reasoning behind their review.

The adjustable guide is the best design that I have found. Far better than similar units that use multiple guides that can get lost, damaged and require additional storage space. The turbo function does work, it has enough high power that calling it &#34;turbo&#34; is not only cool but accurate. The charge/low battery lights function well. The vacuum functions well. I've tried other manufactures so called vacuum units and found that not only did they not work they were a total disappointment. This vacuum system works! Removing and installing the guide was a bit tricky at first but you get used to it. The single thing that I miss is the slide up mini trimmer. Frankly; I would rather have that than the vacuum. Still, I like this product and recommend it! I have had it about a year now and it still works perfect!<br /><br />Update: 3 years old and like new!<br /><br />Update: 5 years old, still like new! If it ever fails I'll be buying another Philips/Norelco.",

Edit: to Cindy: the powder from your callous builds up in a cup under the rotary n u have to easily take apart each time n blow it out or shake it, etc. I purchase 1 more when the came down in price. I love these things, much more than Amope. That's sand paper roll going around but these have such a good blade u have to use it responsibly or u can cut your feet, but so effective!!! If used properly!!!!  Go slow as some people have mentioned n be persistent. A couple times a week go over your feet for a few minutes. My feet were like that gentlemen's. I too was on my feet up to 16 hours a day. My feet cracked n bleed. The best moisturizer on market right now i think is Curel Hydratherapy. I have asked Derms at work n they usually say Curel. Vanicream is excellent but I find it too greasy. After using this device hydrate your feet n place cotton stockings on. Do this at bedtime too if it's really bad. I love this product, im sorry if some of u have had mechanical problems. I've used 4 of mine n I had one problem w the wire getting broken inside. I called the company n they sent out a new wire immediately. My feet are silky smooth!!  What a mess they were 15 years ago!!!!  TO JOE:  are u reviewing the correct product?  I have 4 of these because I loved them so much n never wanted to be without n u r describing this device incorrectly.  You do no charge this unit. It comes with an electrical cord like an iron n that provides electricity/power. There is no charging. I've had the 1st models n the last for sale models n I think I r reviewing a different device. Another edit!  The customer who said this isn't supposed to be an electric sander is correct.  Yes, it stops if too much pressure, it's suppose to. Another customer said the blade was not rough enuf. Yes, eventually u will need to replace blades, but metal against skin should last quite awhile. I bought several blades when they came down in price. The customers that don't like it seem to be using it incorrectly from the start n misunderstanding the mechanics of it.  It's really great n sad Amazon is not selling it right now.  I have gotten so many people on this device!!!!",

Much better than a zip-lock sandwich bag. Highly recommend, especially for anyone who wants to use only carry-on luggage instead of checking their bags.<br /><br />Liquid prescription/OTC medications and other prescription items, such as contact lenses (and lens solution) are generally exempt from the TSA's 3-1-1 liquids rule for liquids, gels, aerosols, creams and pastes (3.4 oz bottle or less; 1 quart-sized, clear, plastic, zip-top bag; 1 bag per passenger), and can be packed in a separate bag; you just have to pull them out for inspection with your quart-sized bag.

I use it with the CND CuticleAway Cuticle Remover gel, and it works just as expected.  The nail cleaner end is a nice touch - I prefer this style to the ones that have flat or split trimmer blade ends.<br /><br />One caveat - the edge on the pusher end is sharp - you need to be careful of the pressure and angle used which pushing your cuticles back, as holding the tool at the wrong angle and/or using too much pressure may result in damage to the top layer of your nail (e.g. the tool may shave a slight bit off). I used my Dremel with a fine sanding bit to dull the edge on the pusher end; this resolved the issue for me. If you don't have a Dremel, I suggest taking an emery board to smooth the sharp end before use in order to avoid damaging your nail.<br /><br />I paid FULL price for this cuticle pusher, and did not receive any incentives or discounts in exchange for this review.",
