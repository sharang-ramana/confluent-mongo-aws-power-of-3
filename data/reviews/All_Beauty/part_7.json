This cushion was no help at all, because the foam was so squishy that it completely flattened out the instant I tried to sit on it.  My tailbone was subjected to the same issues of compression and pain that I have with no cushion at all.  In fact, it actually made the problem worse, because the foam in this cushion has so little substance that it crawled around underneath me and bunched up under my bottom, creating a large, uncomfortable lump right at the site of the pain!  I desperately needed a cushion made of dense, firm, high quality foam, and this is simply not up to that standard.  I returned it immediately.<br /><br />The fortunate thing is that the seller was easy to deal with, and was both cheerful and prompt with my refund.  THEY EVEN REFUNDED MY RETURN SHIPPING!  So, even though I cannot recommend this specific product, I would not hesitate to recommend the seller for anything else they are marketing on Amazon.<br /><br />I am sorry that I cannot give anyting better than one star to this cushion, but it really was worse than nothing for my particular problem.  I am just glad that Amazon gives me the chance to review the seller's actions in a seperate forum.  I was happy to give Cosmetic Solutions the highest rating possible!",

I am a little older than my fiance but I didn't want my face to show it on my special day. I take the best care of my skin to try to keep it as youthful as possible, so when I had the opportunity to try this serum, I was happy to do so. The serum comes in a screw top and eye dropper dispenser. The bottle is a dark amber colored glass bottle. There is one fluid ounce in the bottle. The serum has a sort of medicinal scent, not unpleasant and not too strong. It leave behind no real scent once it absorbs in. The serum feels refreshing and absorbs quickly and thoroughly into my skin. I feel an immediate pleasant tightening effect and the skin looks smooth and supple almost immediately. I've been using the stone crop serum for two weeks which is not really enough time to be able to tell the full effect of the serum on fine lines and wrinkles, but I do notice softening in expression lines in my forehead and in fine lines and that my skin stays better hydrated throughout the day. There is no burning, redness or irritation with the use of the serum and no product residue left behind. The manufacturer offers a 100% Money-Back Guarantee which I appreciate but have never had a problem with Eva Naturals products before. I am enjoying the serum and consider it a good value at under 19.00 delivered to my door and by the fact that a little goes a long way with only one dropper full of serum enough to do my entire face.",

I want to look good for as long as I can and because of that I've often used Vitamin C serums. I know they are effective and help with aging skin a lot,  My skin has always been a challenge. I have oily skin with large pores and sometimes have uneven and dull skin. I also have some expression lines on my forehead. I wanted to start using this serum as soon as I got it home. The serum comes in a very nice bottle which I like a lot because not only is it pretty but the serum is delivered in an airless pump which distributes exactly the right amount of serum to my fingertips for easy application to my face. Since Vitamin C products are easily oxidized I appreciate the product being dispensed this way so that it protects the serum and keeps it effective. I have been using this serum the morning on cleansed skin after toner, and then again at night before moisturizer on clean skin in the same way. The serum has a nice scent that is not overpowering and it only takes a pump or two of the serum to cover my entire face. The serum doesn't feel greasy or oily and it's just the right consistency to spread easily. There was no burning or irritation with this product, and it absorbs well into my skin with no left over residue. My skin feels smooth, silky and refreshed after I apply this serum as if my face has a refreshing blast of moisture. It looks supple and moisturized for hours and I've noticed my makeup stays on better. I have been using the serum for about two weeks now. Since then I have noticed a lot of amount of improvement in the tone and smoothness of my skin. It doesn't look as dull  and my skin also looks firmer. My skin is more radiant and soft and the expression lines in my forehead appear a little softer and the improved clarity of my skin is noticeable. My skin also looks better when I'm not wearing makeup. My skin has improved a little and I've been asked what had I been doing to make my skin look better? That makes me feel more confident that the serum is working. I am going to continue to use this serum and consider it a good value worth every penny of the asking price here since a little goes a long way.",

    "text": "[[ASIN:B01ETWZRL6 # Single For Men, Eau De Toilette 3.3 Fl. Oz./ 100 ml - Inspired By The One Cologne]]<br /><br />I was looking for new scents or signature scents for my future husband and wanted to try this. I like and appreciate the scent of The One Colognes so this was one I wanted my fiance (Bobby) try this scent. Buying signature scents can become quite expensive to say the least and this is a way for us to get an idea of what a scent smells like with Bobby's chemistry without spending thirty five or forty dollars and then not like it. Besides if this cologne scent stays on and lasts a while we may opt to purchase the less expensive cologne. The seller delivered very quickly and we received packaged well. Since this cologne is an Eau De Toilette Spray, it will have slightly more of the oils (10%) that make the spray smell great than just cologne which has about 7% oil. The scent also is delivered in a convenient spray which me and Bobby both like. The cologne actually smells very nice on him. It's a sort of woodsy, citrus masculine scent and you can definitely smell oranges and ginger in it. The One Cologne describes the scent as &#34;Coriander, Grapefruit, Cardamom seed, Tobacco, Basil, Cedar, Ambre, Ginger, Orange Blossom.&#34; Some of those things I have no idea what they smell like, but I'd say this not really a musk based scent but it smells really yummy on Bobby. It takes a little more spray than the original version The One Cologne, however, it's about 1/3 the cost, so I won't complain. It's still pretty strong with a couple of sprays being all he needs. As far as wear, it lasts a long time. It's sensual/manly in it's scent and he said he received several complements on the cologne. It is also a large bottle at 3.3 ounces delivered to the door for under 15.00. We like the cologne and can recommend it.",

Oz. / 85 ml - Inspired By Pink Friday By Nicki Minaj Perfume]]<br /><br />I have been trying several different parfums and body sprays to help me find a new fresh scent or to come up with my own signature scent by combining two or three scents or wearing one scent alone. The seller does a fabulous job of packaging and delivering quickly. The parfum is very pretty in it's design in a feminine bottle with a curved feminine design that's cute on my dresser or vanity. I like this parfum. It has a sort of delicious smelling fruity scent that is very inviting, but you can also smell musk and a slight hint of sweet floral undertones like jasmine. The scent is nice and soft and doesn't bother or irritate my senses. The scent is not overpowering. It's super difficult to explain how scents smell but all I can say is it really does smell fantastic and it does stay on for a pretty good while. I like how the scent sort of softens and mellows when I wear it a while. It lasts a lot longer if I spray it on my wrist and other pulse points and lingers in the air. I definitely like this parfum and would absolutely say try it for yourself. It's a pretty sensual scent and my finance likes it. This is a 2.9 ounce bottle at under 11.00 delivered to your door. I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. The discount I received will not alter my honest opinion in any way.

This is the focus of eau de parfum which makes it perfect to spray on hair or clothing. (Be careful with delicate fabrics such as silk, though, as they may stain.) The concentration of oils is over 15%, sometimes reaching as high as 20%. Since it is less intense than perfume extract, it is also cheaper, but it usually lasts well and is sold in small sizes.&#34; So it is stronger than Eau de Cologne which contains about 7% essence dissolved in alcohol of 60º or 70º, and stronger than Eau de toilette which contains around 10% aromatic essence. But not as strong as Perfume. This is the strongest of scents because of the higher concentration of essences – as much as 40% by volume.",

I actually purchased two Identical pair, except one was 6.5&#34; and one pair is 7.5&#34;. I wasn't sure which size would work for me, so I bought them both. I will give one pair to my daughter. I actually prefer the 7.5&#34; best for some reason, it just feels more balanced in my hand. Both pair cut equally well though.  I enjoy trimming my cut between visits and I'm pretty good at it.  It actually saves me a lot of money and allows me to visit the salon less often.  Also I sometimes trim my daughters hair and my boyfriends hair.  I have several  beauticians in the family (even though I am not) so I've learned the basics.  I got the scissors in quickly and packaged well.  The scissors fit my hand well, but I have smaller hands and fingers. I had no issues with that at all.  I also enjoyed that the scissors are crafted of fine stainless steel and are easy to manipulate. I purchased them for testing purposes. The pair I received open and close easily and with no issues.  The scissors were sharp and cut cleanly.  I am enjoying the scissors and believe they are a very good value. As I stated previously I am not a professional beautician, but for me, using the scissors at home they are perfect.  I have no complaints or issues and the product I've tried is working very well for me.",

    "text": "[[ASIN:B00VXEQ0WO Retinol 2.5% Cream From Majestic Pure for Face and Eye Area Will Nourish Your Skin, Potent Anti Aging Formula Reduces the Appearances of Wrinkles, Stretch Marks & Redness, 50ml]]<br /><br />I purchased Majestic Pure Retinol Cream because I am always looking for something that will help give my skin a more youthful appearance. After all, no one wants to look older or tired. I try all kinds of skin care products and really work hard at keeping my skin in good shape, so I decided I'd give this a try.I was speaking to a friend of mine recently whose skin always looks gorgeous. I asked her what she did to look so good? She is considerably older than me, but has no wrinkling and very pretty skin. She told me that she visits a dermatologist regularly and that she uses a retinol cream and that she pays 60.00 for just a small tube, plus the cost of the doctor visit. Now I am not sure of the strength of the retinoI cream she is using is, and I noticed this is 2.5% so I think that's a pretty effective dosage.The product came in a 1.7 fluid ounce moisturizer. I noticed that the retinol moisturizer also had Vitamin E & B5, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, Propolis and shea butter. So I thought about Vitamin A or retinol and what it does for the skin. Vitamin A stimulates and thickens the dermis where collagen, blood vessels and elastin are thereby reducing wrinkles and increasing blood flow to the surface of your skin. Vitamin A actually expands the deposit of collagen in the skin; therefore slowing down the normal aging breakdown of your collagen and elastin. I've also read when studying skin care (and I really researched it) that Vitamin A increases blood flow and reduces the symptoms of rosacea, helps heal wounds more quickly, repairs cells in the skin and optimizes UV protection, exfoliates to make the skin more smooth, supple and even and even decreases melanin granules reducing brown spots and pigmentation. Vitamin A decreases sebum (oil) thereby treating acne very well and even helps with the eradication of precancerous lesions of the skin and improves hydration. Skins miracle healer!My mother has always used vitamin E. She is in her 70's and still has beautiful skin and is very selective about what she puts on her skin. I've read that Vitamin E has been used in skincare for so long that it sometimes gets passed over for newer, more exotic-sounding ingredients that are sometimes advertised or added to products. But Vitamin E is a highly beneficial ingredient, a strong defense against free radicals and the damage the environment does to the skin. When it's combined with other antioxidants, It is an exceptional line of defense for your skin.The product is very good quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't leave your face shiny or greasy and seems to absorb within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too tight. There is no build up or product residue. This product has a  nice smell, light and soothing, and is quite easy to use. It's good that the items come in a pump, because exposure to air effects good quality ingredients. A little goes a long way, and the product seems to be lasting a good long time. I use many of Majestic Pure products, and I have had excellent luck with them all and no issues. This moisturizer already is reducing fine line and wrinkles in my skin. It really helps to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. I use this moisturizer on clean skin and I let it soak in, and use under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the cream soak in. This anti aging skin cream keeps your skin supple and moisturized. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried and it works well for me. I am not affiliated with any supplier or manufacturer of goods.",

    "text": "We are all searching for the fountain of youth! Okay I don't want to look old and wrinkled!  The description very much interested me so I decided I was ready to try it here!!  I've never tried anything from the dead sea and when I read that the product was made within a few miles of the Dead Sea, with no mineral degradation during transport.  I was anxious to give it a try. I try all sorts of things to keep that youthful glow of the skin but I also am selective about what I apply to my skin. Everything was natural here though, and It is not tested on animals, contains NO Alcohol, Sulfate or Parabens and is non- toxic.<br /><br />The product came in a 1.1 fluid ounce moisturizing serum. This product contains Glycerin and essential Dead Sea Minerals, known for their exceptional hydroscopic attributes and as a source of beautifying minerals. I read that in the description and thought what in the world is hydroscopic...so I looked it up.  &#34;Hygroscopy (etymology and pronunciation) is the ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through either absorption or adsorption with the absorbing or adsorbing substance becoming physically changed somewhat.&#34; They perform synergistically (which means together with) Squalane, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil and Wheat Protein to help increase the skin's moister levels and diminish water loss for a more vital and glowing overall look. After reading that in the description and researching what some of the terms meant, I decided to put the product to the test.  I have aging sking that is somewhat problematic with large pores and a few minor areas of sagging skin.  I read clearly in the description that Genesea Perfecting Serum helps to disapate the signs of skin aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagginess and that you would see effects of the serum in five minutes.<br /><br />I've been using the serum for a good while now sometimes under makeup and every night before going to bed at night on clean dry skin. The serum is of excellent quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't react against or burn the skin. I don't have a problem with it leaving my face greasy or shiny and it quickly absorbs into the skin within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming and suppleness of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too taut. There is no build up or product residue left on the skin at all. This product has a nice smell, light and kind of floral smelling,  but no bad smell at all.  It is quite easy to use with an pump dispenser for the serum. I always prefer a pump dispenser as it keeps the integrity of the product by keeping air and contaminants out.  A little of the serum goes a long way, and the product is lasting a good long time.<br /><br />This product really hydrates my skin and make it look nice and firm almost immediately. This serum  really works and is reducing wrinkles and fine lines I have starting in my skin. The skin on my face looks so much more supple.  It also seems to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. My skin also looks clearer with less break outs and skin problems. I use the serum on clean skin of the face and I let it soak in. I also add the serum all over my face, and under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness and last I add a good moisturizing cream. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the serums and cream soak in. The face serum contains ingredient that keep your skin smooth and moisturized.<br /><br />It seems to me that the manufacturers of the product have researched and thought out the effects of this product and have provided a great combination of products to promote beautiful skin. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried appear to be working very well for me.",

    "text": "Until a year ago, I never liked the idea of owning an electric toothbrush: I'd owned several cheap ones and never liked any of them. Then I figured that I'd try one again about a year ago and so I chose the Sonic Spinbrush by Arm & Hammer. I chose the Spinbrush because it had a large brush, which I thought meant less time/effort brushing my teeth.<br /><br />The Spinbrush worked pretty well, but the large brush head gagged me horribly. Because of this, I decided to give the Oral-B Vitality a try and I like it much better. The first reason I prefer the Vitality is because it has a much smaller brush head (you don't need a large brush with an electric toothbrush, since the toothbrush is doing all the work.) The smaller brush head also allows me to reach places the larger Spinbrush cannot reach, because it's too big. The Vitality is easier to maneuver in your hand as well, thanks to the smaller handle base.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like about the Spinbrush is how it would click off automatically after 2 minutes (I don't think all models of the Spinbrush do this, though.) The Vitality purposely sputters after 2 minutes for it's timing function, but then continues it's normal operation after a second or two. I still find this annoying, but at least I don't have to remove it from my mouth, dripping with toothpaste, just to turn it back on. And if I finish early, the Spinbrush required me to punch the button twice to stop it (again, something not easy to do with a vibrating toothbrush in your mouth), whereas the Vitality only requires a single button push. These two things alone make the Vitality much more convenient.<br /><br />I also think the Vitality is more powerful then the Spinbrush. The reason you had to push the button on the Spinbrush twice was so you could use it at a lower speed if necessary, but I never found that necessary at all. I prefer the more powerful Vitality, because it feels like it's cleaning better by not slowing down if I push too hard.<br /><br />About the only thing I liked better about the Spinbrush was that it had an indicator light on the base to tell you it was receiving power (I think it gauged the charge, too, but that was never a problem for me.) I'm not sure if that's even important, but it is something I tend to prefer with rechargeable items. Other than that, I love the Vitality and I much prefer it over the Spinbrush. Now I can brush my teeth without gagging and I am thankful for that.",

I apply the dye once every ~4-6 weeks, and leave it on for 2 hours since dye does not take to my hair very easily. For more accurate results and less skin dying, I use an old mascara brush that I've cleaned off with rubbing alcohol - no vaseline needed. My eyebrows are also tattooed which I cannot recommend highly enough.<br /><br />They say no eyelashes but I do mine very carefully with the mascara wand, again leaving on for about 2 hours. Between the dyed brows and lashes I don't usually wear makeup.<br /><br />When you mix the tint with the developer, put the developer in the mixing cup first! If you do it the other way around, the air blown out by the developer bottle will blow some of your dye out, and it'll dye your bathroom sink in an instant.<br /><br />Included a pic; forgive the grim face, it was taken just following the 2016 election.",

It does file the edge of jagged snags ok, but you do need patience.  I like having a file I don't have to replace frequently. It comes with a little red pleather case that is a little cheap looking; the file itself is a bit cheap-looking as well.  The sides are not totally rounded as advertised, but they are smooth.  The file surface is finely etched.  I do like that I can easily carry this around in my purse for on-the-go filing.",

    "text": "I received this product discounted in exchange for a review--I state this disclaimer upfront because that's what I would want to know first, and I too am disturbed by the ratings inflation on Amazon for IEF reviews lately. I do not indiscriminately give 5star reviews, and they are only given for a fraction of products I try that I find are exceptional and I would buy myself at FULL price.  If you wish not to view IEF reviews such as this, click on the filter link to the right of the review section, and then click on &#34;verified purchases only&#34;; that will take most of them out.<br /><br />Well, I'm overall pretty pleased with this product.  I got it hoping I could use it to organize some of my nail polish minis, and it does hold much of my collection.  The mini OPI bottles for the most part fit in the lipstick columns, though not all the way in, for some (strangely enough, the Nordic Collection ones are just a smidge smaller and go in smoothly, despite supposedly being the same exact size).  That was the main purpose of me getting this, so I'm pleased.  I know it was made for other types of makeup, but I already have a system for them; it was all my loose polishes that were driving me nuts.  Please note that you won't get many full-size polishes to fit, though the Essie square type bottles make it easier to get as many in as possible.  As you can see, I had to put some big bottles upside-down to fit more in.  It still had room for my nail brushes, file, foils, tapes, glitters, and cotton balls in the bottom.  The material is a very clear acrylic, but it doesn't feel too cheap.  One complaint I have is the drawers can get a little stuck; but this is common with these acrylic drawers.  Also, the top pc is separate from the bottom drawers, which I don't like.  But these are all minor complaints.  Overall, pleased it does the job.",

I probably could have found a way to re-secure them at the cuticle if I'd wanted to take the time, and they would have lasted longer.<br /><br />This design is really gorgeous, too.

I find myself pulling my hair into a quick bun, rather than deal with it. This new hair straightening brush is amazing. In 3 minutes I am able to brush the frizz out for a smoother, more polished look. It is fun and easy to use. This brush heats up fast, and does the job. I used to dread washing my hair, because then it was really out of control. This time though, with the brush, it was only 15 minutes to completely straighten my curly frizzy still damp hair. It is the 2nd day - after shampooing and straightening -and it still looks sleek, I didn't even brush it. This product may not be a life saver, but it is a time saver - and it feels good to look good.",

I've started recently using glycerine as well for making echinatia extracts for my kids when they are sick.

So far, I've used these for hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, spray stain remover (hydrogen peroxide and dawn), and a floor cleaner (basically alcohol, soap and water). And they sprayer has been great. They are also pretty and not an eyesore if you have them sitting on your countertop. Since having a baby last year, I've become much more aware and careful about what I use to clean with. Through my research, I found that hydrogen peroxide is just as effective as bleach and SO much safer. The problem for me was that of it is exposed to light (a clear spray bottle) it loses its effectiveness. Many people just attach a sprayer to a hydrogen peroxide bottle but I wanted something that looked a bit nicer. The only thing I wasn't happy about is that, like other reviews have mentioned, it was packaged very poorly. It came in a cardboard box with one piece of a cardboard insert to separate the bottles, and even then it only separated two of the bottles, not all four. Luckily, the bottles weren't damaged, but I find it strange that I've purchased mascara that has come with more padding than these had ;) anyway, it shouldn't deter you from ordering, because these are great bottles at a great price and if they do get broken in transit, Amazon is excellent at replacing and returning items.",

I am on 2 different types of chemo drugs and it has played havoc on my long hair. Kim Kardashian knows her stuff for sure! I have tried at least 30 different products to help with the frizz in my hair. I received a small sample bottle of this in a monthly subscription box I get. A small bottle of this lasted me about 4 months of daily use. I used it right after a wash while my hair was still wet and then right after blow drying and using the straightening iron and then a tiny bit to give my hair that shiny finished, sleek look. Let me tell you, my hair looks and feels like silk after using this. First off, the tangles fall right out. The heat from my iron doesn't damage my hair any longer and my husband says my hair feels like spun silk! This is also a dry oil so there is no oily build up or feel at all. Also, look at the AMAZING price that this is offered at! Wow! I will be heartbroken if they ever stop selling this stuff!<br />Now, there is only one con to this dry black seed oil. It has a small aroma that to me smells like pencil shavings. Almost like when you were in elementary school standing at the pencil sharpener getting your pencils all sharpened up for your tests!  The good news is that the smell doesn't stay in your hair but for a few minutes.  Other than that, you can't go wrong with this product!",

I'm not properly set up over here either...... I just reallllllllyyyy think they need to do something about the bottom attachment piece to make this thing completely sturdy, because those lights get HOT!!!..........<br /><br />Also when it showed up one of the lights was broken..... I never said anything to anyone about it though because it was for the night in the middle, and I don't really need that one........ But I probably should have just to get it replaced.<br /><br />The last negative thing is that it makes a pretty loud humming noise while it's on. And depending on the brightness, it gets louder. (oddly it gets louder as the lights go dimmer....)<br /><br />But on a bright note........ I can barely ever actually get my mom to get undressed to actually let the light shine on her skin....... (She doesn't know who I am most of the time, so I can't blame her....... ) but one time I was able to get her to....... we laid under it for probably 45 minutes........ and she was in such a bright and cheery mood after we got up.......... it was awesome.<br /><br />So. Red light therapy really works.......... as far as this product goes.......... the fact that it's not totally sturdy, I think is dangerous, especially if you're in my situation with an older parent......... but it was the best one I could find. I don't regret buying it, but I hope that they replace the plastic piece at the bottom with metal.",

    "text": "I've been going tying to make some more environmentally friendly swaps lately and these bamboo brushes are one of the ways. I do really like these. The bristles don't shed like some do the other brands that I have tried. They hold up well and then when done, the bristles can be removed and the handle composted, leaving behind little in the end compared to the mountain of plastic handles in a lifetime.<br /><br />But we have five people on my house. I'd love a way to identify whose brush is whose. I've seen some companies put numbers, others do colored bristles (which obviously won't work so well with charcoal), and maybe there are other options as well. Once that happens, these will be perfect.",

But here's the problem: the random amount of product that you get.<br /><br />I've barely made a dent in the Emulsion and Skin products (so those will last another couple months at least) but I'll run out of the Cream this week. So there's about two month's worth of product I'm missing from the Cream. So I either have to try to re-buy that one product separately or introduce a completely different brand into my skincare regimen. I don't know what the manufacturers were thinking when they created the amounts of these products. Totally random.",

I tried this on it's own to check consistency & skin feel & man is it dry. It's hard to describe oil as dry, but when you feel it you know what I mean. It's not emollient. I tried making some skin oil & hair oil products with it & you can't use much of this without that dry factor creeping in. Probably better suited for hair. I'm going to keep experimenting but right now I have a huge hunk of mango butter & can only use it sparingly before it messes with the emollient function of the other oils so I'm probably going to still have this block in 2035.",

The bottom portion is deep, but if you fill it with powder, it over covers the puff too much and ends up getting everywhere, and there's no way to shake it off because the puff fits tightly into the deep portion and there's no way to shake off the excess powder. There's a middle piece with a center knob thing, which is hard to get out because it fits tightly metal to metal, and I have to use my nail to separate it from the bottom portion little by little, or powder goes everywhere, and even doing it slowly, powder spills. I've tried putting powder in the center piece, but the knob thing gets in the way, so I have to use the sides of the puff to get powder from the edges, but THATS better than pouring powder in the bottom portion though, because the puff is stored in that area also, and will get covered in powder, which is overkill. The puff literally has to rest on all the powder if you fill it (Don't!). It's just not made for easy use, and powder ends up in places I don't want it, like on any surface you place the container and center knob thing tray. The cost is okay, if it was functional. It just doesn't make much sense, other than looking cute if you choose a color you like. I just wanted to dip a puff in a little powder for a light dusting after a shower, and this contraption is just more trouble than it's worth.

The one downside (wasnt that big of a deal to me) is that it dose collapse while using it but it still works! I have only used it once so far so i will write additional reviews if something changes. Oh and it dosent come off of the dryer easily which is good (there are silicon prongs on the inside so it fits the hairdyer). I read alot of reviews before purchasing this one (it was between 3 different diffusers). Hope this helps anyone that is considering buying one.",

The balm really does the job with no downside.  This oil does a better job re:  getting the beard ready to be combed into a presentable shape, but comes with the down side of being oily.

Had a hard time getting them to apply in a decent fashion. This one definitely lost over the other pallet. The plus side is, it does come with some sticker stencils, and a pack of wipes and paint brushes. For it being so cheap, that does help make up a little bit for the quality.

It's truly black, creamy if slightly drying (it dries matte), doesn't run even without lipliner for me, has nice coverage, and lasts a while. It does start to rub off with eating and drinking, in my experience, but it's not extremely noticeable. Like most lipsticks, the color just fades as your natural lip color shows through, which in this case means it gradually gets grayer. But it definitely lasts longer than most dark lipsticks I've worn, and I don't mind occasionally reapplying.",

I had ordered a more expensive front lace wig, and the hairline of that wig was horrible. It was a nightmare to create the hairline needed to complete another costume. The Ebingoo wig is nothing like that one. Ebingoo came with a perfect hairline. I just cut along the edge of the lace to remove the excess. It had a similar hairline that I have but more hair at the receding parts. I am very happy and will be ordering more of this wig brand/series in the future.<br /><br />To complete my wigs' look I just used a curling hair drier brush to curl the ends to appear more like Loki from the movies.",

This worked very well at removing the callus by shaving it down then using the other end to smooth it out. The way the blade is mounted makes it safer so you don't accidentally cut yourself but you should still be cautious becuase I can see how it would be possible to cut yourself if your not careful. The handle and angle of the blade helps reach the bottom of your foot easier and it has a protective cover that slides back and forth and snaps into place so you can switch back and forth from using the blade or the &#34;cheese grater&#34;. The only reason I did not give it a five star review is becuase I wish it came with a few extra blades, so you will want to purchase those as well becuase they get dull pretty fast. The other reason is that the other end that I refer to as the &#34;cheese grater&#34; is a thin piece of metal that is curved and snaps/slides into place on the handle and has fallen out a couple times during use. It easily snaps/slides back on and still works well to smooth out the callus.",

I tried the light version and was pleasantly surprised that it worked just as well as the regular, without the red armpits!

I wasn't around to when they were selecting reviewers for their conditioner but now that it's available for purchase I'm glade to say I've bought it for full sale price being 20 USD.  Like it's shampoo counterpart the bottle is 28oz total.<br /><br />Texture: White and creamy<br />Scent: Pleasant and definitely not reeking of tea tree oil like it's shampoo sister<br />Slip: Slip is a product's ability to allow one to detangle hair effectively and not need to use too much product to do so. For the amount I used which is pretty standard across the board with all conditioners I've tried, this conditioner is rated at 5/5 for slip<br />Moisture: Next to none but that isn't a real issue due to most of the oils being found in Keeva's tea tree oil shampoo<br />Standout Ingredients: hydrolyzed keratin ( protein ), argania spinose ( Moroccan argon oil ), cetearyl alchol ( fatty alcohol )<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cocos nucifera ( Coconut Oil ) isn't listed as an ingredient, however it is featured as an ingredient on the front of the bottle.<br />Melaleuca alternifolia ( Tea Tree Oil ) isn't listed as an ingredient either.<br />Both of these oils is on the front of the bottle being featured however, the product doesn't list the oils as ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, I believe this to be a quality conditioner even better than some brands found in salons. Price of the bottle is reasonable for the quantity received. This conditioner does provide one with good slip and it doesn't leave hair feeling heavy or weighted down after rinsing. I feel that when used with it's sister shampoo, you'll benefit from this conditioner most .",

As a person whose been using shea butter for well over 10 years for ecezma treatment I can say that this shea butter is a quality product. Although it is a quality shea butter, the way it has been processed left the butter very grainy and not as creamy as I was expecting. It is a thick, heavy butter that is solid at room temperature and has a lot of use for hair and body purposes. It is sourced from an area in Africa that doesn't produce a real rancid smelling butter. It smells distinctly like shea but not like the shea sourced from more eastern countries. The butter when applied to the skin feels thick and heavey but that isn't a problem for me. I would need to indirectly melt and re-solidify this butter in order to smooth it out and kill the grainy texture it comes with. I'd also whip this butter to make it creamy.<br /><br />Price: Reasonable<br />Texture: Grainy but not too smooth, sort of like peanut butter but thicker<br />Color: Ivory, more of an off white, cream like tone<br />Scent: Hard to describe but it's distinctly Shea which never smells pleasing<br /><br />Overall, this company's shea butter is a good quality butter, high quality for some but for me good/decent due to the fact it's grainy and doesn't have the smooth texture I'm used too. The color is normal and the butter feels thick, heavy and heavenly on thick dry skin like eczema. I'd recommend this company's shea butter and possibly repurchase in the future.<br /><br />•This quality shea butter was purchased for a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.",

    "text": "This iron is mediocre in performance and quality. The iron is very heavy to hold and has a semi long heat up time.  This isn't an iron I'd honestly recommend and the price the company charges full price is outrageous for the quality of this iron.<br /><br />My hair texture is 3C/4A and it is relaxer free.  It requires high heats to lay flat.  All of my irons is set to 450 degrees when in use.  Before any flat ironing can begin I start with clean freshly shampooed and conditioned hair. I  then blow dry, prestreching it so that it is easier to iron out.  I use a blow out cream which also protects my hair from heat damage and a vented brush when blow drying. After I'll apply a argon oil serum and a frizz busting serum to my hair.  These oils aide in getting my hair to lay flat with out any frizz.<br /><br />Iron snagged my hair upon first use. I thought that maybe it was user error but it wasn't as the second time I ran the iron across a different section of hair  it was snagged. I also had issues with my iron staying on.  The placement of the on and off switch makes it very easy to turn this iron on and off while in use. The iron didn't even stay plugged in when I was using it.  I was constantly giggling the cord to get it to turn back in.  This iron doesn't glide down a section of hair well.  It is very choppy thus leading to the snagged hair I spoke of earlier.  The iron does swivel while in use making it easy to use.  It goes up to 450 degrees but it's very difficult to maintain any temperature selected on this iron.<br /><br />I don't recommend this iron simply due to the fact it snags at hair. It does work to smooth down hair but it doesn't work well as it cannot  guide down smoothly. The only good thing about this iron is the fact it is very attractive to look at.  I'm happy to say that I didn't pay full price as I received this for a promotional price.  Had I paid full price I would have promptly returned  this iron.<br /><br />*** In exchange for my unbiased and honest review I received this iron for a promotional price.",

I got not one but 3 different dates for this item to be delivered I even reached out to see what was going on and they did apologize about the delay and it was on it's way. The date they told me it never showed up😠 so I cancelled they ordered and got my refund back and just got something else for my son's hair. please tell me why yesterday 1/18/23 this product was at my door!? once I opened the package the liquid was all over the inside of the bag  it was sent in ☹️the lid was off and broken on the bottle definitely wasn't packaged correctly this is the first time I've ever experienced this problem.",

I don't like these nearly as well as the Eye Scrubs I bought previously on Amazon.  They seemed the clean the eyes better.<br /><br />I've used these wipes now for a few times and I find I have to wipe a lot to get the eyes really clean.  I also wish they came in a refillable container but they do have a little flap to close the package.  The price is very good for two packages at $14.95 with Prime.<br /><br />So if a person is just looking for an eye makeup remover, this is a very good product.  It's gentle, low priced and does it's job.  I just like the ones I mentioned better even though they are so much more expensive.",

I have a natural wave to my hair and will use a flat iron to straighten my thick hair. It usually takes me about 15 minutes to get my hair done but with this new flat iron hair brush it only took me 9 minutes. Being a mother of three children, every minutes counts so I was delighted to cut an average of 6 minutes off of doing my hair. I should add that my hair was soft and shiny after straightening likely due to the built in Ionic generator. I also love that it has 5 heat settings allowing me to pick the one that works best for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Heats up very fast.<br />- Easy to use.<br />- Power cord is 78&#34; long and rotates.<br />- Built in Ionic generator.<br />- 5 heat settings with LED display.<br />- Automatically turns off after 45 minutes making it safer to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's heavier than most flat irons.<br /><br />Overall, I really do love this flat iron hair brush. It works well and makes the hair straightening process much quicker.<br /><br />I received a discount in order to test the product. However, I post reviews so consumers can make informed decisions. Thus, any discounts received have no impact on my reviews.  If you have any questions, please leave a comment and I will be happy to help answer them if I can.

    "text": "I have been using this cream on my stomach and behind/between my thighs, twice a day, for over a week now. I can happily say that I am seeing results! I have been doing patches on my back thighs to help with cellulite but I am only using the cream on my stomach and inner thighs. I am so excited to see how much more dramatic the results will be. I noticed another reviewer was brave enough to post pics of her results and they were amazing. Just be vigilant and apply it twice a day, every day and you should see results.<br /><br />Directions for use are to apply a suitable amount of cream to the target area while gently massaging in a circular, upward motion. You can apply it twice a day, morning and evening.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the results!<br /><br />I received a discount in order to test the product. However, I post reviews so consumers can make informed decisions. Thus, any discounts received have no impact on my reviews. If you have any questions, please leave a comment and I will be happy to help answer them if I can. I hope you found my review to be helpful. Happy Shopping!",

At first it will feel greasy but if you keep rubbing it in, it won't. It'll feel like nothing is there. It also combines well with essential oils, make up, and moisturizers.",

    "text": "I waited to write a review on this product because, at first, I was not sure about it.  The product is well packaged and easy to use.  I am 54 years old and after the first night I used it, I woke up the next morning and my face was red and a bit swollen.  At first I thought maybe I was having an allergic reaction.  I noticed after one use my skin was much smoother, as if the top layer of dead skin came off.  I gave my face a few days of a break, as this product seems to be a strong one, and reluctantly tried it again.  I did not have the same reaction with the redness and swelling.  So I kept using this product, but as it is a strong one, I use it only 2-3 times a week.  After about a couple of weeks using it, I discovered all kinds of undesirable things coming out of the pores of my skin, I developed little pussy sores and pimples, but the pimples were not like the regular pimple, these were deep and what came out was really think and sometimes hard.  Instead of having what I thought was an allergic reaction, I think this product was pulling impurities out of my skin and detoxing it.  I also had a couple of small, sebaceous cysts on my forehead and after about a month of using this product, they were gone!  I was told by a plastic surgeon the only way to get rid of them was surgery but I didn't want the scar on my forehead so never had anything done about them, I had them for years.  To this day, the cysts are gone.  My skin no longer reacts as if impurities are being pulled out.  There is still a small amount of burning on the nights I use this product but if I follow it up with argon oil or rose hip oil, the burning goes away.  I've noticed my skin is a firmer, smoother in texture, very soft, and the skin tone is more even.  Although I got amazing results, this product may be overpriced considering it is only ascorbic acid.  Maybe the products in the activator justifies the price but as I'm not an expert on ingredients, I'm not sure.",

The angled brush wasnt on my spoolie by the way. It seems the glue came apart and it fell off. Does it work? Yes. It does what the applicators are intended for. Is it worth what I paid for? YES. It is worth what I paid for ($1.00) will I buy this at retail price?! Probably not. With another promotional code? Definitely! I absolutely love the package it came in though. It's very girlie.

There were no instructions on how much to add in the bath. So I searched the internet and it's basically based on how strong you like the scent. I used far less than what I would for Epsom salt. Maybe a few tablespoons. It was plenty strong. I've had better smelling lavender bath products than this one. Furthermore, after taking a bath, my muscles didn't feel any better. I feel an improvement when I use Epsom salt.<br /><br />Won't be using this product again between the disappointing scent and inability to soothe tired muscles.",

Well, this is a simple, basic note that to me smells metallic and musky, in a VERY good way!  My nose picks it up very well and it is gorgeous - I will layer my weaker YSL fragrances with it but I will also wear it alone because I like it that much!  To me it is definitely a masculine scent, and I agree w/ others - it probably depends on your skin chemistry with this, which to me is a unique bonus - because that makes it a different scent on every person.  Since this takes 3 weeks to arrive and the bottle is not that big, I will be buying another very soon!  Highly recommend :)",

These extension made by Jaunhair are just gorgeous and they are all human hair as I can tell from the styling I do.  The hair is in superb condition, shiny and healthy looking and teh strands feel exceptionally strong. The coloring is beautiful and natural even. I have bought so many tape in extensions for twice and more the price many times that come nowhere near being this beautiful.  I was so please i turned around and ordered more immediately.  I have actually been considering adding some blue and other colors to my hair and I will be buying these extensions to do so so was happy to see some of the colors I wanted were available.  If you are considering some tape in extensions these are the ones to get, you will look like you wearing $150 dollar extensions but you will only be paying a quarter of the price.",

I opened the box only to find the lashes had actual small magnets on them. They both stuck to the packaging and took forever to peel off. Two magnets weren't even attached to one of the lashes, but we're attached to the box. I did try them out but ended up not using them. On my trial run, the one that was missing a couple magnets wouldn't stay on well, and the other one just felt bulky. The one with all the magnets did stay on! So if you're used to wearing them it may be something to try.<br /><br />Now, I will admit I'm not a typical lash wearer. I can feel when I'm wearing mascara and eyeliner. I just don't wear much makeup aside from bronzer and eyeliner. I'm also no stranger to getting dolled up and going a full night at a party in lashes either. These were just very disappointing.",

When the razor started slowing down, I charged them (red light never came on telling me to charge them) but the charge worked fine<br />-I've been using the razor daily for weeks and I would most definitely purchase another one at this price<br />What surprised me:<br />-The razor is small and the shaving area is smaller than my other razors but it cuts great while hardly making any sound at all<br /><br />OVERALL: Great razor for the price.

I was panicked for a moment there but once I swished the blackness out of my mouth, all was good.  I noticed whiter teeth within 2 days!  I went a step further and added pelu powder and my teeth got even whiter!  Can't say enough good things about my Mud.  Will definitely buy more when this jar is gone!",

All of the other colors are sold by an off-brand and looks like it leaves serious gaps. I think you'll be disappointed if you order the cheaper masks. I'm not sure when these fake masks were added, but look up the pictures from this brand on other items.<br /><br />Original Review: Easier option. I wore this mask to protect against the dust storms of BRC and it fit the bill. There are several different types from Vogmask, but mind was a microfiber mask that was very soft and vibrant on the outside, but it had a backing on the inside that did some serious filtering and fit on my face just great. Breathing was never and issue and it was FAR easier than the other method that I brought (over the head construction filter masks) because you can snap them onto your ears and over the mouth in seconds without messing up a costume/wig. My bf has the all-cotton one and loves it, although it has faded from the sun and washings. The best part is I will use this again for several years. Worth every penny!",
