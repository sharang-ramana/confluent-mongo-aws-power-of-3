I've been using a flat iron to smooth it out and get rid of the kinky nature.  This has worked great for me instead.  I wash it, dry it, and then just brush.  One word of caution, the nubs are very hot, so you can put your hand over them, also, your hair will be warm for a few seconds after you brush thru it.  I discovered I could use a dry wash cloth or heat resistant glove to assist in keeping  my hair against the warming surface.  As I place the brush under my hair & brush downward, I place my other hand (protected by cloth or glove) over the nubs, thereby holding the hair tight against the surface.  The smoothing effect is great without any burning of the hair like with a straight iron.  We also used it on my mixed race granddaughter whose hair is much thicker and kinkier.  It took a little longer than it did on me, but it did smooth her hair faster than with a hot iron.",

So, I tried to tighten the lids a bit more while trying not to overdo it on the plastic tops and over-tighten. I was never able to screw the tops on and keep them from leaking.

You have to have a very small head to get this on without half of your own hair exposed.  Even with a wig cap, the bands of the wig are visible.<br /><br />Second, it's THIN.  The cap, albeit airy, is visible throughout the wig, especially at the top of the bangs.<br /><br />Third, it's quite shiny.  Even for a gray-based color, but dry shampoo does help a little.<br /><br />Fourth, the texture is stick-straight.  The picture looks a little wavy, but it's not.<br /><br />Fifth, the hair texture is a bit odd.  It's actually slippery, so glossy that a barette or band slides right out of it without any effort.  The photo looks a lot more natural.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's a fail,  It might work for someone else, but sadly, not me.",

I normally buy from Lumes website but they are insanely slow to ship and they're headquartered in my city. I needed this yesterday so I had to buy on Amazon. My 14yo son is stinky. I believe this to be true for most teenage boys. However this stuff solved that problem. Because it works for extra hours, it helps the forgetful kids. I haven't gagged at the smell of my son since we found this stuff. Buy this, lots of it, if you have stinky boys.<br />Second, let's talk big boobs: I've got 'em. It's super hard to keep the under boob area dry & chafing free in 100° summers. This does not stop sweat - but it does stop the smell & most importantly the red chafing that goes along with it. I have very sensitive skin & have tried 'all the things' to cure my constant red, chafing & sometimes yeast infected under boobs - including Dr prescribed ointments. This did it when nothing else does.<br />I will admit this stuff is ridiculously expensive. It doesn't smell pretty. The shipping is slow direct from them. They've messed up 2 of my orders (not Amazon) But for the 2 reasons I stated above (teenagers & underboobs), I will continue to purchase this in all forms & scents.",

Both sets had 4 of the exact same colors, and changed only two: one had white and pale yellow the other set navy blue and brown.

Your results may vary, but it wouldn't hurt to try these masks if you've developed broken capillaries.  Certainly there is &#34;plumping&#34;, and my skin is bouncy and supple the next morning.

I did rub it into my hands and it dries fast without leaving an oily slick.<br /><br />What I did use this for is my hair, which is very thick and very dry.  After shampooing, I poured a little bit of the oil into my hand and rubbed my hands together.  Then I ran my hands through my hair, keeping the oil away from the scalp area.  Afterwards, I blew my hair dry then applied more oil.  Usually, I apply a gel in the same manner that calms the frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.  However, the oil did not produce the same results.  My hair still had flyaway ends with no gloss to it.  My newly washed and dried hair always looks better the next morning after the hair product has had a chance to calm the frizzy hair shafts, but the morning after I used the oil, the results were no different than the night before.<br /><br />I'll stick to my gel product to end the frizziness of dry hair.",

I woke up with terrible hair to the point that I had to wash so I can style it.  No way I could leave the house looking like that.  The curls were loose and uneven, wack waves and broken off ends.  Just terrible.  Here are the things that didn't go as expected:<br />1)  It's not so easy to put them on and takes 5 tries before one is on<br />2) The velcro pulls hair and makes it messy and fizzy<br />3) Very hard to keep the ends secure, so I. had chunks of broken tips on the floor and sink as I took them off<br />4) The waves are not round as you sleep on it and some look bent depending on how you slept, so more of a kink than a curl<br />5) No way 8 rollers can cover the whole head, so you need at least 2 boxes to do it properly<br />6) the front of the hair looked awful, as it turned into my forehead with a kink<br /><br />All and all, it was a waste and I'm returning them.  Watching all the hair that was left in the rollers with the velcro and on the floor from breaking off, I find it damaging.",

The convenience of being able to shave on-the-go and the closeness this Norelco provides are both well worth the investment. Although, I've got to mention that I got a little lucky price-wise because the Norelco 7885XL magically appeared as one of my Amazon \"Gold Box\" promotion items so I jumped at the chance to buy this model at an incredible savings! Other than an excellent shave, my favorite features are the \"time remaining\" and the \"needs cleaning\" indicators on the LCD screen. The unit quickly charges to the full 45 minutes of run time in about an hour and is easy to clean by simply flipping open the head assembly and rinsing under the faucet. Did I mention quiet? Yep, the 7885XL is whisper quiet. Did I mention close? I'm getting a closer shave than I've ever gotten from a hand razor. Price, convenience, money-back guarantee from Norelco (use it for 21 days and get a full refund if you're not happy) - Buy it! Chances are, you'll be pleased you did.",

I even got brave the next day and did my entire body, yes even my face! It works with your body so you should sleep in it , the next day is when you really see the results! The pictures are immediately after one application! Use the mitt that comes with it, take your time and spread! You will have a nice tan!",

However some of my hair overtime due to poor hairbrushes became too matted and will just have to be cut out. For me bore brushes have always been too soft. They control frizz, and make my hair shine on the surface but lack any kind of pull so that overtime my hair will get out of control. With most plastic and nylon brushes I am either breaking to much of my hair or causing myself pain while obtaining mixed results.  With that said,  this brush does a very nice job at keeping my hair under control and giving it that beautiful luster. It has just the right amount of rigidity to pull at those tangles, but it also knows when to give so as to keep these locks in gorgeous harmony. So if you like me are seeking a good quality hairbrush, possibly look at this one.  I can't guarantee you will have good results like mine because everyone has different hair, but for the price it's worth a try.",

It is perfect for sitting on top of my vanity and it holds all of the items I am currently using or testing out.  I have purchased several organizers from U.S. Acrylic and have never been disappointed.  They are sturdy and there are so many varieties that you are bound to find exactly what you are looking for.  As a bonus, the clear acrylic looks nice sitting on top of my vanity.  I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to organize and/or display makeup, skincare, or any other beauty items.",

Scent lasts on your body but isn't overpowering & won't mess with perfumes. It's really a lovely smell. I paid about $8 a few months ago & that was a great price. I will buy again if it doesn't double in price like many other items do!! It's thick, a little goes a long way. So it will last you longer than many larger size body washes that are thin & cheaply made.<br />Love it!!!",

The seller emailed me back saying they had seen something about a discontinuation and possibly a warning, and gave me the phone number for BORBA. I called the number, and it is no longer in service. I checked, and it is the number on the BORBA website. Then, I went through their website email screen, filled out the information, and still haven't heard from them in almost two weeks.<br /><br />I kinda liked the feel of this cream, but no longer trust BORBA, due to the above. I do not recommend purchasing this product, because (1) it is discontinued under suspicious circumstances and (2) manufacturer is unavailable to contact by phone or email.",

If you need a gentler wash just lighten you pressure and if you need a good scrub just at more pressure.  I throw the pad in the wash with my towels each week so, it is easily kept clean.  Also, it has a hook so, I hang it up to dry after each use.  Great product that is just so simple and easy to use.<br />Sample provided for review",

They are still the same size but the shape has improved. I am a former bf mom so they are not as perky as they once were. I wouldn't say this is a replacement for surgery or anything though. For me just seeing any improvement is exciting, so I am satisfied with this cream. I wasn't really expecting this to work in the beginning, I began to see a difference around the third day. I used it twice a day.<br /><br />The smell is a little different. It was musky to me. It doesn't smell bad.. but it could be better. The size is probably enough for a few months, I still have tons so a little goes a long way. The consistency is thick and really blendable. A little nickel sized amount is about what I use each time because it spreads easily. It really just feels like lotion on your skin, it isn't sticky or gel like.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this was the fragrance, the scent is not a scent I would normally wear but since it does seem to benefit my breasts it<br />Is a scent I can live with, I just spray perfume over my shirt and it covers it up.<br /><br />Overall I am happy about this cream, even with the change being suttle so far it still has some affect and that's better than nothing for me. I'm hoping I see more improvement with this in the long run and I will continue using it.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I have to admit that I thought my sample jars were a bit better than the full size in regards to performance but that being said, I really like these.<br /><br />Lavendar and Cleary sage both have calming effects.  If you are a guy and would like some zen but don't want estrogen effects that lavender can cause  opt for the clary sage.<br /><br />For performance, hmmmm.....when I used my samples i had zero issues with odor, even after workouts. I did not go through any detox issues but i haven't used conventional deodorants in years.<br /><br />Now that I'm on my full size, i find it isn't quite as good as before. Then again, I'm perimenopausal so with raging hormones, who knows what is going on with my body!<br /><br />It will not keep you from sweating during hot environments or workouts, but that's actually a good thing. Your body is designed to sweat out the bad stuff and to cool you down. It does help with odor control for sure and yes, detox is a real thing. Drink more water to help. If you are having any serious issues with detox, use the tea tree oil one. Tea tree is a great antibacterial and antifungal.<br /><br />I'm overall very happy with these products. I do highly recommend them and I know I will be continuing to use them.",

There were no duplicates (which I was concerned about) and while there are three dark blues that are somewhat similar, there are enough differences in the bottles to make them unique.  I had two of the colors already but considering I have about 15 of this brand already getting only 2 that I already owned was amazing!  All in all, this purchase was definitely worth it!  Where I live, these bottles run about $8/each so I just got $160 worth of polish for just $35.  Hard to top that!<br /><br />For those wondering, the colors in my lot are as follows:<br />330 -  Pedal to the Metal<br />843 -  Pink Shell<br />851 - Sheer Force<br />849 - Highgray to Heaven<br />846 - King of Shadows<br />495 - Fe Fi Fo Plum<br />840 - Marooned<br />842 - Indigo Wave<br />834 - Searsucker<br />650 - Navy Baby<br />577 - Dark Huemoor<br />844 - Dark Denim<br />660 - Pat on the Black<br />545 - On Pines and Needles<br />852 - Grass is Greener<br />430 - Grass Slipper<br />854 - Desert Poppy<br />400 - Get Juiced<br />250 - Mudslide<br />850 - Tupeio Honey",

Or a well-meaning aunt gives you a spa package with an eye mask that was silky but looked like you had a panty liner on your face. NOW, these are available, in fun colors. The best feature is that they are concave, formed, so that you can bat your eyelashes inside and your REMs will not be suppressed. You can open and close your eyes ad libitum, thus giving you more freedom and less of a claustrophobic feel. These are light, easy to pack, or store, comfortable, SO, comfortable, and they block 99% of the light.

It took a few days to arrive but came packaged well.  I immediately took it out of the box and tried it.  I layered it daily as directed initially.  IT HAS NEVER CHIPPED! I've had it on for almost a month. It is shiny as well.  I now have a full set of lovely long strong nails......I only used the clear.  I still work so I'm typing all day long.  I do my own cleaning so my hands are in use in soapy water, etc regularly.  My nails aren't pampered.  I have always had brittle weak nails with ridges, etc.  Had acrylic for years [over 20] and covid put a stop to that.  I'm so glad I found this product.  I just today did one nail in the neutral color that came with the set I purchased.  I'll see how long that one goes without chipping.  You just have to try this!

    "text": "The best thing about this serum is that it's completely non greasy. It feels like putting thickened water on your face, but instead of evaporating, it stays on your face and continues to moisturize. I have been using it as a lightweight moisturizer after i wash my face with either an AHA or BHA facewash, so that it really sinks in. That said, it is not enough to use it as a standalone moisturizer, probably exactly because it's non greasy and doesn't create a barrier on your face to keep the moisture in. It says on the bottle to follow up with a moisturizer, and I will but I wanted to test it out alone first.<br />I really like the dropper packaging - you can be very exact about how much serum you're using. I have tried it with different amounts. Today I used only 1/3 of a dropper, and I still feel like it was too much product so next time I will try it will 1/4 dropper. It comes shipped with a screw on cap that you can save and use for travel.<br />I have to say that this really does work. My face feels plump and moisturized with no tight feeling on the surface. It's light enough to put even under my eyes and I don't fear that it will cause millia or clogged pores. I don't have a lot of fine lines yet (36), but my skin is prone to flaking and this takes care of that, all day.<br />It has a very light smell - kind of herbal, but light and inoffensive.<br />I should mention that I received this in exchange for a fair and honest review, and that I have tested and reviewed to the best of my ability.",

The \"musk\" referred to as \"amber musk\" is the most subtle and acceptable of these; it is somewhat \"softer\" than the old, familiar drugstore variety that had its heyday in the '80s. The florals smell cheap; very few fragrances use essence of living flowers and that is necessary to distill a true floral scent. The jasmine has a \"brassy\" top note as does the honeysuckle. No one should do \"vanilla\" anymore; it is a cloying and overwhelming smell (not scent), rather than a complex \"caramel\", and this one is no different. (Acqua di Parma is the only line that includes \"vanilla\" notes in its scents that have class and understatement.)

Well stop looking, because here they are!!! #TakeNotes<br />Likes...<br />1. This set has six colors and they all have many different shapes and sizes to choose from!<br />2. The flatback makes them easy to glue and hold in place.<br />3. You can choose from small round shapes to larger star, heart or diamond shapes. AND...<br />4. To make it easy to grab and place your rhinestones, a flat L-shaped tweezer with a pointy end is included.<br />Room for improvement:<br />You need to buy glue, it's not included. #DontForget<br />The cute shapes are not the same for each color...I got only one black star, one green heart, and one beautiful iridescent oblong diamond. Also, the cute shapes are all larger sizes and take up lots of space on my short nails.<br />Lastly, the white pencil is not waxy, and didn't pick up the rhinestones, but I didn't need it.<br />OKAY, STOP SCROLLING... THIS IS IT! You cannot go wrong with this set. It should be in your collection, I am happy it's in mine. Raise your hand if you #PutEmInTheCart !!!!<br />#LetsHeadToCheckout  #ClassIsDismissed",

So I'm browsing Amazon looking at what others had to say and after a long process I end up on Darksyde. After reading and comparing the reviews to other more expensive brands I decided I would give this one a shot since the price was decent compared to the others. The thing I like best is, it goes on dark. You can see everywhere you put it while your putting on, this alone should eliminate streaks. It does lighten up soon after and just as the instructions said became a even shade everywhere it wads placed. The same day it was  visible by at least 3 shades where I put lotion and didn't . So  break the bank if your looking for a nice even non orange tan. You will be happy. I would like to side comment that I used the Thermalabs self tanning mitt whenever appling",

I have a cortizone cream I put on once or twice a day and then put a glove on to keep the cream from getting rubbed off or getting near my eyes. I also put a moisturizer on at night before going to bed and then wear a pair of gloves to keep the moisturizer from wearing off. So far they've worked great.<br /><br />The quality of these gloves actually surprised me. They are well made and the material is substantial. These aren't flimzy at all. I have small hands so I got the medium size. There's just enough elasticity to the material to give me a nice snug, comfortable fit. They won't fall off.  It's also easy to handle things with them on.  I haven't washed them yet but I'm sure they'll wash well by hand for at least a few washings.<br /><br />Feb 24 1018: I washed several pairs of the gloves yesterday. I wasn't in the mood to hand wash or baby them so decided to throw them in the washing machine with my dish towels. I dried them in the clothes dryer on medium heat. The gloves came out perfectly. There was no fraying, shrinkage that was noticeable. They came out soft, comfortable, and totally unharmed.  I REALLY like these gloves!!!",

These soaps are aromatherapy grade and if you smell them, you will see why. They smell so wonderful. I love that these soaps are 100% vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, sulfate/paraben/petrochemical-free, and contain no artificial fragrances or colors. What more could you ask for in a soap? In my little gift set, I received four different scented soaps: Sea Breeze, Golden Crown, Green Tea Goddess, and Luscious Lavender. I'm about ready to cry because these smell so good. I'm not even exaggerating. The soaps are naturally colored and I think the colors of each variety accurately reflects the intended scent. The soaps don't over lather by themselves, but I think that's because of being sulfate free. However, I used the Luscious Lavender with a body puff and it lathered just fine. Overall, these are wonderful soaps and this sample set is the perfect introduction to the company and would make a great gift for just about anyone.",

    "text": "My review consists of the good, the bad and the ugly. First,<br />the good - I finally found a curler that 'fits' my eyelid. Huh, you say? Well, it appears that most of the manufacturers believe I have golf balls instead of human eyes. The tool's shape is long and shallow enough of a curve to catch most of the eyelashes. It is comfortable to use, but takes a bit of practice. Once you are comfortable with the scissor motion (sorry, no other way to describe it) used to make the curl, you are rewarded with a nice, non-crimpy curl. The pad in this one is the best I have used. This tool also opens wide enough that even the most nearsighted or lush lashed amoungst us can get it close to the base of the upper lashes. The design over all is very well thought out. I recommend using an magnifying mirror if you have to use bifocals (I do). All that said, now...<br />the bad - there is no replacement pad and I am questioning how sanitary this is going to be in the long run. I agree completely with folks here who advise to REMOVE ALL EYE MAKEUP before use. Ain't nothing pretty about an eye infection. I am wondering out loud how to properly clean this curler to be certain it remains safe. If you are prone to sties and other types of infection, I would be asking the same questions. Which leads to...<br />the ugly - until you practice and are used to it (won't take long) the results are a bit odd looking. The black pad is plushier and looks to be made of silicone and not the usual hard rubber. I have found that the hard rubber pads are chiefly responsible for that weird ugly crimp you can get. Not so with this one. I mentioned before the squeezy scissor action your thumb and index finger have to use can be tricky. If you have coordination issues, well - things could get ugly.<br />SUGGESTIONS for use...wash your hands before use. I keep the little plastic clip to keep the tool closed. You could follow the advise of one person here to heat the tool with a dryer, but I think I may skip that. Use a makeup mirror to assist you. Practice when you have some time. Enjoy, Ladies - get out there and be lovely.",

The negative ions work very well to flatten the surface of the cuticle of each hair, making the hair less likely to break or split, and also softer.<br /><br />This particular brush works well, but the one I received has a minor design flaw: the brush part pops off so easily that I have to hold it tight with my thumb, making it less ergonomic than it might be... not an issue for me. As for the vibrating part, I couldn't tell, but that's not what I bought it for. This brush generates NO heat, which is exactly what I wanted. Unlike some similar products, there are NO seams that could catch the hair.<br /><br />TIPS FOR ALL IONIZING BRUSHES:<br />(1) if they don't need electricity (cord or batteries), they're not the real deal<br />(2) heating elements, just like heated blow-drying, tend to dry out your hair and make it more brittle: even oily hair can get dried out<br />(3) brush your hair SLOWLY to get the best result<br />(4) if your hair is flatter after using it, and you don't like that, bend over and brush it upside down to get more volume",

Now granted, I cannot use most of the colors as I am super fair-skinned but I am able to use most of the left side of the palette.<br /><br />First, I have terrible dark circles. They are sort of a reddish-brown color. The yellow in this palette conceals them better than any skin-toned concealer I have ever tried. It not only covers but also brightens the area too. I also have a brownish spot on my cheek that bothers me every time I look in the mirror. I have tried everything to cover it. I went to a department store makeup counter hoping they could cover it. The makeup counter girl tried for what seemed like an eternity to no avail. She called her manager over to assess my situation. The manager tried to cover it as well, packing more and more concealer and powder but she also could not cover it. She finally said that it was texture and you cannot cover texture. It sounded like a copout to me. It has no texture, it is just a spot. When I apply the yellow in this kit is does wonders for the spot. It is barely noticeable, almost not at all which is better results than I have gotten in the past.<br /><br />I use the green to cover redness that I have around my cheeks and nose area. I just make sure to blend really well and then put foundation over it to get rid of the green. The purple is used to brighten your complexion. Just like with the green, I blend it well and cover with foundation.<br /><br />The best color that matches my skin tone for concealing is the color directly to the right of the purple. For reference I wear MAC Matchmaster SPF 15 Foundation 1.0. Nine times out of ten I am the lightest shade in any foundation. This color matches and is great at concealing.<br /><br />The darker shades are good for contouring but I prefer to use powder contour rather than cream, just a personal preference.<br /><br />Overall I really like this kit. It does a great job of concealing areas that are a constant bother to me. I am including photos of before and afters of my dark circles and the dark spot on my cheek. Hopefully they come out well and you can see the difference.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

    "text": "This Argan Oil hair serum is amazing.  It helps calm my frizzies and provides the hydration my straw-like hair is craving this time of year.  It comes in a 1.69 fl oz bottle with a pump dispenser.  This hair serum smells like lilacs to me.  It is a very lovely scent.  It has a medium consistency to it, not to thick but also not runny.  I have long, fine hair so I start with one pump on my fingers, rub it all over my palms, and apply it to my parched ends.  When there is hardly any left on my hands I smooth the top of my head to tame flyaways.  This serum also gives my hair shine which is another great benefit.  I love this product and I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out.  I think that will be a long time though because I can easily see this bottle lasting me at least a year.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:6e38d17a23354ccb47f63bde906912cf]] This Love It three piece set of tweezers is really handy.  You get a flat topped pair, a slanted pair, and a pointed pair.  This is great because not all tweezing needs are the same.  I especially needed a pair of pointed ones because I tend to have hairs break off when I try to pull them out and these can get to the hair where other tweezers cannot.  This a great little set and I love that it comes with a carrying pouch.  Now I can just throw them in my purse and always be ready if a random hair is caught staring back at me in the mirror when I am out and about.  Overall I am glad that I have them and highly recommend them to anyone needing a great set of tweezers.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

The color is good for seeing where you apply but, The performance of the wax is pretty iffy. I've used it a few times and it just doesn't remove the hair that well especially coarse  hair. I've had better results with those cheap wax strips. Worst is the smell. I'm not sure if it's supposed to smell \"earthy\" But to me it reeks and lingers on the skin even after washing.

The item is made of durable, quality material, and I can see it holding up for years to come. The price compared to other purse organizers is much more economical and I like that it has a bottom-it makes switching purses much faster than if I had to fish out the organizer and then move my loose items.<br /><br />A concern listed in a couple of the other reviews is that the organizers smell-I did not encounter that at all, and I'm very sensitive to smells. The smaller organizer fits into my standard size purses and really does help keep me organized. I wish some of the pockets were of a different size, but overall the organizer fits my needs and I'm very, very glad I took a chance on this item.<br /><br />I bought it through Amazon instead of the TV offer so I didn't have to worry about sneaky S&H charges etc, and as a minimalist, I only need one set, not two, and I certainly didn't need their \"special bonus gift\".",

Remember you're not meant to tip you're head back anymore with stuff running down your face.

    "text": "However, as far as products go... I really love everything about the way this company presents itself, it's design, it's product and how well the product performs. It has a great warranty (my last one from a different company died in less than 5 months with no recourse), and it came with a bunch of great stuff, including this weird little paddle (the green & white thing) I couldn't figure out at first was a cleaning utensil, and now I really love. It helps you pull the hair from the brush.<br /><br />At almost 30 years old this year, I had spent most of my life hating my hair with a passion. I would wear hats, I would wear wigs, I could not figure out anything that could make me happy... and it's because I was completely inept with styling tools and doing anything that wasn't simple.  So I was beyond happy when someone recommended a straightening brush to me in the first place. Then I stumbled upon the best heat protection spray/frizz stuff ever... and I don't know what happened, for the first time in my life, I'm confident with my hair. So if you're on the fence about getting one of these, because you really have tried \"everything\" and you still hate your hair....I don't know, maybe try a straightener brush. All you do is brush your hair with it....and it changes things a lot.<br /><br />This brush though. I can not have enough good things to say about it. It came with everything! A heat protection glove (especially great if you have thick hair like me and need to go all the way up to 450 degrees!), the cleaning tool, a silicone bag to protect it, OH and the cord swivels. I absolutely love the shape and curve of the actual brush, and the sturdiness of the design. I can't see this thing actually needing replacing any time soon, honestly... and that makes me happy because I'm tired of buying stuff on Amazon and having it fail on me.<br /><br />Of all the purchases in the past 2 years on here I've made, this is easily one of, if not the best.... and I wanted to share the pictures of what it does to my hair, so you can see. That is what my hair looks like after being blow dried, and then straightened with this brush, which doesn't take long at all. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and my hair is super thick.",

    "text": "I gave this 3 stars for \"Softness\" because the brush is average to a bit firmer than what would be ideal and comfortable to use on your back, while the loofah strap is average.  The brush bristles are kind of scratchy and not the \"good exfoliating\" kind of scratchy.  They're more like the \"ouch, that's scratching me\" kind of scratchy.  Overall, though, it's acceptable and average.<br /><br />Next, I gave this 2 stars for \"Easy to use\" because I don't find this easy to use.  The brush is separate from the stick that extends it to reach your back; you slide the oval-shaped brush onto the stick by inserting the stick into a cut out section on the back side brush.  The problem here is that it doesn't stay on firmly at all.  I ended up with 2 options:  either not on firmly enough, so it kept popping off, or pushed on so much that it's very difficult to get off of the stick to use separately.  The loofah strap is really easy to use, though.  It's nice and long so there's plenty of length to comfortably hold each end and move it back and forth at most angles, no matter how thin or thick your arms or body may be.  That's a real plus!  But I still couldn't give more stars if only half of the set is easily usable.<br /><br />Finally, I gave this 4 stars for sturdiness because there's no doubt, it seems pretty sturdy.  The bristles on the brush have stayed intact.  The loofah strap is firm and sewn solidly -- but it may be too firm.  It's hard to get flexibility out of it.  The elastic strap handle on the brush is flimsy, but overall, it's a solid set.  The wood is a good, solid, well-finished wood without splits or cracks.  It doesn't seem like a cheap product that's going to warp and break easily if you keep it away from hanging to be soaked when it's not needed for use.  Putting it somewhere nearby where it stays dry is best.",

So I had a vinyl one that lasted longer, but was really just that same old design that was just plastic tied to your head with elastic...<br /><br />This shower cap is... well, frankly, after the other ones I've used... luxurious. The material is not plastic, but more like the soft nylon on my windbreaker jacket. It's much quieter when I'm in the shower, which makes for a more peaceful bathing experience. It is also more comfortable, as the headband is more fitted. It's especially comfortable if you wear it over your ears... there's no pressure anywhere, but it still keeps your hair dry. I, personally, like to have my ears \"out,\" so there is some pressure to the top of my ears where the headband sits, but I don't mind it.<br /><br />The headband does stretch a bit for head size, but not as much as you might be used to if you've used shower caps with elastic bands. I kind of liked this... It makes it easier to get all my hair in it. I flip my head upside down over the shower cap, and the cap just kind of catches my hair like a bucket, and I can just tuck in any stragglers before flipping my head back up. If you need to tighten the headband just a little bit, you can re-tie the bow for a slight adjustment.<br /><br />No shower cap is going to be completely, perfectly water tight. You're always going to get a little bit of water around the edges unless you're really careful in the shower and take pains to avoid direct spray. I use a shower cap when I take a shower before bed and don't want to go to sleep with wet hair... a little bit of moisture doesn't bother me, as I'm not trying to protect a hairstyle or anything. I really just like the comfort and feel of this cap a lot!",

    "text": "So, after being chemo eyebrow bald (and everywhere else bald too) for almost a year due to breast cancer chemotherapy treatments, when my eye brows finally grew back they were mostly white instead of my natural dark brown.  Augh!!  Since I am a second time breast cancer warrior with bigger fish to fry — I ignored my mostly white eye brows for about nine months — hoping they would eventually recover their natural dark brown color after my body recovered from all the chemo poison. Nope. Not happening.  No such luck.<br /><br />The mostly white eyebrows bothered me even more than the flat chest double mastectomy— because well a flat chest can be padded but having invisible brows left me feeling washed out and old.  So, I decided to fix my brows because that seemed like a doable relatively easy DIY thing.  I read lots of  articles on home dying eye brows. Then, based on article recommendations, I found this Godfey product on Amazon and after much research and watching DIY “dye your eyebrows at home” videos, I gave it a go and dyed my eyebrows at home exactly one week ago.  The results:  Yay!!!!  As everyone suggested, I put vaseline around my eyebrows to protect my skin.  I did one eyebrow at a time rather than both at once.  Also, due to my super sensitive skin, I only left the dye on for two minutes per brow.  Still, it worked perfectly.  My eyebrow hairs are still dark brown — one week after I dyed them.  Success!!!<br /><br />I love having my dark eyebrows back, and sort of feel like me again.",

Kind of gross actually, but her feet are looking so much nicer now!  The only issue she had is that the plastic &#34;no mess socks&#34; that come with the kit were too small for her size 10 feet.  She had to squish her feet into them, which left very little room to move her feet inside to work the gel around, which is what the directions say you should do.

I've used this razor each day for 7 days....still think it's great. It's easy to clean, quiet (enough), comfortable to hold and use.

What I was hoping for is when I needed to be clean shaved that I would be able to grab this and get the job done. That didn't happen! I have always used clippers to trim down the initial facial hair, and then come in with either a manual razor, or and electric razor to finish the job to get a super close shave. I don't know if it because my facial hair is so thick, but it required multiple passes on areas like the chin, or the necks and still did not get really close to the skin!!!  I would say this shaver would be great maybe for a person maintaining their clean shave, but not to get that initial clean shaved look! The shaver itself does charge fast, and is easy to clean.",

So I thought I'd throw a review up.<br /><br />I really like the design behind these. You can mount them with screws on a flat surface or corner. And with the included double sided sticky 3M pads, you can do the same without making holes. Plus probably get them on a round pole like a leg of a piece of furniture. The plastic spikes are a good balance of stiff and flexible, though between the two descriptors I'd lean towards stiff. I mounted a couple on my big cat tree (one on a corner and one on the base flat). They obviously blend in fine there. But they're small enough that they would be discrete even if they were put somewhere more out in the open.  My cat likes them well enough. She isn't as enamored with them as I had hoped but I've caught her getting the side of her mouth on them more than once already.<br /><br />Between the cheap price and the non damaging sticky pad option, they're worth trying out if you think your cat would like them. If not, no big loss.",

I've been taking extra time and good care of my hair these past couple of years since I turned 60, and that is why I can say my hair is moderately thick.  I found that a quality shampoo and conditioner help tremendously in maintaining body and appearance.  I brush my hair at least 50 strokes nightly and in the morning at least 25 strokes with boar's hair brush.  The shampoo, conditioner and brushing definitely improved the condition of my hair.  But this Brush with its Pure Wild Boar Bristle and Massage Tip Bristle Combination feels very nice on my scalp.  I personally prefer the round handle and the round shape of the head.  As I write this review, I am buying another, because something this good usually disappears from the market or becomes unreasonably priced.  All my many other Boar's hair brushes will go to storage.
