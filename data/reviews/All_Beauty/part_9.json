I am no makeup guru, but am intrigued with all the contouring I see going on in social media and magazines. I wanted to know more, but needed a tutorial on how to do this for my face. I liked this set because it came with instructions on how to apply correctly for a contour effect.<br /><br />Each palette in this set is made up of a blush like material - there is no foundation or creamy application to it. Each shade is also matte, and does not include any pearly or sheen tint to it.  The directions state to apply your regular foundation FIRST, then use this contour kit, THEN follow up with your regular blush and bronzer.<br /><br />I really loved the brush that was included in the kit. It gave me much better contouring effects than any brush I have used from my makeup set before.  The brush is thick and flat.  Because this is a powder/blush application, this gave me noticeable contouring on my face, without being too dramatic like a foundation contour product might do that requires sponge blending. I was able to blend this powder in as much as I liked, which softened the contour look.  As I get more confident in my application, I won't need to blend it in as much, but will enjoy a little more drama in the application.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great product for someone like me to try out that is just getting started with contouring.  For a more advanced or skilled makeup artist, I'd assume you would want more dramatic effects than this powder supplies.<br /><br />Promotional discount offered for review purposes",

This is a great light. It replaces both my 24w UV bulb lamp and my 9w LED UV lamp.<br /><br />This thing cures Gelish and RCM so fast, and my manis are lasting so much longer without lifting or chipping. Most of the time now, I get bored or my nails grow too much before the polish even shows a hint of coming off. The LED placement is great, and it cures all 5 fingers at once with no trouble. There is a bit of heat, but it's minimal and I'd be surprised if anyone found it painful. I haven't tried the 99s low heat mode.<br /><br />The sensor feature is nice. I was under the impression that I could set the timer to 30s or 60s once and forget it, but so far it seems like I have to choose a time every time. If not, it goes on until you remove your hand. I haven't gone over 105 seconds, so I'm not sure how long it would go for, but it definitely doesn't have a default shut off of 99s as advertised. My open box didn't include a user manual. I'm hoping to find one online.<br /><br />The white of this model doesn't reflect as much light as those lined in silver. But it still leaks a fair amount of light. I'd definitely advise using glasses or averting your eyes. And make sure to keep kids away, because even the reflected light can be painfully intense.<br /><br />It comes off the base for doing pedicures, and while the magnetic components seem to work well and the pieces fit together nicely, I don't polish my toes so I don't use this without the base.",

However I like to carry small purses, so a full sized comb or brush would not work for me. The picture pretty much shows everything you need to know. Folded up it is a little over 4 inches long. Extended, it is about 8 inches long. The tines/bristles on the comb and brush are stiff plastic. The tines on the comb are super close together while the bristles on the brush part are spaced far apart in 3 rows.",

Most have been ok, but  just never up to the same quality of straightening and keeping hair in good shape. UP until THIS one! I was actually quite shocked at HOW close it comes to replicating the smoothness and softness of the much more expensive model. It has almost an immediate heat up,allowing me to start quicker, and because the temp controls are accurate, get finished quicker as well. The grip is not hard on your hands, and it it light and easy to use as well. When you have long hair, that's really important! My ONLY gripe is that the control buttons are in an awkward placement when the iron is hot. but one you use it a few times, you get the hang of where NOT to put your fingers when turning it off. I would also like a lock for when it is still hot. but those are minor quibbles...If you are looking to replace an expensive model, try this one first, you might just be surprised at how much you like it too!",

I really like the metal straw and the 2 different lids they give you.  It is a great price and you get a lot for the price as I researched many other similar cups on Amazon.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I got the silver and it is a great looking cup that you can put in the dishwasher, and it will fit in your car cup holder.

You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning. When you have a good idea of how much to use, you can do it on damp hair. You can mix with coconut oil if you want the benefits of both. Wash it out with a good lathering shampoo after.<br /><br />If you want to use it as a leave in, I recommend just two drops applied to the ends and then the fly aways. I put the drops in my palm and rub my hands together and apply just 2 drops. Unless you have really thick hair you don't really need more. This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.<br /><br />I got a coupon to try this product out for a huge discount in order to provide feedback and an honest review. I am more than happy with this argan oil, as i have tried others and some I was definitely not happy with.",

Less greasy than OTC antibiotic ointments and just as effective. But Vitamin E cream worked just as well.",

I took a chance to try this since other shampoos weren't working all that great and surprisingly it worked amazingly. After a week of trying it both on my hair and mydaughters I could tell a big difference. The texture of our hair was softer and even felt lighter. You could even see a shine on our hair after using it. The feeling of our hair especially my daughters was so soft that there was little to no frizz. My daughter is only 7 and wasn't sure if it would be good on her hair but it seems to be actually helping her hair become more healthier and more easy to manage. I would highly recommend to others.

I've  tried stamping a few of the images and they all are very clear and crisp. I did these quickly on paper. The plates seem to be engraved well. It comes with two different kinds of stampers plus two scrapers. Both of the stampers work excellent.  I would definitely buy these again and others made by Bluezoo.  In fact I will be looking on Amazon for more plates made by them.  If you are new to nail stamping one thing to know is that you must take the protective covering off of each plate, it peels right off.  It takes some practice but once you have the hang of it you will love nail stamping.  I would definitely recommend this set, it would be a good starter set because  it comes with scrapers and stampers.  I would also recommend using thicker nail polish her polish made specially for nail stamping. It seems to be easier to use than trying to use common nail polish which tends to be a little thin and often smears.  I am happy with this product and would highly recommend it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was offered this product either free or at a reduced cost in exchange for an unbiased review of the product. The opinions expressed are my own. I have no connection with the seller other than being an Amazon buyer.  I hope find this review beneficial to you. Happy shopping!",

This one is a bit less expensive than a lot of the competitors and I like that it comes in a large size to refill my pump so that I dont have to buy as often.  Makes my skin wonderful.  Highly recommend.  However, your ad still says it is 100% plant based vegan.  Since it comes from an emu, a bird, that is quite misleading, either the description is wrong or it isnt emu oil.

I only got one Diamond strength and it was silver glitter and only two Xtreme wear in odd colors.  The Diamond strength and Xtreme wear were the reason I wanted this and I only got three bottles total.  A lot of the other products are products I haven't seen before but will remain hopeful they are as long lasting and tough.  You just don't get anything that looks close to the photo. When I got this it said it was the  only one left.  I see it still has \"only one left\".  Just clearing out products and colors nobody buys.

It is a way to express yourself, temporarily! Haha!<br />These are great for kids, too! My girls love them! They love how different they are from their &#34;kiddie&#34; temporary tattoos and they think its so cool when I wear them with them! Haha! As I said above, it is another form of dress up, and what mom doesn't like to dress up with their kids?! It is so fun! And it is interesting to see which tattoos they pick and how they determine which tattoos they are going to wear for that round of dress up! They get so into it! I love it!<br />In addition to the many different designs that are in this set, there are also metallic and white tattoos! Metallic tattoos are so cool! It is like jewelry on your skin! And the white tattoos look really cool in the summer time when my skin is tan! They show up really well for white tattoos, even when I'm not super tan, I was surprised! I really like them!<br />We are definitely satisfied with this purchase, we have had a lot of fun! We will be recommending this product to all of our family and friends!<br />I received this product at discount in exchange for my HONEST review. The discount did not affect my review at all! I take all of my product reviews seriously, whether discounted or not!

I took the boxes out in one photo to show the room available if you need it.<br /><br />On one side you have a smaller zippered comparment which has a thermal lined pocket inside which can hold hot tools such as straighteners and curling irons, and also allows for storage of extra items such as brushes and combs, or miscellaneous items.<br /><br />On the other side there is another zippered compartment which allows for more products, plus has an netted portion which opens to the outside to allow for tissues to be dispensed quickly and easily. There are slots in this pocket also which allow for small tools like scissors, combs , brushes, etc to be stored.<br /><br />the top handle is sturdy and has a nice grip that's easy to hold on to and carry around.<br /><br />I stored my blow dryer and some brushes in the top compartment, straightener in the side compartment, tissues in the other side, and filled all three boxes with makeup products, and then still had plenty of room left.<br /><br />All compartments are extremely easy access, whether holding the backpack with one arm and grabbing something out, or sitting it on a table or chair and unzipping with one hand. I love that the front compartment is velcroed so that once unzipped, it's still easy to close quickly and will keep everything secure until you have time to zip back up.<br /><br />This is fantastic whether you are a makeup artist heading to a show, or just a glamorous girl with lots of products on the go travelling.<br />Even at home this makes for great storage and easy accessibility.<br /><br />FANTASTIC!<br /><br />Product provided for my inspection and review, all thoughts and opinions are my own",

It feels really nice to flip over to the soft, gentle washcloth-like side after using the loofah side on my back.<br />The handles are long and easy to grab onto comfortably, without having to strain and try and twist your body just to clean and get rid of dead skin.<br />I think the soft side makes this much less likely to harden up and become difficult and uncomfortable to use. After several uses, I find it pliable and maneuverable.<br />In my photos, I've added both the scrubber side and the soft side to show the difference.<br />I used some body wash on the soft side to help clean and polish my skin, and have to say it feels incredibly pleasant.<br /><br />*product provided for my opinion and review",

    "text": "My daughter absolutely loves these lace cat ears. She has always been a huge fan of pretending to be a cat and these have helped her creative playing. There is some sparkly black ribbon lace up the sides of the headband to make them look extra fancy. The ears have wire in them and lace stretch over the wire so they are very easily bendable and the lace is thin so they aren't designed to be played hard with but for the price I would definitely order more if need be. These add to any cute kitty lovers and they are look adorable on. The headband is stretchy and doesn't seem like it will easily break and grips the head without being too tight. Vivian has had this on for like a week straight with every outfit and she still look adorable.",

The upper portion that would hold your hair back is NOT elastic, it is thick folded fabric that fans out rather nicely (about the only positive thing to say about this hair band).

I product dispenses easily and is easy to apply to the skin.  It goes on smoothly and evenly, doesn't dry out of make your skin feel tight, and doesn't have a strong or unpleasant odor.  My daughter and I tried the mask together - I have very dry skin, along with some fine lines and wrinkles, her skin tends to be oily and she had a few blackheads and larger pores.  We left our masks on for 15 minutes and washed them off with warm water.  The mask was very easy to remove and left our skin feeling very soft and looking radiant.  An additional bonus for me is the fact that mask contains argan, avocado, and jojoba oils.  Those added oils left my skin well nourished and moisturized.  I applied a light moisturizer because it didn't feel like a heavy one was needed.  My daughter was also pleased with the results.  She had concerns that the additional oils may cause her skin to break out or leave it feeling oily.  The mask washed off her face very easily, her skin felt smooth, her blackheads were gone, and her skin looked radiant.  We concluded that this mask is helpful for any skin type and we are planning another mother/daughter spa day soon.  We both liked the product and plan on continuing to use it.  I can recommend it without hesitation.  It's a great product!",

    "text": "I used this today for the first time and I was pleased with how smoothly it went on.  I also liked the pump to dispense the product so you don't have to put your fingers in the jar and contaminate the product.  I thoroughly cleaned my face, patted it dry, and then applied the product as instructed to on the container.  I received a discount on this product in exchange for writing an honest and unbiased review.  For that reason I feel like I should tell you the cons I found with the product.  The size of the bottle is much smaller than I have anticipated, and I did feel some tingling/slight burning when I applied the product.  The size of the bottle isn't anything I could have been responsible for, but the fact my skin is very dry and sensitive probably accounts for the fact that I felt it might be a little harsh for my face.  I do like this product, though.  I plan on continuing to use it, but only once daily instead of twice.",

If you love makeup like I do and have a makeup addiction, you have to purchase this. Please, you will not be disappointed. I promise. I belong to monthly home delivery beauty club(s), have purchased numerous amounts of all designer expensive eyeshadows, and just love makeup in general. I have found my “holy grail.” I am sure my husband would love to think that I am done buying eyeshadow pallets,  since I have found Stone Cold Fox.  He is gonna be sorely disappointed. I love makeup too much. But as honest I can be, Stone Cold Fox is absolutely amazing. I have ones that I have bought for triple the price and there is no competition. The complements I have received in the past 2 weeks while I have been using this, are uncountable. Plus the shadow lasts all day with no reapplication. I cannot say much more about this amazing eyeshadow. Do yourself a favor, splurge (which it is inexpensive to begin with) and buy it. Pamper yourself. You WILL NOT regret it.",

They were both VERY long, but I cut them in half and there was minimal unraveling (honestly, about 5 strings from the cut edges and it stopped. It's hard to even tell where they were cut now!). AND they rinse absolutely clean very easily. No having to squish them out multiple times like a sponge, and no having to hang them and wait forever for them to be dry (I live in GA, 70% humidity is normal here, so quick drying things are a huge plus for me).",

I unfortunately can't get the looks I want with them because of their size.<br /><br />Also, they are scratchy. I read that you have to hold your brushes slightly different when using natural bristles and not press as hard. I don't know if that is true or not. I have limits to how much I want it to hurt to look pretty, lol<br /><br />I have to use hair conditioner after I wash the natural bristle brushes so that they don't fray as much.<br /><br />I'm keeping them because they look great on my vanity/cosmetic area but I ordered a higher end set of eye brushes that work better for me (JS).",

All opinions herein are my own and are not swayed by the company.<br /><br />I was absolutely ecstatic to receive this product in the mail to try! I am always have issues with my hair. One of these issues is that fact that it ALWAYS lays flat. It is the most annoying thing to me to not be able to make my hair do anything other than straighten it.<br />I am so thankful that I have been introduced to this product because I know I have a new favorite hair-styling product. Zotos is cheap! It's only $12.99 on Amazon. If you're interested, you can also check out their other products on their website.<br />Not only do I love the fact that it definitely makes my hair have more volume, but I completely adore the fact that the smell is amazing! This product has no harsh smells that some hairsprays have. It actually smells like you're getting your hair done in a salon with that amazing hair salon smell that I love!<br />This product is extremely unique because it has a blend of clay and silica. This enables the spray to feel dry as it goes on as well as help build texture that lasts for a whole night of partying, (or whatever you enjoy doing). It's also color safe which is an absolute huge bonus for me!<br />This is a super easy product to use as well. You don't have to have a special type of brush to use it to style your hair. All you do is open the cap, shake the product, spray onto dry hair. I like to blow dry my hair after I put it on because the heat helps me when I'm styling.<br />If you actually want to style your hair rather than just put it on and go, just do whatever hairstyle you want, spray the product, and voila! Amazing hair results in a short amount of time.",

But I recently discovered the technique of using water-based topcoats instead of a UV gel, and decided to take the plunge. I ended up going with this set because of the value - you get so many colors! I'm not as jazzed about the white holos, but hey, why not amirite? I've only used the chrome so far, but it worked great! As great, I assume, as any powder (how different can they REALLY be?), so the details are especially important - like how this set comes with a ton of sponge brushes and those plastic, nail-shaped testers. The powders themselves were well-packed with tight seals; I didn't experience any spillage! All in all, a great product!",

It's very cute and does give the oversized look when wearing it.<br /><br />What I don't like and why I didn't give 5 stars:<br />1. It gets “runs” easily. You can see from my picture there's several “runs” like would happen to a set of tights. When you're wearing it however they're not obvious at all.<br />2. This might be a no brainer because of the size but this is not really a wrist scrunchie, it's so large wrist wear isn't practical. You'll need to either commit to wearing this all day or have some bag or purse to keep it in, this is slightly less practical for daily use then I personally like.<br />3. It's not tight enough to be used alone, you'll need to first use a regular hair tie and then add this for decoration, I prefer scrunchies alone because hair ties hurt after a while but this scrunchie is too slick to stay by itself and would need to be folded over several times eliminating that cute chunky oversized look that this is supposed to give.<br /><br />Although I'm a little let down by the practical use potential of the product, I do like this and will definitely continue to use it for special occasions just not daily wear.",

The kit comes in a pack of 10 and the color variety is good. This is a lot of polishes for the price.<br />2. The colors look the same wet and dry *see video* as well as on the bottle swatch.<br />3. They have lasted very well for me and I work with my hands a lot as well as play guitar often with no pick. This will chip your nails quickly, but this hasn't happened yet.<br /><br />What I disliked:<br />1. This kit does not come with a base or top coat.<br />2. I already have a few base and top coats hanging around the house and the first attempt I made using this polish I used a base and top coat that was not comparable. It would not dry even when under the UV light for quite some time. The second attempt I switched my base and top coat to another brand and it worked. They should really just include the base and top coats if this is a potential for customers. Just keep this in mind if you find the polish isn't drying the first attempt.<br /><br />Given the pros and cons as long as you can find a compatible base and top coat you'll really like this product, if you want to avoid the frustration I'd suggest finding a kit that includes the base and top coats already.",

I really couldn't tell much of a difference between it and my much more costly name brand cream brow filler.

It's like night and day.<br /><br />It's super easy to use and it comes with a little bottle to fill the steam chamber with water. It took less than a minute to heat up and it didn't pull hair or burn my scalp.<br /><br />It is hard to get some of the baby hairs well with it but that's really not a big deal.<br /><br />It has clips to help section your hair into layers and I don't think I've ever been able to straighten my hair so thoroughly so quickly!<br /><br />I was surprised because when I opened it I felt like there was no way it would work on my hair but it was so easy to use!<br /><br />If your hair is damaged I would 1000% reccomend this to help keep your ends from looking fried.<br /><br />It's as affordable as most traditional straighteners and works so much better!<br /><br />Get it.",

    "text": "I tried a more budget friendly at home laser hair removal device a while ago and was less than thrilled with the results, but decided to give it one more try with a better device. I'm glad I did! This is a significant improvement! I wanted to wait several weeks to write my review to see if there were results and after 6-7 weeks of use I'm definitely seeing a significant reduction in hair! The device is super easy to use and instead of having to manually select the correct level of power for your skin tone, the device analyzes your skin tone and makes the selection for you. It literally could not be easier. There's little to no irritation if you use it correctly. If I get lazy and try to use it with any sort of stubble, then it stings a bit. But if I shave prior to use then it's quite comfortable. It's absolutely worlds better than epilating for sure. But that's a different story for a different day. (Ouch.) The one thing that's a little tricky about using this device is that you're not supposed to overlap the rectangle of light, but there's really no way to see exactly where you're placing it because it's up against your skin. Other than that, this is a breeze to use. In the 6-7 weeks I've been using it I've seen probably a 40-50% reduction in hair growth and what is growing is lighter and more fine. I don't expect to be completely hair free even after the 12 week treatment program, but even a significant reduction in hair would be fantastic! Bring on the shorts and tank tops!",

My husband also said he really liked it, so that's a win! The only thing I don't love about it is the cheap looking plastic lid on the bottle. It really cheapens the look of the bottle and doesn't snap on well, which is kind of a pain. I thought about just throwing it away, but then if I travel with the bottle I'm afraid it will spray all over my bag. Other than that, I'm a huge fan of this scent and would order this again in a heartbeat. I can't believe that a fragrance that smells this good, in a bottle and package that looks this great is so reasonably priced.",

I ordered this set because my 3 year old LOVES all things sparkly, so it's perfect for kicking solid colors up a notch and making them fabulous enough for a preschooler. It took two coats to get enough sparkles for her taste. It's kind of tricky to get them even, which for makes my inner perfectionist feel a little crazy, but she's 3 and doesn't care. The sparkles are almost holographic so they are intensely sparkly. These nail colors arrive in a nice box with a foam cutout for each bottle. My only complaint about the packaging is that nowhere on the bottles does it say the name of or show the color. There are color dots included if you'd like to make your own color dot for each bottle, but I would much prefer that it arrive with the color on the bottle already so I don't have to. I don't understand why you wouldn't include the color on the bottle. Other than that I'm happy with these.",

Then I went back and actually read the directions and found that this only dispenses LIQUID soap and hand sanitizer. It will not work with gels. If you want to use gel hand soap in it you will have to water it down until it's liquid. This dispenser is a sprayer, so it doesn't turn the soap into foam, and it doesn't work with gel soaps or sanitizers. If you're ok with only using liquid products then it works as advertised.",

I'm a busy mom and honestly, I just hate going to the nail salon, and who has time to wait for 300 hours (Ok, maybe not quite 300) for your regular nail polish to dry, only to smudge it or have it chip within 2 hours? I had pretty much given up on nail polish and just been resigned to the fact that I would have boring nails forever. This stuff is seriously incredible. You just paint it on, cure it, wipe the top with the cleanser to remove the tacky finish, and VOILA! Perfect nails! I did mine last week with this set and they still look AH-MAZING. When this set arrived, I was a bit bummed to find that there's no color included, just base and top coat. I live an hour from the nearest mall and so I couldn't just pop into the store and get a color, and yet I wanted to try it out... Like, right now. I did some reading and found that you can actually use regular nail polish to make a \"Gel-y\" sandwich. Once you have the base coat on, cure it, then paint your regular color over the top and wait the \"300 hours\" it takes to dry. Then paint the top coat over the regular color, cure, wipe with cleanser and enjoy your stunning, long lasting nails! The only thing I would change about this set is the light. I wound up buying a larger light because the one that comes with this set is quite small and I wanted to be able to fit all my fingers or all my toes in at once. This light is great for storing and being portable, but I personally wanted something bigger. Overall a fantastic set. I'm never going back to regular polish ever again!",

And it's no wonder, with ingredients of coconut oil, papaya extract, and macadamia oil.<br />I tried it a few times on my face (mixed with soap, of course), and it was a little too strong for me. The sugar crystals are large and sturdy, requiring a vigorous scrub to dissolve. It didn't cause me to break out, but I did notice that the rest of the day and the following day, it looked like half my skin got taken off. Dips, discolorations, and small zits that were hiding beneath the surface were all visible - but after a couple of days everything went back to normal. Those of you who have tried chemical or acid peels on your face know what I mean.<br />I get it, if there are that many impurities on my skin, it's a good idea to scrub them away.

I've actually tried using it as a lotion instead because the fragrance is so nice, but it didn't really work out. It's very creamy, though, and when you put a dollop in your hand, it might seem like there aren't any salt crystals in it, because the cream is thick like lotion.<br />There was quite a bit of settling in the packaging when I opened the jar, and since I ended up using quite a bit in the shower, I don't think it'll last very long--perhaps a month. The salt crystals are very small, and when I tried to vigorously scrub, it washed away before I could properly exfoliate.<br />How I recommend using it, in order to get the best use out of the Himalayan salt is to wet your leg before you step unto the shower, so it's a little more than damp. Then take a dollop and scrub your leg, and when you're done with whatever appendages you wanted to exfoliate, hop in the shower and rinse it off. Somehow, when my legs and arms were really drenched, the scrub just slid right off. Less moisture helped it adhere better. The smell really is great and refreshing, and once I've figured out how to use it, I've started enjoying it more.",

It does exfoliate but it is not a hydrating exfoliant with its main feature being it is mostly of a salt consistency. And salt is meant to dry out. If you're looking for an exfoliant to help with ingrown hairs, brighten skin and get out dirt it is a good product. Exfoliant is also great for healed tattoos to keep that new brightness.<br />The smell is great, the consistency of the sand is good quality, and the packaging is very hygiene conscious and comes with multiple sealants so you know no one has opened your product.",

There just isn't much room for hair.<br /><br />So don't think, like I did, that if you have thick hair, you can wear this clip.

Color very much like the picture. Put my hair in 2 small ponytails to help hold it on, put on the net cap that comes with it, “Shake it hard, dive into it” as the YouTube videos say (yes, I did my wig homework) and style with your fingers, mess with the part and using big comb, tame the monofilament. Sometimes add a hair band. Have fooled so many people. Get compliments on my “new haircut”. Going to order a spare!  I would have paid more for this wig but glad I got this amazing bargain!

    "text": "I purchased this for my upcoming wedding. The flower (called a \"fascinator\" in the bridal industry, I'm learning) is very nice, and I will definitely wear it. I may cut the wires with the bling off, but that's just me. I'm having a simple summer picnic wedding with a white, cotton halter dress, and the bling might be a bit too much. I am going to ask my best friend before making this decision. Either way, it's a nice piece.<br /><br />The birdcage veil, though, wasn't really how it's pictured. In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox. The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head. I tried calming the thing down with bobby pins, but it still looked unshapely. Finally, though, after watching the company's videos (they give you a piece of paper with a link to some instructional videos) and keeping it near the shower for a few days to get it to calm down, it did actually look good. I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil's large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening it.<br /><br />I was so worried about the veil that I ordered a separate, handmade birdcage veil from etsy for $30 (see it at pompandplumage.com) that I hoped would be more what I'm looking for. When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn't how I plan to wear my hair. I actually went back to the cheaper veil I bought here on amazon.<br /><br />Whatever you end up doing with the veil portion, the flower/fascinator is nice enough, and cheap enough, that it's still worth the purchase. The flower/fascinators on the same site on etsy where I purchase the other birdcage veil, pompandplumage.com, are $60-$70, and look similar, so even without the veil, this was a good deal.",

Instead, I used this 4% cream that I had purchased for my wife's hand pain. I used the cream for seven days and the pain completely disappeared.

My eyebrows are, like my natural hair, about a level 4 or 5 dark brown, and the grey brown is probably the closest, though the other colors are handy for changes of color to hair and makeup. My brows are thinning, but a little filling in does the trick, and these pens are my favorite tool for the job, as they both color in where you need solid filling and can be used to make feathery strokes for a more natural brow look. This pen came with a useless little razor and three eyebrow \"templates,\" only one of which I might consider useful (if you are new to shaping your brows).<br />The problem:<br />In the past I have received (I see now from other sellers) at least two or three pens for $6.99 to $8.99. I can't believe I paid over $8 for just one pen from this seller \"Generies.\" Going back over the seller page, I see that indeed, by the pictures it appears that one will receive two pens. A sneaky little trick, showing the same photos as the sellers with better deals, but neglecting to include the \"2 CT.\" If you are busy or distracted in the least, you might fall for it, as did I--and doubtless, as have many customers.<br />I really dislike writing negative comments, but am doing this to save others the trouble and disappointment of feeling ripped off. Needless to say, I will be buying this product from other sellers in future--the ones with the more reasonable--and honest--deals.",

It comes with the charging stand, plug, charging cord, little filters that go inside the product and three Microdermabrasion tips. The tip that comes already on the Diamond Microdermabrasion is the normal one, then there is one for sensitive skin, and the last one is a precision tip. When you use this it gently uses suction and the the diamond tips to pull away the dead skin, black heads and even small whiteheads. Afterwards lightly wash your face. It does leave your face a little red but only for a few hours. By the next it was gone. I did have some areas of slight  bruising from going over the same area to often. It wasn't really bruising it was more like a suction mark on your skin but it was gone by the next day. I have used this several times and I absolutely love it. My skin looks and feels much better. This is one of those things that I won't be able to live without. I love it. Had I not seen it on sell, this is one of those things I would have never tried but since it was discounted I am so glad I got it and I think you would have too.

The top of the wig was made in such a way that it looks as though the take a bundle of hair and lay it on the top and sew it on. The best I can describe it is it is like looking at the scrub pad part on the back of a sponge. Matter of fact that is also what it feels like too. A sponge. There are bare spots on the top of the wig where you can see all the way down to the wig cap. I am assuming that is why the top of the wig was done the way it was to cover the those bare spots.

She was expecting an overall diameter of 1\". I think this one is a 1\" heating element, plus the brush, so more like 1-1/2\" in diameter. It still works and she is pleased.

The lavender scent is definitely a stress reducer, and since it's both microwave and freezer safe you can use it hot or cold. To use hot you need to mist a little water on it (but not soak it) and microwave for 30 seconds. To use cold simply place it in the resealable plastic bag and leave it in the freezer overnight. I'm not sure if it really does anything for migraines or not since I don't get them, but everything else the manufacturer claims seems to be true so likely it has some benefits for that application as well. It's best to store it in the resealable plastic bag to make it last as long as possible since the scent comes from lavender blossoms and flax seeds rather than artificial ingredients that can be &#34;recharged.&#34;",

I didn't want a mat - to me, they are too thick and get grimmey/slimey around the suction cups. This was a fun print that is also a good alternative. I had to buy 2 packs (I bought 1 turtle and 1 penguin pack) so there would be enough to fit my standard sized tub.<br /><br />Pros: The colors are vibrant and don't quickly fade (I am writing this review almost 2 months after purchase/install... 2-3 showers are taken daily in the tub where these are located). These stuck easily and have adhered nicely - they have not moved or lifted (i put these in when the tub was clean and dry). My toddler likes that there are animals in the tub. The no-slip surface isn't too rough and it does prevent slips!<br /><br />Cons: I just wish there were more in a package - I had to buy 2 packs which wasn't the worst thing because I was able to get a 2nd print. A variety pack would also have been nice with a few different animal prints instead of all one print but I still love this purchase!<br /><br />Did you find this review helpful? Let me know!",

    "title": "Needs Some Work to Make it work!",
    "text": "This was my first experience with a wig that wasn't from Spirit Halloween and I can't say it was much better. After trying this wig I decided to learn a little more about wigs and I found a ton of info out there about them and how to do a little work on the less expensive ones to make them look better. (ie: thinning them out, plucking the part and hairline, etc.) I also learned about the features of a wig that make it look more realistic, such as synthetic vs human hair/human hair blend, pre-plucked and lace front. Now that I know a bit about wigs I feel more optimistic that I'll be able to find ones that are affordable yet look more realistic and/or that I'll be able to work on them a bit to make them look more so. In summary: The part and thickness on this wig are what I think need the most work. There's virtually no part and the hair on the top is much too dense and puffy. This could be rectified by plucking but the wig is just not worth the work, IMO. The style of it is cute—The length and the waviness of it were exactly what I was looking for. I can't say the same about the bangs but that's the part of the wig that would benefit from some plucking and thinning out. The softness is pretty good for a synthetic wig.  I can't comment on tangling because I didn't keep the wig long enough to see how it holds up. The color is hard to comment on because it looks so different depending on the light—It can look like an ashy light brown with subtle highlights, a darker, less ashy light brown with no dimension to it, and in others it appears to have a mauve-like tinge to it. (You can see the differences in the pics.) In the end I returned this wig and after doing more research I decided I wouldn't buy another inexpensive synthetic hair wig and instead look for a human hair blend that may be a little more expensive but looks more realistic. The bottom line: I recommend not buying this wig unless you know how to work on a wig to make it look more realistic.",

I just want clear skin...is that not too much to ask? Well, after just 5 days, I see a major improvement around my t-zone and chin area that normally breaks out with everything new I try.

This is a really BIG bar of soap that I've cut into smaller pieces so that it last longer. I use it on my arms, legs, and face only. So far, doing wonders.

    "text": "I purchased this for my 7 year olds birthday. We got around to doing it tonite, finally. Overall, we were very pleased with this kit. Make sure the water temp and oil temps are spot on, add them and mix. Let sit, mix, let sit, mix, let sit, mix, etc. I was surprised how simple it was. It's nice how they combine oils and make everything into convenient packets of mixtures. Not having to measure really helps you focus on making the actual product while still keeping my daughters attention. She enjoyed this very much and was so eager for us to be able to stop mixing it and bottling it up.<br />My only gripe is the amount of lotion. We wanted to play with scents, so we used flavor oils we found in our cupboards. But, because they are tiny 2 oz jars, it was difficult to experiment with different scents. We did end up just taking out 2 oz of lotion, scenting, bottling, repeat. But, it was kind of annoying. For double the price of this kit, I saw another kit that makes 4x this amount of lotion. But, I believe ingredient wise, this kit is better. I love that this company chooses a natural preservative and that they use essential oils for scent. (It only comes with 1 scent - lavender) To make this kit better, they should increase the amount of lotion this makes and maybe offer a variety of essential oils to make a few different scents. I also wasn't quite clear on if they used unrefined or refined mango butter, but considering the small amount, it's not a huge deal. For the first timer, this is a great intro to DIY AND THE BEST PART: the lotion is lovely!! Makes my hands so soft and isn't greasy. I'm going to try making more lotions on my own :)  My daughter was so proud and just loved labeling her lotions and giving one to her brothers.",

Also, there are three 60 cc pump bottles.  Each is made of hard plastic and 5.5 inches tall.  They fit very well into a purse or cosmetic bag.<br /><br />I put shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand sanitizer in them.  They are clear, so TSA shouldn't have a problem with it when screening at the airport.  The pump and spray are easy to operate.  One word of caution on the pumps:  The pump attachment does not lock, so I recommend saving the little clip that came with the bottle to keep the pump in a locked position.  In summary, these are good quality pumps and spray bottles for a great price.",

I had no problem having this item on my bathroom wall for over a year. There was no need for concern that it would fall. However, the moment I needed to get it off, it was as though it was going to take the wall with it. Paint and parts of the wall came off and caused damage. So I had to take off the black sheet that had the adhesive from both stainless steel pieces and keep them. It's possible to find some other form of adhesive (like Command hanging strips)  to reapply them to the wall.",

I have olive skin and all the colors are beautiful. I've even used some colors as eye shadow. They are excellent as a base or transition color. Highly pigmented, so a little goes a long way. 1-3/8 square inch of each color. I tap my brush into multiple colors for a more natural look. Also works as a bronzer.<br />Arrived within a week in excellent condition. Product packaging is very plain and and cheap looking, so you will not be taking this with you for touch ups...and the included brush is useless. Who cares! Price and colors alone earn five stars! If I could make an improvement, it would be to re-design the packaging.",

It's also 100% cotton and wrinkles like crazy, so if you don't like ironing, you might want to hang it on a wall when not in use, or roll it up on a wrapping paper tube, or just use it on an altar and never move it.

It gets stuck in the car carpet and the vacuum won't touch it. I use this and it takes it all out. Even after vacuuming my carpet  in the house there is left over dog hair and this tool removes it fast. ANOTHER EXPERIENCE>>> So I washed a new green towel with my robe and there was residue on the dark chocolate colored robe from the green towel... washed it again and it did nothing to remove the green :-( so I thought what the heck lets try it on the robe... all the green was gone! Like I said I have a few of these... some in the barn one in my car and one in my house! Great multi tool !!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 this tool!!!",

But that's the price you pay for larger curls so it's FINE with me, and I will sleep in it.

For me it stays on as well or better than other color brands, goes on smoothly with a pretty good shine to finish & dries quicker than others I've tried. It wears well. No smell.<br /> I'm finally coming to terms with the idea that if a polish is  stronger than a healthy fingernail it will damage a fingernail, healthy or not.

Some are pretty, some are cute, and some are silly, so there's something for everyone. We had a tattoo party a few nights ago and everyone in the family got a tattoo put on the back of their hand. Dad, mom (me), daughter, baby sibling, and grandma. They go on quickly with a little bit of water and only pressing for ten seconds. They look great once applied with very bright colors and unique designs. Dad's was barely scrubbed off the next day in time for work. Mine lasted two full days with multitudes of handwashing and still had to be scrubbed off in the shower. Four days later, daughter and baby sibling still have theirs on and they look great! I would definitely recommend these tattoos for anyone wanting a cute temporary tattoo that lasts a long time.",

This mascara is the FIRST mascara that I've found that truly Elongates my lashes while separating each lash. Because the wand brush has 2 sides to it (a short rubber bristle side and a longer bristle side) I am actually able to get to the BASE of the lashes on my lid and rotate the wand to the longer bristle side to coat each lash while separating them - on the FIRST application!  The result is PERFECT each and every time without the mess, clumping, stickiness, etc that almost EVERY other brush causes.  The other thing I noticed immediately is that since the brush doesn't taper at the end like most brushes do, I actually get mascara on my inner lashes (near the nose bridge) without making a clumping mess!  My current Triple Play has been finished for a while now and I've just been (unhappily) using THIS wand to apply my other mascaras! :-)). I'm so glad Amazon has come through yet again for me!  I'm going to order as much of these as I can find on here. GOOD JOB NICKAK!!",

It gets my blood flowing pretty good and is long enough for me to do my back and use it as a wash cloth. I thought the middle scrubby part on this one would have at least been the same roughness, but it isn't. Also after 1 use, it's already breaking up. Only reason i didn't give it one star is because of the sturdy construction with the rope and stitching. I pulled pretty hard on it trying to exfoliate my back and it didn't break so good job there. Just get a rougher middle and I'll try it again",

I got home and these jems still stayed on for an additional like 4 hours and showed no signs of wanting to come off. Honestly would 100% recommend! They also weren't like single jems that take 100 hours to put on, these came on a strip and you could trim and adjust as needed. As you can see on mine I even created my own look by making the \"teeth\" go up and around my eyebrows while the part that shows to go around the eyes was placed under my eyes instead.",

I quickly realized the LUXE brand has been replaced with another name, that being Jinri.  There are other names for this same style, one of them, Sultra which is SUPER EXPENSIVE ($149.00) for the SAME dryer.  CRAZY<br /><br />The reason this Milanta brand is being returned is because the 1 1/4 brush does not have those little balls on the end of the bristles therefore my hair just slides right off.  If you use your hand to hold the hair in place, of course your hand gets too hot.  The small brush is difficult to hold on the tip, it is slippery, it needs BIGGER Ridges to grip. The Big brush bristles are much better and they DO HAVE the little balls on the end.  BUT the TIP  of the brush does not have a enough space to put your fingers on while you are turning the brush.<br /><br />The picture above shows my old styler brush in the middle and their (Milantia) brushes on either side.<br /><br />Anyway, I found the Jinri on Amazon and ordered that one, it looks exactly like the one I have.  1000W is the same as my old one.

Plus it doesn't make the area where I apply it  itchy like other brands do. My eyelashes are longer, but not thicker so I knocked off one star. Buy it!!!<br />Update- Sept 13- Eyelashes are a bit thicker too. Some itching occasionally on my eyelashes for a few minutes after I apply it. But they are slightly longer and slightly thicker!!! So I have changed it to 5 starts. The effect is subtle and natural, not like having fake bushy eye lashes so please have realistic expectations or you will be disappointed",

It comes with a step 1,2, and 3 with the mask itself being step 2. First you use step one \"Export Black Heard \" which helps pull the black heads out of your skin and it does a really good job on its own- I acutally bought this set twice for the first step alone! MY bottle tipped over without the lid on (thanks to my awesome toddlers!!) and I almost immeadiately ordered a whole new set. I could see results before even putting the mask on just from the prep. When you put step 2 the mask on your face you want to make sure that you dont make it too thick of a coating because it will take longer to dry (but this one still will unlike a lot of peel off masks that end up being scrub off because they dont ever harden and do what they claim they will. The third step is also a really good one it closes the pores to prevent them from immeadiately accumulating dirt again. The instructions are in a foreign language, but there isnt too much going on here that is too copmlicated to understand.  I like how my face feels clean after usinmg this",
