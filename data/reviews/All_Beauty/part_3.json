    "text": "I got this razor for my daughter but ended up keeping it because I liked it so much. First of all the handle is a heavy duty handle with some weight to it . I like that. It also has a magnetic feature to change the blades . I was worried it would fall off when shaving but it stood firm. The magnetic feature makes it super easy to change heads. Unfortunately I didn't  see any replacement heads to order on Amazon. I would have liked the kit to come with more heads,  it comes with two, one to use and one replacement . I really like the aloe strip that surrounds the 5 blades , most of my other razors it's just on one side. The razor cuts close and is comfortable to use. It also comes with a ceramic base to hold it . It looks great and simple while being stored.",

    "text": "This is a good water flosser . I'm comparing it to others I have owned. The last one I had did not last long- this appears to be better made and it just looks nicer overall. The water well holds a fair amount of water however I would like it to hold a bit more. It has many levels of power for the water to spray out. The low is very weak and the high is pretty darn strong and could be painful if you aren't careful. There are plenty of adjustments in between so you will find one that suits your mouth just right. It also has a “massage “ button which basically cuts down the strength of the jet and makes it pulse to massage your gums. I find it a bit too soft of my gums , even on the highest level.  This product does a great job in cleaning between your teeth and below gum line. I hate to floss so this is a great option to keep my teeth clean and well cared for. If your house is Not new and only has one plug in your bathroom, you will appreciate the long cords- both the electrical and the water hose. One thing I like about this water flosser  is that it does NOT leak like my other one did. This keeps my counter neat. This is a good product to add to your daily dental hygiene regimen . It is easy and does a great job cleaning .<br />* If you found this review helpful please click the button below to let Amazon know. Thanks !",

    "text": "Eeeeeeekkk I'm so excited about this!! I love my Dry Bar Buttercup hair dryer, but really wanted a diffuser for it because I like to scrunch my hair time to time. When I added it to my cart, it was $21 I believe. That's still cheaper than Sephora so I was going to get it but waited. SO GLAD I DID. Randomly, it dropped to $12.12!!!! Purchased immediately!!<br /><br />It fits my hair dryer perfectly. But, I can tell by looking at it that my hair dryer isn't a standard size on the end so I had to purchase the Bio Ionic brand since that's who makes my hair dryer. Worth it! It says universal, but I would still take measurements to make sure it'll fit yours if it isn't a Bio Ionic brand because they are not ever all universal.<br /><br />The part that attaches to your hair dryer is not a hard plastic- it is rubbery (but firm) so it slides onto your hair dryer but doesn't &#34;click&#34; into place. I think that's why they say it's universal because this allows for some difference in the size of your dryer. But still do your research and compare your hair dryer to the size of the Buttercup hair dryer because it fits it perfectly.<br /><br />You can also twist the diffuser to open up the vents or close them to control the air flow (see pictures). There will always be air flow on the outer ring of the diffuser, but you can completely close off the center, which is nice if you don't want a ton of force.<br /><br />I love it and it was completely worth it!",

Mine came in perfect condition, not at all scratched like you can read in some reviews for these. I use this day to day when I need to lay out some foundation for application or to put some powder on before applying to my face. It keeps all of my bottles from being contaminated when applying product. It's been a wonderful addition to my kit!<br /><br />Edited to add: I noticed that there are many reviews on here that are coming from people that have gotten this discounted/free in exchange for a review. I am NOT one of those people. I purchased this on my own, with my own money, because I needed a spatula and plate to use for cosmetics. So, please trust that my review is honest and give it a &#34;YES&#34; for helpfulness! Thanks so much!",

I'm happy to say, I was wrong, and pleasantly surprised by how well it actually worked! This set comes with two strong clips for helping you separate your hair and a cleaning brush.<br /><br />You'll need to start with clean, dry, and tangle-free ( as much as possible) hair for best results. If you want to change the temperature setting from Celsius to Fahrenheit just press down on both temperature buttons at the same time. Also, They have temperature recommendations based on hair types; 410°F-446°F (210°C~230°C) for fine hair.<br />374°F-410°F (190°C~210°C) for normal hair.<br />338°F-392°F (170°C~200°C) for soft hair.<br /><br />  What I really like about this brush:<br />1. It gives my hair a more natural-looking straight hair versus my flat iron.<br />2. It's very easy to use.<br />3. The bristles are very long which keeps the heating element away from your fragile scalp. I never felt my head get hot while using it.<br />4. I could safely and easily use this brush on my oldest daughter to tame her hair craziness. I wouldn't say that about my flat iron.<br />5. This brush would work for most hair types. My underneath layers of my hair are very thick, coarse, and extremely curly while the top layer is thinner, and just wavy.<br /><br />  My dislikes:<br />1. The control buttons are placed very inconveniently on the brush handle making it very difficult to not accidentally change setting while in use.<br />2. The bristles are long. This makes it safe to use, but difficult to tame those little flyaways that are very close to your head.<br /> 3. This isn't a problem for my hair, but from my use of this product I don't think it would work well for those that have spiral curls.<br />4. The back side of the brush also gets extremely hot; be careful!<br /><br />  Overall, I really like this brush and feel it is well worth it's price! I will still keep and use my flat iron for special events, but i know I will use this brush for everyday styling.<br />  I received this product in exchange for honest feedback. The opinions expressed in the review are solely mine.",

Ive used Honest Amish, and a local beard oil, but my girlfriend didn't like the smell of the H.H. and the oil just wasn't enough to keep my beard in check.  This My Best Beard beard balm fits perfectly!  It has a nice smell and my girlfriend loves it too!  My beard is also noticeably softer after just a few days!  I really enjoy this beard balm and I plan on purchasing from PureSouth Naturals in the future.  The Beard brush that is included in this kit is also really nice.  I haven't had any bristles come out while using it and it feels nice on my beard.  Plus it comes with the nice carrying bag for when you go away from home!  Overall, this is definitely the best beard/balm/wax Ive used and I recommend it.",

Im sure its from years of outdoor sun and tanning bed periodically in my 20s. Really didnt care about the long term effects. Now im dealing with that and redness on my entire face. I've been using this for about 3 days now after a shower when my pores are opened. I can't say i have seen any results yet but of course its too soon. I can tell you that this does not leave my face oily at all! Skin feels cool and dry after immediate use. I really hope this works for me. I really wouldn't care how much it costs as long as it works but the price is awesome! I will update after 1 month. I didnt realize you need to use it 2 times daily so i will start with that tomorrow. High hopes!",

If this product was indeed EWG verified, it would not only be on the website but it would have the EWG logo on the product plus it wouldn't have linalool which is high on the allergy list.<br /><br />Other than the linalool, this has decent ingredients. It is silicone free, paraben free, sulfate free and alcohol free. I would stay away from this product if you have malassezia (fungal) acne as olive and japonica may be triggers and/or pore clogging.<br /><br />Like all natural bar shampoos, it won't lather like traditional synthetic shampoos but it does clean. It takes some getting use too and a period of detoxing for your hair to get use to the change in chemicals if you are switching from synthetic to natural but it is worth it!<br /><br />I would recommend this shampoo bar however I am rather concerned about the EWG verified claim.",

I hate using heat products so in order to use most extensions, I have to straighten my hair which I don't like. I just need some volume, not length so I cut these which was really easy. All you need is a sharp pair of hair cutting scissors and a pony tail holder. Put the pony tail holder where you went to cut and cut away. It isn't a perfect like which is good to help blend.",

The ones that are in English, Solanum Melongena which is an eggplant extract, EDTA which is a chelating agent and not good for you at all, Camellia Sinensis Leaf which is a skin conditioner and perfume and CI 77492 which is a synthetic cosmetic colorant. There is a -20 which typically is a PEG which Polyethylene Glycol and can cause health issues if used in excess.<br /><br />The application of the product itself is a neat concept and makes applying a mask much easier. There are unnecessary perfumes and colors in this product along with EDTA and possibly PEG which I stay away from.<br /><br />Learn your skin and what it can handle also what you are looking for in a skin.

    "text": "Overall, this product isn't horrible compared to others on the market. It is paraben-free, sulfate-free, EU Allergen free and uses minimal ingredients however it also contains alcohol, silicone and is not safe for fungal acne.  After running this product through a cosmetic ingredient safety checker, it scored an 88% one the EWG Health Rating.  Most popular, name-brand face lotions are around 65%-80% on the EWG Health Rating. I use the EWG (Environment Working Group) as a reference when checking products and try to stay away from the alarmist side. Only 8% of this product is considered “moderate risk” mainly polyarylamide, Fragrance (unnecessary additive; possible allergy) , alcohol denat. (Bad for dry skin, bad for sensitive skin, potentially block pores) and BHT (also found in edibles, rubber products and is banned in UK and EU due to limited research showing BHT is linked to cancer). This product is good for brightening, anti-aging and promotes wound healing.  It also contains steric acid which can potentially block pores.<br /><br />Keep in mind, everyone's skin is different and what effects one person may not effect another. Learn your skin and what products work best for you. Personally, I would stay away from this product if you have very dry skin and/or sensitive skin. I have “normal” skin (no sensitivities, not overly dry or oily, limited acne, no allergies) and didn't have any issues with this product so far. It has a light scent that isn't overpowering but completely unnecessary (I HATE fragrance in beauty products; stick with essential oils). It absorbed nicely and didn't leave my face feeling oily. I am giving this product 4 stars as of February 21, 2021 due to the minimal ingredients and will update this review once a larger amount of time has passed to fully understand how to works with my skin.",

I've had this product since January 13, 2016 and the beginning of this month the callus remover strip has start to break way. I would have updated earlier, but I forgot. I still use it and I still like it, but my 5 star has dropped to a 4 star because the longevity of the product. It probably should not be pulling away so soon. I keep it up right so it's not hitting any water after my shower.<br />-----<br />I have been so needing one of these. I have tried others but sad to say they were not as rough as this one and let me tell ya, I truly need a rough one. My feet are pretty dry. I love going for my pedicure's but the cost can add up. I would much rather just do it myself.<br /><br />So, needless to say, I got a chance to try this one out and I have to admit, it's &#34;great&#34; It's perfect for &#34;me&#34; I have a home pedicure system. I soaked my feet for thirty minutes then I took this wooden foot file and went to work on my super dry feet. WOW, it worked wonders.<br /><br />I was going to put a picture up, but I'm sure no one wants to see my callus feet with dead skin. That's just gross. As far as longevity, well, that's up to you. You can wash these with hot water, but after a while, you will need to throw it away and get a new one. As far a price does, I have seen this same size at a brand store for a few dollars less. But you will have to actually go to the store and buy it, when you can order right here on amazon<br /><br />❤️ PRO:<br />• it's large<br />• does good at removing tough dried skin<br /><br />💔 CONS:<br />• the suction does not hold<br /><br />✔️ Overall: It's a good callus remover. It works for me.",

    "text": "I received my new Argan Oil shampoo and was super excited to start using it. I have thick natural, healthy, unprocessed shoulder length hair. What I noticed with this shampoo was first of all it took a lot of shampoo the first time I washed it (one of two times) to get my hair to lather. Since this is organic I was not surprise to find this, but disappointed that it seemed to take so much shampoo. My fix the second time I washed my hair was to use a different shampoo for the &#34;starter wash&#34; and to use the Argan oil for the final wash. I LOVE how the shampoo smells and how it looks when I've finished blow drying and styling my hair. My hair is quite thick and can get kind of frizzy and have fly aways which did not happen with this shampoo. Typically I cannot wash my hair everyday, as it usually takes a couple days for my hair to &#34;fall&#34; and not look so &#34;big&#34;. Fortunately, my hair looked great immediately with this new shampoo. I also washed my hair before a house party for New Years and had MANY compliments from various family members over the wonderful smell of my shampoo. Several requests were made by my mom, sister, sister in law and niece to tell them the name of my shampoo. It has a fresh spa like scent and appears to be a cross between a bit of honey and vanilla in the fragrance. I LOVE this shampoo and was very excited to have the opportunity to review this product for my unbiased opinion.",

This Shea Butter Hand Cream comes in a beautiful box that is tightly wrapped in plastic. When you open the jar you are greeted by a pleasant aroma - hard to describe, even though it says it has lavender as an ingredient I did not really smell lavender as a smell. The cream is thicker than normal hand lotion but not super thick and it does not feel greasy, it feels nice and quickly absorbs into your skin. I received this product at a discount for my unbiased opinion and really like this product. I especially love shea butter and that this shea butter hand cream is made of all natural ingredients.",

    "text": "I have type 3A hair (naturally curly, coarse and thick) cut into a pixie style. I wear my hair straight more often than not and blow dry with 2 different size round brushes. Since my roots are very curly, I need a smaller flat iron to get to the roots since my hair is short. I've tried using a regular size and it's too large to reach my roots. I've tried probably 6 different flat irons and this one I actually saw on an Instagram post. It doesn't have a temperature setting; you turn it on and that's it. However, this thing gets HOT! The way it feels in your hands is perfect, it's not awkward feeling. The fact the handle is a little thicker makes it easier to hold and it also has grooves so you're able to grip it well while straightening. This is the best flat iron for shorter hair styles!",

The magnetic liner works well but it must be applied pretty thick in order to give enough area for the lashes to stick.  You have to be careful when placing them also as  you cannot really adjust the position because pulling the lashes off usually tears the liner off with it, so you have to then clean the lashes and reapply liner if you make a mistake which is kind of a hassle.  The two lashes included here are nice but neither one really worked for my eye shape, I got another kit which had 7 different shapes in it and that one had two styles that work well for me so I would probably recommend getting one with more options to ensure you find one that fits your eye shape.",

(These are very serious scars from being attacked by a box cutter about 8 years ago.) Bio Oil is evening out less substantial scars that weren't faded by Maderma. I'm now into my second trimester and my body is starting to grow. My old scars are continuing to fade substantially and I haven't developed a single stretch mark. I will write a follow up review regarding stretch marks in another three months when my pregnancy body is a bit more.... Yeah",

After using this, my hair feels amazing. Smooth and has a nice slip to it. No more kinks. I think the best part is that this doesn't wash off. I'm not sure how many showers I have to go through before I have to reapply, but I can tell one tube will last me for a while. After you shower, grab enough of this to cover a thin layer in your hair and then blow dry. It will feel sticky and tacky but once your hair is completely dried, it will just feel like smooth silky hair. If you feel you put too much in one area, put some water in that area to thin the cream and then blow dry again.<br /><br />I really wish I found out about this product before I chopped off my hair.

I am male and have sensitive skin that's prone to irritation that results in random pores getting clogged on my arms or chest or legs.  I bought these on a recommendation to test out and see if they helped.  I've only had them for a few days, and can't really say yet if they've done anything for my pores or not, but they do seem to be doing a really good job at exfoliating my skin.<br /><br />The individual towels are roughly 12 inches wide by 24 or 30 inches long.  They're made of some sort of woven nylon or plastic material that is kind of wavy and extremely abrasive when rubbed across the skin.  You use the towel by putting a dollop of liquid soap onto it and then rubbing it onto your body to create a lather.  The towel is long enough that you can easily scrub your back by holding the ends of the towel and pulling back and forth.  The towels are abrasive enough that it really feels like you're scraping a layer of skin off.  Probably not appropriate for use anywhere sensitive.<br /><br />I'm loving these so far.

The two pieces lack the fancy features of more expensive pieces, but my dentist says all those extra features are not worth the money. The toothbrush works great and the only feature my dentist recommends is the 2 minute timer to make sure you give yourself enough time to brush all your teeth. I've always used string floss in the past, but this water flosser seems to work just as well most of the time. Sometimes there is some food stuck in my teeth that I still have to use the string for.<br /><br />As I said, features are minimal. There is 1 charger for both devices, so you can't use the charger as a stand for both items. Instead of all the cardboard in the box, why not include a cheap plastic tray or stand? There also is no travel case, just a little cover for the toothbrush head. I would really prefer a full length hard case to be included instead of having to buy an aftermarket case that doesn't fit well. Also, you only get one tip each for both the flosser and the toothbrush and there is nowhere to easily store extras. This kit is probably designed for single people only, not couples or families.",

I continued to search and learn about high gloss, matt's, waterproof and plumping, supple and antiaging recipes and I am now ready to give this a try.<br />It all looks pretty basic, even cleaning the mold.<br />Right now I have my favorite (not necessarily healthy) Chapstick in every room, all vehicles, and in my purse for constant dry, hot, freezing, desert weather protection and I can't wait to replace them with my own tints, and colored lipsticks.",

OK, the rose water or whatever they're packed in smells nice, and they feel OK on your eyes, but so does a cheap ice mask, which gives better temporary results...not to mention, positioning these super thin, slimy gizmos is a pain in the butt.  Eventually, you'll get them to stick and assume all that work will pay off.  I have bags under my eyes, and after using these five times (every other day) there's not even a 0.1% difference. I even tried them first thing in the morning when my eyes were at their worst.  This is the placebo effect at its best!",

They do a great job at filing natural nails without all that ear splitting, teeth hurting, grinding noise other glass files make.<br /><br />As far as buffing/polishing goes, yes, they do make a naked, natural nail shiny.  But unless your nail is free of bumps, humps, divots, etc., it's going to take a long time to shine the nail evenly. What you end up doing is making thin/weak spots in the nail which will cause breaks or cracks as the nail grows out because these files take off a lot of nail. You can get shinier nails quicker with a base coat.",

The stamper works great, I didn't even wash it first (even though you should always wash new stampers before first use), and it's slightly (I do mean slightly) softer then other clear stampers I own.<br /><br />If you're new to stamping or not familiar with clear stampers, they are more delicate than opaque ones and tear easily, so be gentle with it. Wash it with dish soap & warm water, dry with a paper towel and clean it with a lint roller or tape. Never buff it or use acetone, you'll make it cloudy defeating the purpose of a clear stamper. When picking up, ROLL GENTLY over the image if you apply too much pressure it won't pick up. When applying the image to the nail press straight down (again, with GENTLE pressure) and rock side to side or roll from side to side. Don't push the tip of the nail into it, it will tear.<br /><br />All the plates stamp great, I didn't swatch every image, although plates 29 & 41 have shallow etching (in my experience this is normal for BP plates) so the thinner scraper is a nice addition. It's not as thin as the 0.5mm and not a thick as the 1mm ones I own, I'd say it's 0.75mm (I didn't get out the calipers). There are different size images, a little for every nail size. But I do wish the water marble designs were bigger, I'm not a Water Marble Witch yet. Plate 52 is great for lead lighting or Sharpie water coloring.<br /><br />The stamping guide works like it's supposed to, I've added a photo to show how it's used just in case it's confusing. I have a set of 4 templates from another brand already, there's not much difference in size or thickness of the metal but the designs are different. The edges aren't finished, like a plate with no backing, but I don't think it would cause anyone to slice their finger open unless you're being extremely careless.<br /><br />All in all a great set.",

    "text": "&quot;Jeff's Wife&quot; - This is not true to color, it dries quite a bit darker, as you can see from the pic, but since I only use it for nail art I don't care but some of you might. I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.<br /><br />If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out. This 4 oz bottle will last you a very long time, I still have about half the bottle I bought in Feb. 2015, and costs a fraction of the price as those other brands marketed specifically for nail art.",

I've only heard negative things about the original stamping polishes from BM so I don't own any, I've only used MdU. But when BM reformulated their stamping polishes I gave them a try and I now own all the new collections so I gave these a try too. Boy am I glad I did. These DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I don't own white stamping polish, I use Sinful Colors Snow Me White that has been open for 3 days, it works but it's still not proper stamping polish. The black I use is MdU, the absolute holy grail of stamping polishes. But I have to say that these are beyond good! This black is comparable to MdU black in every way, except the smell. These have just become my favorite! I don't think I will be ordering from anyone else anymore.",

One is that four of the six sleeves are cracked in the corners, like it's old, dried out plastic but I guess it's nothing that some packing tape can't fix. I've never had this issue with the other five sets from them. The other issue is the holder feels a bit more foam like instead of the pleather like the previous ones.

In the videos I watched, there was a considerable amount of icky skin removed- literally piles of it! My experience has been much less dramatic. A whole face application resulted in just a tiny amount of \"dust\" to be removed. I applied a bit too much pressure at first and gave myself a little scratch, so do be cautious. These blades are sharp!<br />I feel that my skin does look brighter and more healthy. Those videos of dermaplaning likely feature models who had been tanning and not washing their faces so the dirt and oil really built up, and skin was ready to peel.<br />This product removes tiny \"peach fuzz\" hairs but I also tried it on a small patch of coarser leg hair that I had missed while shaving.

With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again.

I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable.

This spread thicker than other foams I have used so far. It felt like it did a good job cleaning and left my skin soft and fresh. The price is on par with other foam cleansers I've tried.

I have used these, just got back from a short trip, and they will be going with me to Spain in 2 weeks for holidays. They do what they say they will, easy fill, click dial for the label, squeeze every bit out, no leaks. The zip bag ripped on second use. That was no bother to me,I didn't need it. EXCELLENT seller communication!  After purchase, I received an email to see if I was pleased, wrote back that I was, except for the bag, and described. Seller thanked me for honest input and is looking for a new supplier of more sturdy bags. Kudos to this little shop, I hope they do very well in the big Amazon world. Great customer service. Beyond the quality product, I would go out of my way to do business with this seller again.",

Kept one, will be giving the other two away with nice shower stuff as gifts, then will order more for myself. I wish I had of found these years ago.<br /><br />Adding to previous review- I am finally ordering another 3 pack. I gave away 2 of the first 3 pack as stocking stuffers to family. Now everyone in my family is talking about these and wanting them. *Please note, if you have really sensitive skin (like me) these work great, just remember don't scrub as hard as you would with your everyday pouf ball thing. These do the exfoliating job just great without lots of pressure. Also, mine has held up beautifully. I throw it in the wash and air dry, still looks new. I really love how I can use on back. I know it sounds silly to get this lathered up (hahahaha) over a product, but this is a game changer.",

I give it a slight edge over my old one because the rose quartz is pretty. I'm not sure if it is anti-aging because I don't really pay attention to that. If it is having an effect, then great, but for me, the rolling action helps me wind down at the end of the day. The motions are soothing and quartz is cool against the skin. It is easy to clean and it keeps well too. With the two roller bottles, it does make a nice gift set. But this is a set that I'm keeping. Hopefully this one doesn't disappear.",

Given the teardrop design, it probably can be used with a powder based item like eye shadow, but I prefer to use it for foundation blending/application. I like how sponges can use a bit of water with the foundation to help with spreading the foundation on the skin and this sponge does a nice job of this. The foundation goes onto the skin so it looks sheer, fresh and polished. It also does a good job of blending so concealer conceals but doesn't appear obvious. I like that is easy to clean and doesn't have the \"make up sponge\" smell. If anything makes me stop using a make up sponge, it is the rubber-y used smell that it can get, but this sponge doesn't have that smell so I'm glad of that.<br /><br />Overall, it is a nice makeup tool to have in the make up box.

I'm sure you could but it really is good for fine hair. It does have a strong perm solution smell that lasted through the first shampoo, but since it is so good with my hair, it is a small price to pay.  It is important to do a test curl if your hair is a bit longer in order to ensure the bottom curls as much as the top. I didn't time it right last time and the bottom of my hair didn't curl as tightly as the top. A test time would have helped. Still, overall it is an excellent perm for thin delicate hair.",

As I've gotten older my skin has gone from mixed to quite dry, and this facial moisturizer just ends the flaking and itching, just stops it dead.<br /><br />I can't say if there's an anti-aging effect going on here since the only place my age shows on my skin is on my face, but if the way my skin feels after applying it is any indication, I'm getting younger by the day.  It's a generous 3.4 oz of cream for your money, and you don't need to apply a lot to get the bene fit.  So if you have dry skin anywhere on your body, I would say don't hesitate to try this stuff.

My one worry was that it would not actually stick to the slightly uneven marble tile surface.  I was also a little worried that the image would be warped and ultimately unhelpful.  I have had this now for about a year and it has held up beautifully.  It fits in the space perfectly, has a nice modern and clean look that blends into the slightly grey tone of my marble tile and most importantly, stuck without any problems (make sure to stick to clean DRY surface), even with small fingers poking at it.  NOTE that I cannot really comment on the other reviewers' comments about fogging.  It has never fogged up for us, but our placement doesn't really lend to anything fogging to begin with.",

It can work plugged in, or with battery, which should give you about 40 minutes of time per charge.<br /><br />The shears are sharp and do a great job of cutting through my thick hair. The attachments are also very nice. Unlike other units that have 6 or 7 different guards depending on what you want to do. It has a fixed length one, a short variable one, and a long variable one. For my hair she used the short variable one.  The settings go from 1/16 of a inch up to about 3/4 inch, and the long variable one goes up from there.<br /><br />Having the variable length guards is great as it reduces the number of guards you need and allows you to change lengths on the fly.<br /><br />Using the shears without the guard is also good for trimming to the skinline, edging and shaping.<br /><br />The only complaint my wife had is that she wishes it were a little more powerful on battery, but wasn't really lacking in power, it is just that she usually uses professional shears. This unit is actually as powerful or more powerful than most shears you buy at walmart or the like.<br /><br />Overall a great shear for home hair cutting.",

The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess. You don't make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.<br /><br />The trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand. It has an detachable cord that allows the unit to be charged. It can operate on the cord or off it's batteries for cordless use. The trimmer is NOT submersible.<br /><br />The attached guard can be adjusted to 9 length settings with a rotating selector. It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas. There is also a separate smaller attachment that can be used for precision cuts.<br /><br />The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the \"Turbo\" button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal. There are still a few hairs that don't get sucked up but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.<br /><br />The only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small. There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of it.<br /><br />Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards.

    "text": "Quickly approaching (a still, sadly, rather vain) age 40, I have personally spent a small fortune over the years trying to slow the aging process and reverse the effects of too many days spent gardening without sunscreen.  I cannot even begin to list all the products I've somewhat foolishly gambled on to get my skin looking better.  This product--and several other products offered through the company NEOTERIC (all under the Alpha Hydrox brand)--are exactly the answer I've been looking for.  I've used them both alone and in conjunction with a more expensive brand of anti-aging products (for which I've also left good reviews on this site), and I can see great improvements both ways.<br /><br />I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy cream after reading in Dr. Oz's (and Dr. Roizen's) book [[ASIN:0743292561 You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You)]].  I'd tried several other alpha hydroxy products before this one (i.e. ROC, etc.) and must say this particular line (ALPHA HYDROX) is far superior to any other I've used.  That it is also apparently considerably less expensive than most is icing on the cake, in my book.<br /><br />Regarding this product, I find the key is to use it AT LEAST once a day, and always after using a mild cleanser.  At my age I still get acne and, despite my sometimes manic picking, I notice it (and any residual puffiness or redness, and resulting scarring) clears up much, much more quickly than it used to.  Also, my skin breaks out much less than before I used this.  The tone and color of my skin are far improved when compared to prior to using this product.  I've run out of it before and tried to use something else until I was able to locate more locally, and to my dismay the condition of my skin began to deteriorate.<br /><br />I won't try to insult anyone by saying the Alpha Hydrox line will remove every wrinkle or fix all your skincare woes.  If there is a product out there that does this, I want to know!  But for now, this is by far the best line of products I've used.  I use this item, particularly, with the line of skincare I reviewed previously, as that seems to address reversing the signs of aging better (where this one, for me, just improves the overall condition and appearance of my skin).",

It's not overly sticky, so I didn't find it bothersome.<br /><br />Applies smoothly- it does feel like a velvety, whipped texture<br /><br />If you're concerned about the appearance of lines on your lips with a liquid lipstick- I feel this is one makes them a bit pronounced.<br /><br />Overall, for a liquid lipstick, I think it's pretty good.

You can of course see some bumps but blending the color with my skin, it's not noticeable. It also helps to heal them and I've been getting less and less and the year went on. Now I use more sporadically, to hide what scars are left but this product seems to help them fade! If I apply it when I feel one coming on, it helps to reduce the inflammation and rids it quicker. That could really be because there is green tea in it.  My daughter uses it to hide her teen acne and in fact my son puts a teeny tiny drop on his cystic spots as well to tone down the redness.

    "text": "My husband used this kit and took, when asked to do a bit of a review on it for me, took it very seriously. The price isn't cheap so he wanted to make sure to really look at everything as he used it. Here is what he had to say:<br /><br />\"You have a pack of accessories here so I thought I would run through them in turn to tell you what you are getting and my impression of it<br /><br />Shampoo and body wash.<br />Okay, I ran through this way too quick and used all of it. It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.\"<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set. He's still talking about it so he did like it, just thought it was a bit much.",

The conditioning was just not quite enough on the ends of my hair. Great on the already healthy stuff, just seemed to ignore the drier ends. Figured I'd get that over with and move on to the good stuff.<br />This really gave my hair a nice shine to it. My hair is getting old with me and it no longer wants to be as manageable and tame as it once was. With this duo of delight my hair looked healthy after it dried. It looked good when left to air dry, when dried with the hot air brush, and when left to air dry. It looked shiny without the added matching shine spray (which is also a wonderful product) and with. I left out the word smooth in this so far but let me tell you! It was also smooth and sleek without having to use other products to make it stay that way. Granted, under all that grey old hair there has always been fairly thin straight hair so this just really put it back to looking like it used to in that regard. The shampoo cleaned it to the point of being squeaky clean as well.<br />Give this duet a try if you can. It works really well and smells alright to boot!",

It's hot and it becomes humid under the mask. Perfect breeding place for acne. It was forming all around my mouth. I'm not going to complain about it. Just that's how it is now, and we have to work with it.<br />This serum seemed to be working at first. It's easy to apply using the dropper. Just squeeze a few drops on to the affected area and let it dry in.<br />You will notice when you use it that your skin appears to be tightening. Also with continued use the red marks on your face will lighten and eventually fade.<br />I had to stop using it. I believe it was working at first but after some continued use it was making things worse and the acne was spreading. I have a slightly oily skin type and this may not have been best suited to me.<br />Glad I tried it and I have a feeling that it may work better for a different skin type than mine.\"<br /><br />There you have it.

It goes in nicely, holds the hair back, doesn't slide out, and when it's taken out there is little to no hair caught in it.<br />However, I can't really see that the price for one is a great one. This is something you have to sort of weigh the options out though for yourself. I have noticed less hair pulling and loss with this hair thing, but the cost is up there.

When you are going to take it off remember to very gently remove it because it can become pretty sticky. It mentions this when you read about the product above but it is worth the reminder here!<br />These work very well and are a good option if you have problems often or occasionally with sweaty underarms.",

    "text": "I honestly don't even know WHERE to begin with this review 🤷🏻‍♀️<br /><br />I have, in my lifetime – and, wearing “fake” nails for OVER 25 YEARS – NEVER seen this type of … idea 🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />I'll be as short as possible with this …<br /><br />Most anyone who hasn't had an amputation, usually has 8 fingers and 2 thumbs – total of 10 “DIGITS” ✋🏻🤚🏻 And, in MOST cases – the nails are usually shaped the same.<br /><br />Thus, in a set of nails you'd need:<br /><br />💅🏻 2 – Thumb nails<br />💅🏻 2 – Index fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Middle fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Ring fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Pinkie fingernails<br /><br />I know – sounds almost silly or stupid to mention, but that's math. Total “NAILS” needed: 10 … (“Luxury 12pcs press on nails kit comes with 10 different sizes which is pre-numbered 0-9 in a box” … “choose the most suitable size that fits you every finger”). Hard to fit every finger when the nails are different sizes.<br /><br />And, we're NOT all sized the same. Hence why some packaging is no less than 24 nails with 12 sizes. I know because I've bought nails like this for YEARS! Just look up KISS and you'll see what I am talking about.<br /><br />This?<br /><br />Was this a joke? This is a set of TWELVE (12) nails – 10 different sizes! 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />Unlike the model hands – I don't wear my nails OVER the edges of my finger. That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with – and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being “fake”, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic. See how the salons do them, look on Google (or your favorite search engine).<br /><br />Who thought this was a great idea? And, these HAVE to be the LARGEST sizes for the particular “nails” I've seen. These really are a fancier version of the Lee and Wet N' Wild from the late 1980's/early 1990'.<br /><br />What's worse? Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I'll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep – they're pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I'd need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price – I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn't have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them. The seller might have a better set out there, but not this selection.",

It's worse when you have long legs, short arms.<br /><br />It's bad when you have certain chin hairs (thankfully not that much it isn't manageable another way).<br /><br />I tried some sugar wax kit back about 20+ years ago. That was a NIGHTMARE! It was supposedly edible. I think you microwaved the container, spread it on, let it cool, used a paper strip (supplied) to remove the hair. It didn't work and stung.<br /><br />I then moved to a hair removal cream, that partially worked.<br /><br />After that? Back to the hold stand-by –> shave foam/cream and a razor. For my main body parts, that's always worked. Tough “chin” hairs –> using a tweezer work. No, the dermaplaning tool didn't work on them.<br /><br />I got a wax warmer, so I thought all beads/beans were equal.<br /><br />These came with ZERO instructions, and the after spray bottle was busted. The warmer kit at least had some. And, my warmer kit had specially made, disposable “cups”.<br /><br />These beads/beans, in a smaller cup, took over 90 minute to melt. And, the warmer was on 180°(F).<br /><br />I tried a small amount on my arm. The wax was sticky, not liquidy, and it cooled almost as soon as it hit my skin.<br /><br />I let it sit there for a few minutes (over 5), and peeled the max off. It didn't hurt, sting, or cause redness – then again …<br /><br />THE HAIR WAS STILL THERE<br /><br />Okay, so my hair on my arm is a little thin. But, if this removes thick hair, shouldn't it remove thinner hair?<br /><br />I found another patch, got some warm wax – tried it again. Nope. Tried legs, arms, and under my chin. Nothing. Then again, I see I'm not the only one experiencing issues with these beads/beans.<br /><br />I may have gotten a bad batch. But, I definitely wouldn't get these again.",

Though I wouldn't carry a bar of soap, I have used “travel” size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway …<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don't intend to travel where I won't have soap. So, I'm using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me – it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don't really smell a “scent”, hands wash clean. They don't dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn't say these go years – if you're like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup – they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they're used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That's just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.",

Simple to use – plug in, turn on, heat up, section hair, and use – put hair in, count down.<br /><br />Works in theory, fails in execution. First up – there is NO heat seating guide for SAFE curling. THIS DEVICE IS CELSIUS (C) ONLY, NO FARENHEIT (F) OPTION. Google is strongly needed here.<br /><br />According to Redken: “For those with fine or thin hair, keep your iron set below 200 (so below 100°C on this device) degrees Fahrenheit. Any higher and your strands may burn. For those with coarse or thicker hair, have your curling iron set between 200 degrees and 300 degrees (148.9°C or on this device 150) Fahrenheit for optimal curls” [9 Curling Iron Secrets You Need to Know About/Redken]<br /><br />Using that, as well as Glamour's 8-10 second rule [How to Curl Your Hair Correctly: 7 Mistakes to Avoid – Glamour; “Drill it into your brain: You should hold an iron on your hair for eight to 10 seconds max”], along with using thinner groups of hair – I should have SOME wave. Nope. I even went 25 seconds. Nothing.<br /><br />As my hair has become a bit thinner, has been color treated, and exposed to SO much – I wasn't about to turn this up hotter.<br /><br />The curler is designed much like a crimper, but the “width” can make it difficult to handle, especially by yourself. There is a “guard” which heats up as well and it is easy to burn yourself.<br /><br />It wins with innovative idea as well as the digital temp gauge. Also, it does heat up SUPER fast, as well as cool down just as fast when lowering the temp.<br /><br />For use by myself – this is a two star deal.

The faux fur is soft and doesn't shed, and really adds to the unicorn aspect. The horns stand up from the headband, and are sparkly silver. The ears don't stand up as well, they're a bit floppy, and also have sparkly silver on the backs.<br /><br />The headbands are on the smaller side. I measured approximately 6 inches across the opening with a headband unstretched, and about 9 inches when fully stretched. I like that the headbands are tight, they stay on my head and hold my hair back. I don't have to keep fussing with them, they stay in place. They are about 2½ inches wide, which helps with comfort.",

The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place. I like it -- there's less chance of them popping off while I use the hair dryer.<br /><br />The bottom of the hair dryer says the rated power is 1800 watt, which is contrary to the description which says it is 2000 watt.",

I was out of stuff to wash and shave after about 3 min so the last 7 were pretty boring. In the future I will probably only wait 5 min.

Bath bombs come in a range of prices and quality, without a price it's hard to say if this is a good value. Kiddo loves bath bombs, but he values toys and water coloring over quality of skin softening or scent. So for this set he was not of any help. I tried one and found it to be nice but not as skin softening as some of the bigger ones I've tried. These are really more midline as the fizz is just average, scent was alright and not off putting but not amazing.<br /><br />If these are under $15 I'd say great value, above $20 and I'm not sure they are worth it, but not a terrible deal.",

At most it removed a top layer of dead skin making my skin feel softer (and dryer), but after rechecking my pores with a magnifying mirror (if you want to hate yourself buy one and then freak out at your skin, lol) there was no real difference. The before and after of my pores under the mirror were nearly identical.<br /><br />So all that work and annoyed skin for nothing.

These applicators are perfect to use with those.<br />Also, have you ever found that perfect shade of lipstick that you can't live without, only to find that it's been discontinued? These applicators help get every last bit of lipstick out of a tube so that you can enjoy it longer.<br />As you can see, the colors are pretty bright. I think that these would look more upscale in more muted colors, and if that's what you're going for, I would suggest getting the other color option in these. To be honest, what I would prefer, is if they were paper or wood instead of plastic. A little more environmentally friendly.<br />Still, they're good for what they are. The doe-foot tip Is slanted, just like with your favorite tubed liquid lip products. They are fuzzy, so they hold the lip product.<br />Makeup artists, as well as their clientele, will appreciate that these can be used once and then tossed. No spreading of germs and bacteria.",

The shape of the tube and the shape of the lipstick itself harkens to another era. Perfect for making the ultimate Cupid's bow pout. It even has that slight fragrance that will remind you of vintage lipsticks.<br /><br />I normally wear red that has a little more blue in it, so was surprised that this clear red was fine for me. To me that says that it will flatter a wide range of skin tones.<br />After swiping it on my wrist and then wiping it away, it left a nice stain. If you aren't interested in that drop dead gorgeous look and want something a little more subtle, it does double duty by leaving a pinky red stain when blotted. But go for the high voltage dramatic red if you want to be noticed.<br /><br />Very comfortable lipstick, but I didn't have a problem with it bleeding. Non-drying and non-cracking. Opaque coverage with one swipe.<br />Another plus, it makes your teeth look super white.<br />I hope that this review as well as the photographs can help you to make a decision about this lipstick. It's really hard buying such things online, especially when it comes to luxury brands like this.",

Suitable for any gender, and it's even a little stylish with an on-trend color as well as a very helpful strap. Now when I choose to take it off, I can have it hanging around my neck, ready to pull it back up if necessary. The ear loops are adjustable with a little bead that by now most of us are familiar with using.<br />It claims to be antimicrobial because of some copper content. It's also quick drying as well as offering UV protection.<br />Made in Korea.",

I'm thrilled to be in the percent that it did.<br />It has some of the same chemical components as Szechuan pepper, which has got to be safer than the botulism in Botox, right?<br /><br />Paracress is almost unheard of outside of Brazil. This will be our little secret!<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s. I've always taken care of my skin and stayed out of the sun, so I probably have fewer wrinkles than most people my age, but trust me, I've got them.<br /><br />Hopefully this review will help you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to make the rather substantial investments in this product. It's definitely a risk since it doesn't work for everyone. And I can't stress enough that it's not going to be super dramatic change. But heck, I'm excited at even small changes.<br /><br />xxoo",

It looks whipped in the jar, but it is not light on the face. I don't think it would be suitable for all ages. Because of the heaviness and intense moisturizing, I believe that mature skin is going to benefit most from using this.<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s, in a dry climate, with combination skin (T Zone) and some wrinkles as a point of concern.<br />This cream works very well with all of the above. I don't put it on my nose, of course, but when I feel like a splurge I put it on my hands because it's so moisturizing.<br />The claim that it moisturizes 24/7 is indeed true. Even in this dry area, my face feels hydrated all day when I use this cream.<br />It contains milk protein, yogurt extract, blueberry extract, rice protein, and a host of other skin-loving ingredients.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to invest in this product. It is indeed generously sized at 3.4 oz, and it has a very high quality ingredients. But like I said, it's not going to be for everyone.<br /><br />xxoo",

    "text": "Do you like champagne cocktails? This one smells like a combination of peach and champagne, and even looks like it!<br />It comes out like a gel. It's activated by water, so after washing your face, leave your face damp and put a thin layer of the gel quickly all over your face. Include your neck if you like.<br />Then with each passing moment, it's going to get foamier and foamier. That's why you have to have a very thin coat. You only need a small amount of product. If you use too much, your face is going to foam up like you have shaving cream all over!<br /><br />After about 5 or 10 minutes, you massage a little bit with warm water and then rinse. After you dry your face it's going to feel squeaky clean. If you have dry skin, you're ready for a moisturizing serum and cream. If you have oily or acne prone skin, use the appropriate products for that skin type. I don't feel that this mask is drying, but it does leave you very clean.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this is good for all skin types, as long as you use it as a brightening mask as opposed to a hydrating mask.<br />This is just what your skin needs if you have overdosed on hot humid weather.please look at the ingredients to see if you have any sort of allergy or if any of them are a trigger for any skin issues. Because I have sensitive skin that can be triggered, but I only left it on for about 4 minutes. I had absolutely no irritation, but I think if I had left it on longer, I might have. That doesn't mean it's bad for you. If you leave a mild castile soap, which is so gentle, on your face for any length of time, skin will be irritated.<br />Made in the USA, from Tonica Skin in Marblehead Massachusetts.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to try this fun mask. It really does leave your skin feeling and looking energized, but it's a bit of an investment. Nice splurge for a spa night, and because the product comes out via a pump, it's going to be sanitary for all the participants.<br />It's going to make for some really fun and Instagram worthy photos!<br /><br />xxoo<br /><br />PS, my 'spa night' pal doesn't look too impressed 😆",

After you remove it, put the top back on and separate the light unit from the jar.<br />The red LED light will be activated by pressing against your skin. Does that light actually do anything, or is it a gimmick?<br />There are a number of high-priced red light units on the market. They were first used in dermatologist offices and med spas. When they first came out, I had a red Tanda unit. This is exactly the same concept, and yes, you will have a slight difference.<br />The amount of cream gone in the jar has been for about 10 applications. I do it at night so I can relax while holding the unit at various places on my face. The red light goes on when you press slightly on the metal ring, as you can see in the photographs. As you press it to the area of your face that you want treated, slide it from the middle of your face outward, for 3 minutes. Then go to the next area. This way you get a little bit of a lymphatic massage. If you suffer with sinus headaches, this action is very good at offering some relief.<br /> The cream is very lightly fragranced with a fresh scent. It's a gel or mousse type of cream.<br />After purchasing this, you can get the cream refill.<br /><br />So much cheaper than buying an LED light device like a Tanda.",

Peacock feathers are not harvested from the animal, you simply pick them up as they are naturally shed.<br />This set arrived in a plastic bag. When I pulled the pieces out, there were three peacock feather pieces and one headband. Each feather piece has a rhinestone accent at the bottom. One is all rhinestone, one is a pearl surrounded by rhinestones, and one is a London blue stone surrounded by rhinestones.<br />Of the two larger pieces, one has an alligator clip hot glued onto the felt backing, and one has a strip of grossgrain ribbon glued to the back. Although I'm not sure, I suspect that it was at one time glued to the headband, or they leave it to the consumer to glue it to the headband. I tried to push the end of the headband through the middle of the ribbon, thinking that perhaps it could slide on, but it is glued completely, you can't slide it onto the headband.<br />The smaller piece also has an alligator type clip of the same size as the larger clipped piece. They stay beautifully in your hair and are actually comfortable.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this a glamor or fashion accessory set, it's definitely a costume set that would be great for a roaring twenties party. Each one would also be a fun addition to a hat. I wear a lot of hats and love to adorn them with scarves and feathers.<br /><br />The following is not part of my review but it is a kind of funny peacock story. naturally, when guests came over they wanted to see him with his tail spread out in beautiful peacock glory. They only open up like that when they're trying to impress someone, and he certainly was never impressed by any of my guests. At the time I also had a miniature pig. That peacock was so in love with the pig that whenever she came near him he would spread out his feathers and shake them hoping she would notice and return his love. Of course that never happened, the pig could care less. But whenever we wanted to show him off to our friends, we would walk the pig over to him and he would immediately open his tail feathers with a great flourish! My friends and I were all impressed. Maggie the pig was not.",

I took equal parts of this oil and emu oil, and rubbed it on my feet after dry buffing. Socks go on, and like me, you will wake up to soft, silky feet.<br /><br />Any oil can go rancid, so keep it in the fridge.<br /><br />Very pleased with the quality of this rosehip seed oil I was given to test.",

Day after day. What a time saver! It does a fantastic job. It delivers a better shave than my really high-$ screen shaver.<br /><br />6 heads is an improvement over 5. First, it simply covers more area. This is your head ---> a spheroid with protuberances. The 6-head shaver conforms to stuff like your ears and jawline better. 6-heads get the cutter closer to the nooks and crannies where those obnoxious thickets of long hairs might survive for a couple of days before someone points and say, \"Ewee!\"<br /><br />The shaver is small and easy to hold. A charge lasts more than a month. Cleaning is easy. I use shaving cream to lubricate, just like a regular razor. A 'dry' shave in the shower might sound like an oxymoron, but you'll know what I mean when you use it once.<br /><br />I'm sold. Adds at least 5-minutes of goof-off time in my morning routine. I'll take every minute I can gather. Perseverance might payoff with a straight razor shave, but the time saved here to goof off in the AM pays off immediately!<br /><br />It's revolutionary.<br /><br />Was my review helpful?

Generic replacement brushes aren't interchangeable between the two. The SOGUE has a smaller shaft. The brushes are also smaller.<br /><br />3. The SOGUE comes with like a year's supply of brushes, unlike the super mega-brand. They are just a tad softer than I prefer. It took me some years to technically discriminate my preferred bristle adjective (soft, medium, hard) for re-order. My brush changing rule is 'new brush for every recharge' as brushes are now so inexpensive. The charges on these toothbrushes have got to be the longest-lasting rechargeable device in the house. It seems like months go by on a charge.<br /><br />4. The SOGUE and brush are about a quarter smaller. It's a noticeable difference. After a minute of thought, I think smaller is likely better as your teeth and the spaces in between are much smaller than you think. Maybe it's getting in tighter corners.<br /><br />5. The SOGUE charges in like 2 hours vs. overnight for the super mega-brand.<br /><br />I was looking at the super mega-brand's newest models at the big-box store. The price is absurd given all the competition from suppliers like SOGUE. The latest super mega-brand models appear the same size as the SOGUE. At a third of the price and assuming the charge life is long, it's a no-brainer. I'll adapt. Most of the difference between the two is a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />SOGUE wins for now.

    "text": "This has an exceptionally refreshing fragranced with essential oils. Reading the ingredients, I was impressed that the ingredients have detoxifying qualities. It really showed in the experience of how it was to use the salts.<br /><br />Though the instructions said to use the entire bag, I was a little shocked by this because it's a lot of salt and also at the time of purchase, the product was listed at about $35, so it seemed way too luxurious to use the entire thing. However, I tend to agree with them that half the bag was not quite enough and when the bath was full, I couldn't really smell the fragrance anymore with just half the bag.<br /><br />That said, even with just half the bag, I could feel the detoxifying qualities and after the bath I rinsed off well in the shower to remove any of the toxins that had come out through my skin.<br /><br />The sharp, rough rose quartz gem that was included was a bit of a surprise. I would've expected that in a product that you're supposed to dump out into your bathtub, they would've chosen a smoother stone rather than a rough one. It had some serious sharp angles to it. I would definitely recommend fishing it out before dumping the bag in your bath so that you don't scratch your bathtub. It is beautiful, though.<br /><br />Overall if the price to you seems fair for a single bath, then I highly recommend this product. The quality level is great, it's just a matter of how much do you want to spend for a single bath.",

    "text": "Desktop Pro 2019 upgraded smoothly and easily with absolutely no issues. I began by backing up my QuickBooks desktop Pro 2018, and then began the installation process. It went smoothly and quickly and didn't take very long. I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br /><br />The part that was awful was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things. Luckily I was aware of this so when simply entering the information into QuickBooks didn't work, I knew that I was in for a phone call. About 45 minutes later of being on hold and trying to be up sold on QuickBooks online by an Indian tech-support person (hey guys, I just got desktop Pro 2019 upgraded, please don't sell me on QuickBooks online), I was good to go.<br /><br />I think it's absolutely offensive that after you've purchased a software product like this they make you call in as a matter of course to activate. Anybody using this product is either being paid by the hour or runs a business and does not have that kind of spare time to sit around wasting on a process that should be 30 seconds of data entry.<br /><br />I have multiple employees and so end up paying an additional 4 to 8 dollars per month for the subscription to add additional employees. It's another two dollars a month per employee after the first one. Also, be aware that the setting is set to subscribe you to an annual payroll subscription, which if done through QuickBooks will cost you about $420. Purchasing the new upgrade of desktop Pro 2019 with the payroll for a year costs less than that, so being automatically billed such a high amount for just the payroll is offensive and ridiculous.<br /><br />I would really like QuickBooks as a company to reconsider how they deal with their payroll subscriptions and activation of payroll that has already been purchased, because this is a huge problem that is been garnering them poor reviews and lots of bad press for some time. I personally have considered many times changing to a more congenial company just to avoid this particular dance every single year. Do I pay $420 to avoid being on the phone for 45 minutes with somebody from India who act like I've done something terribly wrong by purchasing my payroll upgrade on Amazon along with the software upgrade? Or do I do as I have done most years and purchase the yearly upgrade that comes with the enhanced payroll.<br /><br />As an FYI, the enhanced payroll really does make it very easy to run your quarterly reports and do your e-filing. I did it myself for many years, but now hand the file back and forth to my bookkeeper via email as a portable file.",

Between that and all of the diaper wipes I use, my hands have been starting to peel and crack, so I knew I needed a solution.<br /><br />This argan oil came with a regular lid, an eyedropper, and a pump dispenser. I used the pump dispenser and set it right next to my faucet so I could get a quick pump of oil every time I wash my hands. Well, it only took a couple of days to experience really great results. My hands feel normal again, and I am so relieved. From hard skin that was rough and crackled, to soft, happy hands again.<br /><br />I have also used the product on my split ends, and here, I'd like to caution you that only a few drops are needed.

It comes packaged beautifully and looks like a gift, has multiple options for how you dispense it, and is pure, organic, and has the mild scent of real argan oil, unlike some competitors.",

Unless you have very light blonde hair, this is only going to provide grayish highlights. That is even taking into account the fact that I was quite generous with this cream. This is the first time I've tried a product like this, so I'm not sure how the other brands do, but this was just OK for me. I wouldn't recommend using this for anything other than some colorful highlights on short hair, maybe not in a color that contrasts too much.",

    "text": "This is a fun easy mask to use. I put it on after a harsher exfoliation for a little TLC. It goes on easily, just pump it out and spread it on thinly over your face. Make sure your face is damp so it has something to activate. It starts bubbling quickly and tickles a little and then a lot! The big clumps of bubbles will pop and flatten on your face and when most of them were popped I wet my hands and rubbed the mask on my face. After rinsing with a washcloth my face felt good and looked brighter. It had a little hydration to it, which was a bonus. It does have a heavy floral/musk scent so if you are sensitive to smells this might not be for you.",

There aren't any instructions other than to clear the tube in case it gets stuck. It says it's a continuous spray and through a brief trial and error I discovered you pump the handle to prime the spraying mechanism and that makes it basically a continuous spray. The pump is really easy to operate, you can easily squeeze it with one finger. When you put the top back on you have to push it down and then it's just like a half or quarter turn to keep it on. One of the questions was would I take it when I travel and it's a little too bulky to bring it with on all trips. If I think I would need it or have tons of room in my suitcase maybe.",

The packets also said to not use if you are breastfeeding or pregnant so that was concerning - not sure what is in it or how it effects milk, but i still pump for my daughter. I kept these securely on my feet for the directed amount of time and then took them off and took a shower. A couple days later my right foot started to peel first but got really itchy so i think i scratched off some of the peeling skin. The description says it will peel in about a week and leave skin smooth but my whole foot didnt peel and I still have patches of dried skin and calluses. Idk if I was suppose to keep socks/ slippers off  during this time but it didnt completely work for me for whatever reason. Maybe if they provided a more detailed instruction process I couldve been more successful?",

The way it opens leaves my hand too close to the heat which results in easily getting burned. Which isn't a problem if you wear the glove... but being honest, I'm not going to use a heat shield glove every day to do my hair. I only use one of these **sometimes** when I am using a curling wand. So for me that is a huge con. It also comes with two hair clips to help separate the sections of your hair. For the price... Its a great wand. You will get used to where you need to hold your hand.",

I love a more lightweight moisturizer that doesn't look greasy and this fits the bill.  It absorbs completely and makes your skin feel hydrated and plump.  I wear a lot of foundation and it goes over this moisturizer nicely without causing any weird texture or breakage.  Unfortunately with the cold weather now upon us, it still isn't quite enough to keep my skin hydrated all day and I do start to feel tight after a few hours.  For me, this will be great in the warmer months but I just need a little bit more out of a cream in the winter.  I think it is a great moisturizer for most people, just maybe not enough for those of us with desert dry skin.",

This has two buttons that control the temperature up or down and it has a little window to show what the current temp is. The maximum temperature is 350 and it reaches that rather quickly. It has a switch that controls the speed of the twirl low or fast. Then there is a button to control the direction you want to curl your hair left or right and it has a home button to return the iron to the correct home position. This has a flipper that is about an inch to start your twirl but it leaves crease marks in your hair that cannot be corrected unless you re-wet it and start all over. It really needed a heat resistant glove because no matter how skilled you are at this you are going to try and wrap your hair with your hand so it is a high probability of user error which will probably result in a burn. This is a really nice gray and white. I do like this curling iron it just has a few hiccups.",

I think the part I love the most about it is the fact that the cut and style are foolproof-not a lot of styling on this wig to get the result.  Even for a synthetic wig, it is so natural looking, and the cap fits to the scalp nicely.  This wig is my new go to wig for everyday wear.  I have received so many compliments and I am so pleased with the results!",

The charcoal powder is put on a wet toothbrush and then you brush.....and the taste is disgusting.  The black spew dirtied the sink, and required me scrubbing it after each use.  As for the whitening properties, I could see no difference with the exception of the fact after scrubbing my teeth with this noxious powder, I had to brush my teeth with my toothpaste 3 separate times to get rid of the black mess.  I was really disappointed in this product, and couldn't give a recommendation for this.  It was simply disgusting.",
