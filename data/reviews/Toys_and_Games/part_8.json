Once completed it is a lovely puzzle. I decided to mod podge it and frame it.<br /><br />The loss of one star is because several of the pieces were not cut clearly and had paper bits that needed removed. That's my only complaint on this puzzle, but it was several pieces I had to carefully remove the excess paper bits from in order for the pieces to all fit like they're suppose to.

NOT a vendor issue it was a compatibility issue because I wanted \"bearing\" swing hangers and NOT plastic washer types<br />This will work great for our next child and it's getting lots of use in our neighborhood<br />Fast delivery and great product from this vendor!!!",

    "title": "Extremely Strong Swing Set Bracket",
    "text": "This is an Amazon product and it is a super product! It is well made and solid. All the hardware is in the box. If your working on a swing set then you should have the few basic tools needed; a drill for pilot holes for the 3 inch lag bolts; wrench or socket for the lag bolts (9/16 inch socket or wrench). Assembly requires two 4x4x8 treated boards for the legs. And, one 4x6x12 (for three swing set)<br />Here's the glitch for easy installation. We went to a box store and bought a true cut 4x6x12 treated beam. But, the bracket section for this 4x6x12 beam is true to size and will not fit a treated  4x6 beam because treated wood is actually slightly bigger; about 1/4 inch on all sides. You have to shave about 1/4 inch x 10 inches off one side of the 4x6 beam and 1/4 inch off the top or bottom of  the beam as well. Then this brace will slide in without banging the beam or bracket. Do NOT bang the bracket! We used spray cooking oil after we shaved it on the beam and bracket and it slid in perfect. If you look closely at the photos you can see we shaved the 4x6 beam to fit<br />There is NOTHING wrong with this bracket! It is designed to fit a 4x6 size beam BUT treated wood is still sold as a 4x6 product but it is slightly thicker<br />Regardless, trim it a little like mentioned and it will work great and be extremely secure and strong!<br />I would buy it again without hesitation!!!",

I have to agree with another reviewer that the picture of the puzzle is TINY on the side of the box.  The picture on the box cover is just a part of the picture.  Many M & D puzzles do that.  Older ones used to enclose a picture of the puzzle - kind of like a poster.  I wish they still did that.  One other small comment with this puzzle that I haven't experienced with other M & D puzzles is that 2 of the pieces of the interior puzzles have flat sides like an edge piece typically would.  Makes it a little tricky if you typically work from the outside in - but like I said we were looking for a little more difficult puzzle.",

I bought it early before he came for a visit from Germany. By the time he got here and tried it out, it had been over just over 30 days. That meant I couldn't return it.

Usually even the things I buy that have crappy, nominal, barely-English instructions are pretty easy to figure out. There are modes and levels and timers yet only 3 buttons with no clearly defined labels (on the unit or in the instructions) on how to use. So to YouTube I went and had to watch a super annoying guy with a weird full-face mask and weirder 'just had my eyes dilated' sunglasses ramble his way through badly giving enough info on how to use that I could demonstrate the toy to my kid.<br /><br />That said, the little arms are progressively harder to knock back and register points on... which I get why... but even with my kid's  \"SHEESHAFREAKINGMIGHTY THAT HURTS LIKE A MUTHA...\" strong shooter, at close range, it is difficult to knock back the 50 and 75 point arms. It took a LOT of cheating on my part over multiple multiple rounds to sort of decrease the resistance enough that he could actually do it himself (he has fine motor weakness in one hand and doesn't have the cognitive ability to figure out how to use a sight to improve his aim).<br /><br />Overall a 3.5 to 4 for us.",

It rumbles and grumbles just like a tractor sound and  tractor vibrates for a several seconds. A bit more vibrating than a cell phone, so would likely vibrate off of a table/chair.<br />He didn't want to open anything else on Christmas. He would go through the room putting it on our laps and pressing rumble, we acted surprised, he laughed and moved to the next person. So adorable!<br /><br />*I asked his Mom if I could get it for him, and I know that he will always be supervised when using it. I would not recommend a toddler play unsupervised with this, there are little parts that can easily break off and has batteries, all things tikes would be putting in their mouth.<br />This is super cute, but the arms on the front end, and parts in the cabin dont look like they are sturdy enough to outlast the 2 yo.<br /><br />I searched for \"Tonka\" specifically remembering how tough and rugged they were for my three sons, who gave them to their sons 20+ years later.

Don't get me wrong-this is super cool but it should include more discs as it only came with 2-and I could see how this may eventually need a repair-just seems very \"plasticy\".  Love that it came w/ adapter and overall really great idea-can't wait until the kids open for x-mas-camp-outs in the living room!!!!",

I want to let people know about her achievements and the arrival of her graduation day so I decided to get this 2023 Graduation Porch Banner<br /><br />You get two banners with this set. The banners are six feet tall and one foot wide. One has Congrats written large, the other has Graduate written large. The year 2023 isn't indicate on the banners, and that is good because it means you can use them again, for other graduation celebrations.<br /><br />The material these banners is made from feels like the material on most flags. It is designed not to wrinkle, and it is tear resistant. It comes ready to hang, with a crossbar on the top and extended string. All you need is something to hook the string on. A nail or something similar is ideal, but lots of things will work. It's light enough that you could tape it, if necessary. And it can be displayed indoors or outdoors.<br /><br />You only graduate high school once. I like bragging a little about my daughter and her achievements and this set of banners helps me do just that. I have them indoors now, but as the big day draws closer, I am going to place them outside, one on each side of the front door, for all to see.",

Graduations mean celebrations and a good way to make sure you have the decorations you need is to purchase a multi- pack like this one, from Officygent.<br /><br />Inside this package is an assortment of celebratory items, just waiting to be displayed. The large banner, which says We Are So Proud Of You, is just right for this type of occasion and it was the main reason I got this package in the first place. But there is much more to like than just the banner. The black and gold balloons look cool and the large 2022 foil balloons really make a statement. They are almost three feet tall, so every party guest will see them.<br /><br />You will need to blow up the assorted balloons that come with this set. They are not that big, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Even the foil 2022, while tall, to not hold a large amount of volume. With the other items, like the banner and paper fans, they are ready to display in no time. The quality of the items is top- notch and the colors speak elegance.<br /><br />Graduation happens only once per year. To do things right, you need props and this package from Officygnet has what you need to get the party started. Everything looks good and adding this display items at your graduation celebration is certain to create many lasting memories.",

    "text": "Having an inground pool means constantly looking for ways to enhance the experience. We don't do much actual swimming in our pool. We mainly hang out and float, so having pool floats is a necessity. A recent addition to our backyard recreation was this inflatable Mermaid Pool Float from Parentswell.<br /><br />Pulling this float from the package and unfolding it, you can see that it's going to be larger than most, and it is. The lengthy tail is the reason. Inflating it will require a powerful set of lungs, since it is larger than average. I didn't have a suitable pump for mine, so I did have to inflate the old- fashioned way. It took time, but I got there.<br /><br />Once inflated, it was ready to test in the pool. The opening in the middle is narrow enough that you can either lie on top of the float without worry that you will fall through. Or, you can stick your body through the center and wear the float, as you drift around in your pool. It works as well as any and the mermaid design is certainly cute. In fact, I would say that the cuteness factor is possibly it's strongest point. It will be a huge hit with anyone who love mermaids.<br /><br />Pools are better when you have things to enhance the experience. This float from Parentswell is a good one overall. It can take time to inflate but once ready, it holds its own and it does look cute inside my inground pool.",

Just flip open the box and start handing it out. The containers are easy enough to open and kids can get slimy immediately.<br /><br />This slime is a little on the wet side- more so than other slime and it's also a little on the thin side, which means it tends to slip easily from your hands. The colors are cool and the moment you start to share, and others become aware of the pretty colors and fun waiting to be had, they won't be able to keep their hands off it.<br /><br />Slime is a fun toy for most any kid and this package of Unicorn slime is a good one to consider for your next kiddie activity. It can be squished and rolled around in the hands for stress relief and for endless giggles, making it perfect for a kids' gathering.",

Puzzles are good for lots of reasons and that's why I like and recommend this six pack of wooden puzzles from DuLaSeed.<br /><br />Made from wood, this pack of puzzles includes six different, fun shapes. There is a car, plane, and ship along with a bear, bee, and owl. Each puzzle has only a handful of pieces and each is assembled on a flat base. The base already has the outline of the transportation or animal, which helps make it easier for toddlers to figure out which piece goes where.<br /><br />Each of these six puzzles is brightly colored, and that means children will be naturally drawn to them and want to play. The puzzles are simple enough to complete and they give youngsters a feeling of accomplishment when finished. The other cool thing is that the pieces are large enough that they shouldn't pose a choking hazard. And when finished, just return the puzzles to the included bag. You will need this bag because it will otherwise be very easy to lose pieces.<br /><br />Kids benefit most from toys that are both fun and educational. This six piece puzzle set helps kids develop find motor skills and the bright colors and simple fun will keep kids entertained. It's made from wood, too, so it's durable. It's a great gift choice for toddlers between the ages of one and three.",

If you have a youngster in the roughly two- to four-year-old age group, a good toy option is this 5 in 1 Activity Cube from SYLDD&TH.<br /><br />Made from wood, this cube shaped toy has different activities on four of its sides, and on top. There are things to move around with the hands and it helps kids with their fine motor skills, coordination, and problem solving. There are just a few loose pieces. To help make sure you don't lose them, the top lifts off and can then be turned upside down and placed into the open end, to seal it shut.<br /><br />Young people will enjoy moving the different parts on this toy with their tiny hands and parents will like watching and coaching their kids to success. The toy is somewhat small overall- only about six inches on a side- and it is therefore intended for young people with small fingers. Older toddlers might be too big for this toy, so keep that in mind. On the positive side, it is made from wood and seems more durable than many other toys on the market.<br /><br />Educational toys are among the best for young children. This toy from SYLDD&TH is a very good choice for the toddler in your life. It will help them improve skills and coordination and most kids will have a lot of fun moving the different pieces around and feeling a sense of achievement.",

This set also includes markers, plain white sheets, design sheets that already have scenes on them, and even frames to display the young artist's works. The markers don't seem like they are made to last, but they should last long enough to keep kids entertained and you can always replace them with your own set of markers, if necessary.<br /><br />This toy is based on a popular kids television show, so fans of the show will enjoy it even more. I was not even aware that this was a show- I got the set because it looked like fun and I knew it encouraged creativity. Don't worry if your recipient isn't familiar with the cartoon. Most any kid will find this is a fun toy and they will continue to come back to it, again and again.<br /><br />Creative toys are among the very best.

The strap is adjustable, too, and the buckles are detachable, if you would rather use the purse that way.<br /><br />The push buttons on this fidget purse make a soft popping sound as you press them, and like with other fidget toys, this can be useful for stress relief.

The popping sound is barely audible with this toy, which I think is better than other fidget toys.<br /><br />Fidget toys are great for curbing anxiety.

What aspiring princess wouldn't want to sit at a vanity table, try on play makeup, brush hair, and admire herself in the mirror? It's all good fun, but I do have some issues with this vanity set. For one, it doesn't seem very durable and not as likely to last as others. For another, it doesn't seem like the type of toy that will hold a kid's interest for long. If you introduce more things to it, more accessories for example, that will make a difference. Otherwise, it's likely to get old in a short time.<br /><br />Still, despite its questionable durability and other qualities, the Light Up princess Vanity Table is the type of toy that most preschoolers will love. It encourages imaginative play and it is less expensive than many of the more heavy- duty vanity/beauty toys.

It has six animal shapes for interactive play and the bus is driven by two cute animals that sway back and forth while the bus moves and the tunes play. The colorful look, the sounds, and the actions will appeal to any youngster.<br /><br />The music and the sounds of animals that you hear when you push the right shape through the opening are great for kids, but this bus is more about learning than anything. Kids will be challenged to fit the right animal through the matching opening. They can also learn to count using the beads and the interconnected wheels on the back turn together, like gears.<br /><br />Fitting the animals through the openings can be a challenge for kids, depending on their age, but most kids will be able to figure it out. You may need to coach and encourage your young one, but they will eventually learn how to fit the animals through the openings. Even if they can't at first, they will love the sounds and other features of this colorful bus.<br /><br />It's great when toys can also serve as a learning tool.

But there is a better option, and it's a fidget toy. Having more than one is even better and that is why you might want this Push Fidget Sensory 4 Pack.<br /><br />You get an orange heart, yellow heart, purple octagon, and green octagon with this set. The pieces are larger than some other fidget toys and the buttons are a little larger, too, making this a good option for older and younger people. The way it works is simple: Just push the buttons in, listen to them pop, then turn it over and push them the opposite way.<br /><br />This might sound too simplistic to be any fun, but those who have used these fidget toys will tell you that they do achieve their stated purpose. You do feel a sense of stress relief as you press. It's similar to popping the bubbles on bubble wrap, but the nice thing is that, with a fidget toy like this, you can use it again and again.<br /><br />We have lots of these fidget toys in my household and this set is just as good if not better than most of the others. The large buttons are nice and since you get a set of four, you have enough to give them to other family members. It's a great remedy for restless fingers and a toy recommended to all.",

The paint is waterproof and you don't need to worry about stains, as it wipes up quickly and easily. The containers of paint are small, but there should be enough to last all the way through the painting of each rock. Just make sure to spread out the use of the different colors and there shouldn't be an issue with the paint supply.<br /><br />Crafts are fun and beneficial for kids. This Rock Painting kit is a great means to hours of fun. It has everything kids need to get their creativity going, all in a single package.",

    "text": "If you're anything like me, it has likely been a long time since you played with a yo-yo. Many kids don't even know what they are. If you want to introduce your kids to this classic toy, you might consider this set of yo-yos from Giggle Time.<br /><br />This kit contains a total of 12 yo- yos, which makes it great for handing out to a large number of kids as part of a gift package, fun bag, etc. I was a little disappointed that several of the yo- yo's in my package had come un- stuck from the backing. Since the plan was to hand out some of them to different kids, I had to tape them to the cardboard backing. It made for better presentation.<br /><br />As for the yo-yos, they glow, which is cool. They are a little less sturdy than expected, however, and the plastic casing isn't as durable as the wooden yo-yos from my youth. Still, they seem okay and should provide a good deal of fun for kids. Yo-yos are good for improving coordination and with a pack of 12, you have all that you need to get a kids' party started.<br /><br />Yo-yos are not as commonplace as they once were, but they are a classic toy that more kids should get to know and experience. This set from Giggle Time has its issues, but it is still a good option for those parents who want an item to add to goody bags and who want to encourage kids to do something other than stare at a computer or television screen for entertainment.",

    "text": "Little ones love to have dolls and their faces often light up when they have a doll that does things that make it like a real baby. A doll that can perform actions of some sort is best and that is what you get with Lissi 16\" Talking Baby Doll with Accessories.<br /><br />Out of the package, this doll has a carrier, feeding dish, fork spoon, bottle, etc. There are pjs, too. Press the doll's belly, and you will hear assorted statements such as ha ha, hello, etc. The sounds are what most kids will like best, but the added accessories can also be fun and being able to carry the doll around in its own baby carrier will make little ones feel like grown- ups.<br /><br />This doll seems like it would be as good as any other doll that makes sounds and takes a bottle. But there are issues and the first one I notice is with the sounds. There are six different sayings, but they are hard to hear and the sounds certainly don't sound like the voice of a baby girl! I couldn't even tell what some of the sayings were. I had to look online to find out what the doll is trying to say.<br /><br />Other issues are the bottle and pacifier. They do not fit into the baby's mouth and apparently are more for make- believe play than anything. The child I got this for is only two years old, so hopefully, she will not notice or care. Still, it makes me wonder why the manufacturer didn't work a little harder to get these things right.<br /><br />Most any young child likes dolls and those that make sounds are often popular. This Talking Baby Doll from Lissi is acceptable enough, I suppose. As long as expectations are kept to a minimum, it should be okay.",

Simple fun is often all it takes, but it's best to at least find something that helps encourage thinking, improves coordination, enhances creativity, etc. A simple toy that does the trick for young people is Unicorn Stickers for Kids - Make A Unicorn Stickers by Mocossmy.<br /><br />I got these stickers for my wife- she presently teaches kindergarteners and is always in need of something to fill the time each day for creative play. She looked at these stickers and felt they would be a good choice. They are cute and since kids often like to imagine things like unicorns, she knew these stickers would be a hit with the youngsters.<br /><br />Her intuition was correct, as her kiddos took an instant liking to these unicorn stickers. But what is even better is that they encourage kids to be creative and the reason is because kids get to create the unicorn using additional small stickers to add eyes, crowns, and other assortments. Usually, unicorn stickers are nothing more than a pre- designed unicorn waiting to be peeled and stuck. But here, kids are given a blank slate and then allowed to decorate the unicorn any way they like. That makes these stickers a notch better than others.<br /><br />Young people need time to play and exercise their developing brains. Unicorn Stickers for Kids - Make A Unicorn Stickers by Mocossmy are more than ordinary stickers. They are like creating a work of art without the mess and they are an easy winner in my wife's eyes and in the eyes of her kindergarteners.",

But there are other, better, less expensive options out there and one of them is Chalk World Jumbo Sidewalk Chalk Sets For Kids.<br /><br />Packaged in a plastic container with a pail- like handle, this chalk set includes twenty large pieces of chalk and 7 different colors. The large pieces are difficult to break and should hold up to hours of use. The chalk is non- toxic and easy to wash off the sidewalk when the time comes.<br /><br />Most kids will use this chalk on the sidewalk, but it can be used on other surfaces, too. It works on wood, bricks, and asphalt black top and because of the contrast, asphalt is probably the best surface of all. If your using this with your kids at home, your driveway is the place it will most likely get used and for most of us, that means concrete. The chalk works fine on concrete and with each piece measuring 4 inches in length and 1 inch in width, it is made to last for a while.<br /><br />It's fun to let kids be kids and show their creative side. Chalk World Jumbo Sidewalk Chalk Sets For Kids is great for this purpose. Just hand the container to your young ones, send them outdoors, and supervise as they create all sorts of works of art on a concrete or other surface. It's a fun product and one that most ant kid is bound to enjoy.",

MY GIF Moving Collectibles Toy with 6 Exclusive Dancing GIFbits.<br /><br />This set includes six different GIF and to make things more fun, each one features movements of some sort. You activate the movements by pushing or moving different sections of the item. It works a little different from one to the next. With the dog, there is a wind- up on its back and it will therefore continue to move on its own. With the others, you have to activate manually.<br /><br />Each of the six GIF in this set feature cool, vivid colors and they are cute to look at. The issues I can see are with specific pieces. The donut, for example, doesn't have a base and is therefore a little more of a problem to stand up, since it falls down easily. And the different GIF are inconsistent in what you have to do to make them move. No biggie, just something to keep in mind. For added fun, there is an app you can download, scan included cards, and have the different GIF on your phone.<br /><br />This is a fun enough set of GIF and if I could change one thing, it would be to have a wind- up on all six of them, and not just the dog, because then you could wind them all up and let them dance the night away. Other than this, the GF Moving Collectibles is a still a fun set for kids and adults alike.",

Most all of them do, and they especially love anything with bright colors, movement, lights, etc. A fun craft that elementary age girls will find to their liking is B Me Make Your Own Fairy Lantern Night Lights<br /><br />From the box, kids and parents will find that these kits contain everything they need to create their craft, except for the batteries. There are three plastic jars in the package, complete with lights, flowers, ribbons, string, glitter, etc, along with paint brushes and glue. There is a step by step set of instructions that explains exactly what to do.<br /><br />Putting these fairy lights together is great fun for youngsters. I like that they included three jars per package because that means your young person can have fun three separate times or, if you have more kids, up to three of them can create a jar of their own from a single package. Considering you have everything you need- except the batteries- to build three night lights, the price is more than fair. And since many kids want/need a night light anyway, this craft also serves a practical purpose.<br /><br />Assembling these night lights doesn't take too much time. It really depends on the amount of decorating your child intends to do. Once the handiwork is in place, it is just a matter of snapping the AAA batteries into the case, screwing it shut, and displaying the masterpiece. The finished product is cute and some parents might even choose to add one to their own bedroom. Your child will love this, especially knowing that they created something so cool that mom and dad want to put it on display in their bedroom.<br /><br />Kids love crafts and B Me Make Your Own Fairy Lantern Night Lights are a craft your kids are all but sure to enjoy.

It comes with a remote control and you have to load batteries into both the vehicle and the remote control before you can use it.<br /><br />With the remote control in hand, the Fortnite Baller Vehicle is ready for action. The remote has two knobs on it, similar to the controller for home video games. Kids can move each knob and control the movement of the vehicle. I discovered, too, that there is an adjustment level underneath that you can use if the vehicle isn't moving the way you want it to. And since the inside accommodates Fortnite figures, kids can feel free to swap out the one that comes with this toy with another one from the set.<br /><br />Fortnite fans have any number of toys they can buy that feature their favorite Fortnite characters, but the Fortnite Baller Vehicle is one of the cooler ones available.  The remote-controlled movement sets this toy apart and it's a great choice for fans of these action figures.",

You could place them back into the box, but the storage bag is better. It's cool that the manufacturer thought to add this because it's practical and better ensures that pieces don't get lost.<br /><br />Teaching problem- solving skills to young people can be accomplished in many ways and a toy like the Wooden Jigsaw Puzzle set from Lemostaar is useful for this purpose.

This is why I was more than happy to introduce my kids to<br />Snap Pop Beads for Kids, a product from Spartan Production.<br /><br />The first thing you notice with this toy/craft is the number of beads. There are more than 550 in the package and because there are so many and they are so small, it is easy to lose them over time. Fortunately, the plastic package serves as a storage place and it comes with organizing compartments to keep things separate.<br /><br />This is a jewelry making kit and youngsters will have fun taking the small beads and inserting them into other pieces which are then threaded through bracelets and other items to create creative jewelry. Kids can be as imaginative as they like and since there are so many pieces and so many unique ways to snap and combine them, there is truly a limitless number of combinations.<br /><br />The age limit on this toy is three years of age and it most certainly should not be given to any child younger than that, due to the small pieces. My kids are several years beyond age 3, but even if they were younger- say, 5 years old- I am not so sure I would give them a toy like this. I think it is best for upper- grade school age children. And while it is primarily for girls, there is no reason boys can't enjoy it, too.<br /><br />Toys that require creating and building are among my girls favorites. Young people are almost sure to link Snap Pop Beads for Kids because it lets them create their own jewelry any way they like. Just be sure to clean up after each use so that the small pieces aren't lost and you and your kids will be all set for many episodes of fun and play.",

    "text": "Kids who like to assemble things have a multitude of toy options. There are some that take considerable time and effort to put together, but there are others that are less time- consuming. One example of the latter is Smashers Dino Ice Age Mini Surprise Egg.<br /><br />With this toy, you get an egg- shaped container that includes a Smasher creature to put together, slime packets, and stickers. The egg is larger than I expected and one thing I like is the protruding claw- not only does it look cool, but it lets you know which creature is inside. This is great for those who want to collect all six of these and would prefer not to have it be a guessing game.<br /><br />As I said, it doesn't take much time to assemble this together, which is good. Once assembled, it's time to let the creative fun begin with the stickers and the crystal slime and other compounds. Kids will have their own unique way to create situations and decorate with the stickers. It's even more fun to have at least two of these and with such a reasonable price point, getting a pair is a good way to start.<br /><br />If your kids like prehistoric age animals and Smashers in general, then they will like Smashers Dino Ice Age Mini Surprise Egg. Just smash the egg open, assemble, add some slime, and have some frigid fun!",

    "text": "Kids love to color. Traditional crayons easily do the trick, but there is an alternative that some kids and parents might like better, and that alternative is BIC Kids Crayons Assorted Colors.<br /><br />Each package of these crayons contains 24 different colors. This is a nice assortment and it should keep kids satisfied and occupied for a long time. Whatever they want to color, there should be a shade to match what they need.<br /><br />The most unusual feature of these crayons is the length. They are longer than the typical crayon and that can be both good and bad, I suppose. There is no paper to peel, which is different from what I am used to and, in many respects, better than other crayons. The long length is good, but it also means they can break easily and they are a little much for the very young. With older kids, however, they will work fine and older kids will actually prefer them to regular crayons.<br /><br />BIC is mostly known for its pens, but these crayons are a nice way to see the product line expand. You get 24 crayons per pack and three packages total, so you can hand a pack to each of three kids. They last longer than other crayons and make a good choice for young, budding artists everywhere.",

If your kids love Roblox like so many do, then a good toy option is Roblox Action Collection - Meme Pack Playset.<br /><br />With this mix and match set, kids can create their own Roblox character situations. There are about 25 pieces in the package and it even comes complete with a special code you can use for a virtual item. You get a set of classic Roblox characters plus you can throw in accessories for added fun. The block- like characters look just like they do on the screen and young fans will have a blast playing with actual, physical characters they have grown to love in the virtual world.<br /><br />Any kid who loves Roblox will love this set, but there are a few issues that some parents may have. One obvious one is that there are several small pieces, which makes them easy to lose. I recommend finding a plastic, resealable bin in which to store the set. And since there are small pieces, it is best not to give this to a young child. It is intended more for older elementary school age kids.<br /><br />Roblox has its share of fans and the Roblox Action Collection - Meme Pack Playset is certain to make any Roblox fan fall in love. What could be better than having these characters you have grown to love on a screen suddenly show up in a package, in physical form? It's bound to make Roblox fans everywhere as pleased as punch and it makes this toy a great gift for young fanatics.",

    "text": "Kids need time to take a break from schoolwork. But often, the breaks they take involve television or smart phones. There are lots of great non- electronic alternatives and one of them is the BEARUN 3D Coloring Puzzle Set.<br /><br />This set is a combination puzzle and coloring activity. Kids start by coloring one of the puzzles' pieces. The set includes a house, windmill, dinosaur, etc. and the pieces are on a rectangular board. Kids color them, then the pieces need to be punched out of the board for assembly.<br /><br />To help with the coloring, this kit comes complete with a set of 12 markers and they are dual- tipped. One side is a fine tipped marker designed for drawing thin lines while the other side is a brush tip designed for making wider lines. Kids are free to color whatever way they like, using the 12 vibrant colors. The more artistic kids will have fun alternating colors into an artful design while other creative kids will add their own individual flair.<br /><br />Once kids finish coloring, the pieces are punched from the board and the items is then assembled. This is a large part of the fun and it helps kids improve their motor skills. When the items are assembled, kids can then display their work of art on a desktop or other flat surface, for all to see. It takes some effort to assemble, and some younger kids might need assistance. Otherwise, the assembly of the puzzle is a big part of the fun.<br /><br />Kids need to take breaks and what better way to enjoy free time then by creating something fun? BEARUN 3D Coloring Puzzle Kit is two activities in one and kids will love both the coloring and assembling aspects of this educational and artistic activity. I can't really find anything to criticize and it thus earns my highest recommendation.",

    "text": "I have an in-ground pool and I'm always looking for ways to enhance the family pool time experience with added accessories. There are some fancy floats that have made their way into my pool, but I've also had simpler floats that are good in their own way and a good example of the latter is Aqua 18- pocket inflatable contour lounger.<br /><br />This oblong float is intended to hold one individual. It measures about 6 feet in length so if you're very much taller than average, your feet are going to hang over the edge. The float has an inflatable pillow so you can get some much-needed head support while you rest.<br /><br />I have other loungers like this one, but what sets the Aqua 18- pocket inflatable contour lounger apart from my others is the pockets. These are open spaces, spaced out along the body of the float, that allow the water to touch your body. Some may not like this idea at first, but it is quite nice because it keeps you from getting too hot. With other floats, your entire body is exposed to the sun and if the heat is extreme, you will likely only be able to last a short time before having to jump completely into the water to cool off. With this float, the pool water is always touching parts of your skin, helping to keep you cool.<br /><br />It takes only a short time to inflate this lounger. It can hold up to 250 pounds and it keeps you comfortably suspended above the water. With the headrest, you can kick back and float in total comfort. It's very easy, as you might guess, to fall asleep on this lounger so keep that in mind before you climb aboard.<br /><br />Accessories make swimming better and an assortment of different floats is essential for any pool owner. Aqua 18- pocket inflatable contour lounger is a very nice accessory for my pool and one that my family has quickly taken a liking to. The open pockets help keep you cool and it's a great way to relax on a sunny day.",

The good news is that kids can use it, too, and young fans of princesses will like it best. It's small enough that kids can lie down on it with no worries. Most adults won't be able to fit their full body on top without their legs dangling over the edge, but that's okay. It is still fun to use and good for general floating.<br /><br />We go through a good deal of floats with our pool. Poolmaster Swimming Pool Float Rainbow Glitter Tiara Tube has made quite a splash with my kiddos.

My latest acquisition is the Fisher- Price Jump N Jam Guitar.<br /><br />Designed for youngsters age 3 and up, this guitar is quite small in size and won't be suitable for bigger kids. It features a minimal number of tones and kids play it by jumping up and down. There are no strings like on other toy guitars, so there are no worries there. It is designed to produce a few simple sounds and that is it.<br /><br />I like the bright colors of this toy guitar and it does serve to satisfy the desires of a young, budding musician. However, because it is so simple, kids are likely to lose interest in a short time. If a child is very young, I think they will like this and continue to like it for some time. But older kids will likely grow tired of it. For this reason, and the small size, I question the recommended age of 3 and up. I think it is best for younger toddlers.<br /><br />This Fisher Price guitar takes batteries, but the cool thing is that it comes with batteries, ready to use straight from the package. It's an okay toy overall that may or may not be a hit for your child or grandchild.",

    "text": "Toddlers love to play and they benefit from toys that encourage learning or help in other areas of development. One toy that seems promising in these ways is the B'S Eye View Peg Puzzle Dexterity Toy – Classic Wooden Puzzle for Toddlers.<br /><br />This puzzle has knobs on the pieces, making it easy for toddlers to grab each piece. It helps with coordination, too, as little ones will learn to fit the right shape into the right slot. However, the colors of the pieces are washed out and they really need to be an eye catching primary. Not only would it be more inviting to toddlers and preschoolers but it would provide an opportunity to not only teach numbers and counting, but color recognition too while playing.<br /><br />Another issue with the pieces is that the details are lacking. If you are going to add detail make it something a child can recognize. But probably the most shocking oversight is the shapes and numbers that they are supposed to match. There is an octagon, for example, that represents the number 7, a five- pointed star that is used for the number 8, and so on. Why would you do this? The octagon should be the number 8 and the star should match with number 5. This is an oversight that someone should have caught.<br /><br />Other issues I have are with the puzzle holes- they are a little too big and this would be hard to travel anywhere with. I do like that the numbers are nice and big and easy to see and that the knobs are big and tall enough for tiny fingers to grasp. While I haven't seen it happen yet I do worry because, since they are very much like thumbtacks, they may come loose and eventually get lost. The pieces don't hold in place as well as I would like.<br /><br />Toddler toys that help kids learn are nice and while the B'S Eye View Peg Puzzle Dexterity Toy – Classic Wooden Puzzle for Toddlers does help with coordination and other skills, it lacks in other areas. The oversight with the numbers and shapes not matching is a big one and I have other issues, too. So, when I think of everything as a whole, this toy gets a thumbs down from me.",

But kids will most likely want to use the other view finder and look at the zoo animals.<br /><br />There are no batteries needed for this toy. It is completely mechanical in nature. And like the pocket cameras from the past, it has an attached loop so that kids can carry it on their wrist.<br /><br />The camera is recommended for kids age 2 to 5, but younger toddlers can enjoy it, too.

But there is also something to be said for a train that isn't electronic and requires imagination more than anything. This is what you get with the Battat Deluxe Wooden Train.<br /><br />This train set comes with track, train, and a large number of accessories. It's easy to assemble the track because it interlocks with almost no effort. Setting up the accessories takes time, but this is perfect for the more imaginative child and parents will enjoy just sitting back and letting their youngster take over.<br /><br />The quality level of this set is good and the pieces are made from wood. Once assembled, it covers about four feet by three feet of space, so it will fit on most tables. If you don't have available table space to spare, just set it up on the floor instead. A smooth surface is best, of course, but a flat carpet may work, too.<br /><br />With the train cars, they are held together by magnets and this is good enough for this type of train. One issue some people may have is with the track. The interlocking isn't very secure and that means the track is easy to bump out of place. Metal tracks hold together better, but this isn't a huge issue, really. Most kids won't mind this aspect of the set up.<br /><br />There are some really cool electronic trains on the market, but trains that require manual movements and that lack sound and other automated features can be just as fun. The Battat Deluxe Wooden Train is good for this purpose. It's made with a good deal of quality in mind and it's great for stimulating a child's imagination.",

    "title": "Durable Cards for Everyday Use",
    "text": "Most every home has at least one deck of playing cards. There are so many games that can be played with a deck of cards that it makes sense to have them handy, but some playing cards are less durable than others and more likely to wear out in a short time. If you want cards that last, a good choice is Nod Products Dry Decks Waterproof Playing Cards.<br /><br />Nod Products makes several different versions of these cards, with a pair of decks in each package. The differences are with the back of card design. This specific set shows a beer jug on one of the sets and an assortment of small symbols like beer glasses, barrels, barely etc. on the other. Nod Products has a set for different tastes and since I'm a beer writer, this set is perfect for me.<br /><br />As for the cards, they are more durable than most, with a plastic coating that protects the cards from wear and tear. The coating is very good- you can wipe off the cards if they come on contact with food or drink, making them look like new. They are slick and don't stick together, either, so you are less likely to experience a misdeal during your next round of euchre.<br /><br />My one issue I have with these cards is the lack of detail on the main side of the card. The King, Queen, and Jack do not feature a face. All you get is a double image of the suit, in the middle of the card. The same is true with the numbered cards. Whether you're holding up a 2, 6, Jack, or any other card, you have the same image in the middle: A pair of hearts, diamonds, spades, or clubs. I would like it better if there was something more artistic and visual.<br /><br />Playing cards are a household essential and Nod Products Dry Decks Waterproof Playing Cards with Beer images is a good set of cards. I would like them more if they had better images on the main side of the cards, but I love the durability and they are great when you like to play cards while you eat and drink.",

    "text": "With a large in-ground pool in my backyard, we spend a good deal of time outdoors. The pool is great for cooling off during our hot Gulf Coast summer season and we have a fair number of pool toys to keep us entertained. The Aqua Flash Scorch the Dragon LED Light Up Pool Float is our latest addition to our growing and expanding number of pool accessories.<br /><br />This pool float is large in size and can hold two young kids with ease. You just inflate, add the lights, and you're ready to go. There are no batteries included, so you will likely need to run to the store to purchase some, since each of the puck lights requires three batteries. Pick up a large pack of alkaline batteries and you should be all set.<br /><br />With its large size, this float makes an imposing presence in the pool, but the coolest aspect of this float is the added lights. It comes with a remote control so you can switch the patterns around, from strobe to fade to flash to smooth. My kids like the lights more than anything. They already have plenty of other floats, but none of them have lights like this. During the evening hours, the flashing lights really help to spruce up a party. I did notice that the float does lose air after a few days and we have to re- inflate, but this is common with most floats and isn't an important issue.<br /><br />Aqua flash Scorch the Dragon LED turned out to be hugely popular with my family and it has been a great addition to our pool. There is no shortage of pool floats on the market, but the difference with this float is the lights. They really add to the float's appeal and make it an excellent choice as your next pool accessory.",

    "title": "Fun Solar System Model for Budding Astronomers",
    "text": "Do you have a young astronomer in your home? I do, and her love of outer space convinced me to get her the Geosafari Motorized Solar System, a model of the solar system with planets, lights, etc.<br /><br />Assembling this solar system is the first thing you need to do. Kids who already know about the solar system and planet order will have no problem placing the planets in the correct spot. Once the planets are set, just hit the switch and watch them turn. The inner planets move faster than the outer planets, for a dose of realism. It would be even better if each planet moved at its own, relative speed, but the technology isn't quite at that level. Still, it's good the way it is and better than other models that either don't have the planets move at all or all move at the same speed.<br /><br />One of the other fun features of this solar system is the constellation projection. Just turn off the lights and it will project constellations on the surrounding ceiling and walls. This is cool for scientifically minded youngsters who will love watching as their bedroom is transformed into a planetarium. And it will shutoff automatically, so you don't need to worry about burning out the light too quickly.<br /><br />The Geosafari Motorized Solar System is fun and educational, but there are a few ways it could be improved. One would be to turn it into a craft by including colored paints so that kids can paint each planet before assembly. Another would be to make it a little more realistic, as stated above, with the movements by making them relative based on the planet's actual orbit speed. This might seem like I'm asking too much but trust me- if the young astronomer in your home is up to speed on his/her solar system like mine is, one of the first questions they will ask is why the inner planets move at the same speed and the outer planets move at the same speed, since this isn't realistic. Some kids will even wonder why the planets are not relatively sized also, but I realize and most kids will realize that this would not be practical because it would require making some planets either very big or very small.<br /><br />Regardless of these concerns, kids who love astronomy will enjoy the Geosafari Motorized Solar System. The movement of the planets and the projection features are both quite cool and budding astronomers should find everything mostly to their liking. It's good for learning and fun, and a nice gift idea for youngsters.",

    "text": "My kids like their science, particularly my youngest who envisions, among other things, working for the government and taking part in the first mission to Mars. So, given my kids interest in all things scientific, the Tin Can Edge Detector looked like something they would enjoy building and examining from a scientific point of view.<br /><br />Putting this little machine together takes some effort and one reason it takes more work than it should is the instructions. They are not written as clearly as they should be. It would not have been that difficult for the manufacturer to get this right, but it seems they put little effort into it. You have to supply your own battery and a can, but most importantly, you have to be patient and give it time. It's also best to have an adult take charge, as young children will grow frustrated if they attempt this on their own.<br /><br />Once assembled, you just place the robot on a table and let it do its thing. As expected, it moves across the surface until it detects an edge, then it reverses itself. It seemed to have no trouble doing what it claimed, and that is detecting when it reached the table's edge and not falling off. In that respect, the robot functions as it should.<br /><br />Now, what about the science? Well, It can teach a little bit about robotics, but that is about the extent of the educational value. There isn't much else to it. Oh, and green advocates will like that it requires you to provide your own soda can because it encourages recycling<br /><br />Science is a popular subject with my kids but they had a difficult time getting fired up over the Tin Can Edge Detector. The problem, from a kid's perspective, is that it doesn't really do enough to make it interesting. Simply crawling around on a table and not falling off just didn't cut it for my kids. Adults will dislike the assembly more than anything and the limited educational value is also a drawback. Still, it does offer kids and parents an excuse to spend a little time together and it does what the manufacturer claims, so I'm going to give it a middle rating and a passing grade. There are better educational toys, but there is enough here to keep kids semi- interested for a low price.",

    "text": "Do your kids enjoy science? Mine certainly do and they love anything that is interactive and involves more than simply reading a book. This is why they love science kits the way they do and one kit they really enjoy is the Thames and Kosmos Nanotechnology Kit.<br /><br />I have purchased countless science kits over the years for my youngsters and my kids have played with each, often with varying degrees of interest. The problem with many science kits is that the package doesn't really contain enough to conduct the experiments- you are required to supply almost all of the materials, measuring devices, etc. yourself. Another problem is that many of science kits contain experiments that are too simple and don't really challenge any child beyond the age of six. But with Thames and Kosmos Nanotechnology Kit, my children and I quickly discovered that a store purchased science kit can be fun, challenging, and complete. You know the moment you open the box that this science kit is different and the uniqueness only serves to encourage children to open the manual and start conducting experiments. Just looking at the contents reminded me of the science from high school.<br /><br />The science experiments in this kit revolve around the world of nanotechnology and they serve to educate children on this tiny, micro world. The experiments deliver on their promises and kids really do learn a great deal. Some of the experiments are actually more complex than expected so if your kids are younger, you may need to step in and offer your assistance. I didn't mind at all, in part because, as I completed the experiments with my kids, I found that I enjoyed the experience just about as much as they did.<br /><br />Another added touch I like with this kit is the included game board. This is a great idea, because the board helps to further educate children by showing how different experiments relate to each other. Everything is diagrammed and once kids see the visual representation, they will better understand how each experiment works and how things tie together.<br /><br />Educational toys are great and make for an important diversion from the mindless drabble so common to most forms of child amusement. Thames and Kosmos Nanotechnology is one of the best science kits I have ever encountered and while the price is a little higher than that of other kits, it is certainly money well invested and it will help develop a child's understanding and interest in science to levels you never would have thought possible.",

The manufacturer keeps doing what it can to keep people interested, coming out with new versions of Barbie every so often like this one, Secret Agent Barbie.<br /><br />My girls don't rank Barbie as their favorite doll character, but they do like her and so they welcomed the chance to add Secret Agent Barbie to their collection. They and I both agree that Barbie's outfit is cool, with lots of color and style. She looks like a million bucks, ready to take on any secret mission that comes her way.<br /><br />The extra feature with Secret Agent Barbie is the attachable device that can be used to assist Barbie with flips and cartwheels. The device attaches to her back, but we found it only semi- useful and not that much fun. The problem is there are limits to what this device can do and it doesn't always work the way it should. It just seems very artificial to have these moves initiated by a device stuck in the doll's back. My kid quickly grew tired of the attachment, tossed it aside, and played with the doll her own way, which was actually better because it encouraged her own imagination.<br /><br />So, overall, Secret Agent Barbie seems like an okay doll and an acceptable addition to your child's collection. It seems more of a gimmick than anything else and it makes you wonder how the idea got past the new product development team, as it isn't that fun or interesting. Still, it's got enough going for it to recommend.",

And, as expected, she liked the Monster High Designer Boo- tique Frankie Stein Doll and Fashions quite a bit and enjoyed creating fashions with the included accessories.<br /><br />Most people think of Barbie when they think of dolls, but my kid likes the Monster High series better and I would have to agree with her, as Barbie is rather old fashioned and too commonplace. With this set, kids get a more original doll that they can design using the included clothing, markers, stencils, and stickers. This creative angle is the greatest part of the fun and girls will enjoy switching out the clothing and making Frankie look as cool and mod as possible.<br /><br />About the only issue my kid had with this doll- and one I see that other reviewers have- is that the arms do not bend. This lack of mobility does take away a little from the overall appeal and I don't know why the manufacturer made the doll this way, especially since other dolls in the Monser High series are made with movable arms. Adding some joints, at least at the elbow, would make things better.<br /><br />Monster High is a popular toy theme with my girl and the Monster High Designer Boo- tique Frankie Stein Doll and Fashions is a doll she likes. She even pulls it out from time to time and continues to play, which is more that can be said for most of her other toys. Other than the issue with the movability of the arms, this is a fun set for Monster High fans and young fashionistas.",

It offers educational value and entertainment as children set out to use tools, gather evidence, and solve crimes.<br /><br />My kids like science and problem solving so they took a quick liking to Catch the Thief. They were a little confused at first by some of the clues, but they all come together in the end and make sense once the crime is solved- much like in real life. There are a total of three crimes to solve and my kids had a lot of fun cracking each case.<br /><br />Some of the accessories included with this game are not really necessary and so are more gimmicks than anything. But the others are useful and more imaginative kids may even introduce their own tools and methods as they solve each case. Again, this is much better than the average toy or game, many of which have little if any redeeming educational or learning value.<br /><br />It would be nice if there were even more mysteries to solve with Catch the Thief, but what it offers is still good and the price is right. The items included do not get used up, so once the three mysteries have been solved, the game can be used again. It makes a good, inexpensive gift item for children and while not flawless, it is still a good toy/game option if you have kids between eight and approximately thirteen years of age.",

There is enough material in the package to create 5 necklaces, making it perfect for your young one to try with her friends as part of a birthday party or gathering.<br /><br />This craft is recommended for kids age 8 to 12 and it does include small parts. Younger children will not be able to complete this on their own and will need help but children at least 8 years of age shouldn't have any trouble.

It hooks on the top of most doors so you can lie in bed and practice shooting or attach it to your office door at work for some quick stress relief.<br /><br />Out of the box, this basketball hoop requires some assembly, but it shouldn't take long to attach the parts and prep it for use. The hooks that attach it to a door are not adjustable, but they are designed to fit a wide range of door thicknesses. After attaching, you may notice that it lacks stability. I noticed it, too, but I also found that it didn't matter. It doesn't need to be completely stable because the weight of the included basketball is so light. Throw after throw results in no bouncing or other movement for me, so don't worry if the hoop seems less secure than you would prefer. Unless your door is very thin, it should be fine.<br /><br />Once you have the ball inflated, the toy is ready for use. You may want to set everything in direct light for a few hours at first, to help with the glowing. If you don't, then the glow will be very faint. Still, it should be enough to make it visible in the dark so that, if you use this at home, you or your kids can see it in the dark and play before you fall asleep. One thing that new buyers need to realize is that, due to the thickness of the hooks, it may not be possible to close the door to which this is attached. My door won't close, but I attached it to a door that normally stays open all of the time anyway. If your door won't close with this attached, then you will have no choice but to go back and forth, taking it down and putting it back up.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a good toy and it should be fun for the basketball enthusiast in your home. There is no glass and the construction is made to last. The glow in the dark feature could be better, but other than that, it seems like an entertaining way to pass the time.",

With this slime lab, the mixture is placed atop a motor that vibrates for greater effect. Kids can watch the colors and textures swirl around as the vibrations create some fun and very visual patterns. The instructions include 20 different recipes for slime and each can be made using items found in most kitchens.<br /><br />What I probably like best about this slime lab is the lack of mess! Okay, there is some mess but in relative terms, the messiness is kept under control very well. The key difference is that, with most other slime labs my kids have used, messiness is encouraged. These other labs involve sticking hands in the slime, spreading it with your hands, and so on. This is messy and gross, and if multiple kids are involved, they often end up smearing it on each other, splattering it on the floors and more. There is no problem like that with SmartLab. The slime, for the most part, stays in the bowl, out of your way.<br /><br />Educational toys are nice and SmartLab Toys It's Alive Slime Lab is a toy that does get kids thinking and asking questions. My girls like it and have returned to it more than once, creating more slime and learning about household chemicals and how they react. It's a good choice of toy that will keep kids entertained as they learn.",

    "text": "A good toy for toddlers, the Fisher Price 3 in 1 Bounce, Ride and Stride Elephant helps youngsters develop while having fun. The toy lets then bounce, ride, and walk along as they listen to the sounds and enjoy the light up buttons and songs.<br /><br />This toy is intended for toddlers under the age of 3 and most will take to it right away. Those on the younger side will like bouncing more than anything while those toward the upper end of the recommended age range will like riding and pushing. My youngest child is outside of the recommended age range, but she is lightweight for her age and liked riding the most. It takes a little bit of effort, but with just a small amount of leg power, young children can push themselves along without any assistance.<br /><br />Kids will love the sounds and lights that are part of this toy. The good news for parents is that you can shut off the sounds- a feature you don't always get with similar toys. This is nice for adults who get impatient with the constant sounds coming from kids' toys. In truth, the sound isn't that loud or that bad with this toy, but it's nice to know that it can be shut off, if desired.<br /><br />A toy that encourages activity, keeps kids interested, and helps them develop has all the makings of a keeper and this toy is just that. The price could turn some people away, but it's not too bad and the fun and other advantages make this toy worth the money.",

They love anything that encourages artistic expression and they love Play- Doh so the DohVinci Peace Project Complete Design Kit was an obvious choice to introduce to my household.<br /><br />This design kit contains all of the accessories and material needed to create the peace sign art depicted. The instructions step kids through the process and when finished, they have their own work of art, ready for display.<br /><br />DohVinci Peace Project Complete Design Kit is a good choice for the creative kids in the family and mine, as expected, took to it right away. What they loved more than anything is the gun tool that dispenses the colors of Play- Doh. They liked making the designs and all we had to do was wait a short time for it to dry and the artwork was completed.<br /><br />As I said, this craft kit is good for encouraging creativity and I must mention that it encouraged my girls in more ways than expected. I noticed that there was still plenty of Play- Doh left when they finished and I later learned that my girls intended it that way. They purposely used it sparingly so that they would have leftovers to use on other projects. With some construction paper, yarn, and other household materials, they proceeded to create more works of art, much of which were even more interesting than the Peace Project itself.<br /><br />Creative expression is a good quality and something worth encouraging. With the DohVinci Peace Project Complete Design Kit, kids are presented with something to test their creative skills in a fairly easy to follow manner. It can sometimes encourage even greater creativity, like it did with my kids, making it that much more valuable. The price is low and the benefits are high, earning this kit an easy recommendation.",

    "text": "Baby Alive is an iconic doll. She was one of the first dolls that not only took a bottle, but also ate food, mixed and served to her from premade packets. She has been available in many different versions, each with the same eat/drink concept with a slightly different variation. My Baby All Gone is one of the latest Baby Alive dolls and she will easily keep your little one serving, feeding, changing, and burping her baby for hours.<br /><br />What sets this Baby Alive doll apart from most of the others in the series is her ability to say so many different things. She still takes a bottle, eats food, pees, and poops just like the other Baby Alive dolls, but for a more realistic twist, she makes periodic statements from her wee little mouth. She will say that she wants to cuddle, that she just went pee, and so on. Her baby- ish voice and cute sayings will appeal strongly to young girls still going through their mommy phase.<br /><br />My girls are both in their early years of elementary school, but they still like dolls and they like Baby Alive My Baby All Gone Doll just as much if not more than the others in the series, of which they have quite a few dolls. What they like best is the feature that sets this doll apart: The sayings, mentioned above. They like that she says so many different things- more than 30 sayings in all- because it makes her seem more real. I agree that the multitude of sayings is a vast improvement on other dolls that, while they might speak, say only three or four different things. My girls like playing the role of mommy, changing diapers, giving Baby Alive a nap, and everything else that goes with being a mom.<br /><br />The one disadvantage of this Baby Alive doll is the same disadvantage with the others- you have to constantly purchase refill packs. Trust me, the few packs of food and the small number of diapers will not last long at all! In a matter of a day or two out of the package, your girls will be asking for replacement food and diapers. We have had this doll in our household for only about 10 days and have already ordered a refill pack.<br /><br />Little girls often like to play the role of a mommy and Baby Alive is one of the best dolls for interactive mommy play. My girls like her very much and I like that they are happy. The cost of the refill packs can add up, so try to improvise when you can or create your own cloth diapers that can be washed and reused. Then watch as the young girl in your household practices her mommy role with a doll that, while not alive, is about as close as you can get to the real thing.",

    "title": "Help Baby Alive Heal Her Wounds",
    "text": "Baby Alive Baby Gets a Boo Boo is yet another version of the Baby Alive doll that my sisters enjoyed growing up more than three decades ago. With this Baby Alive, the theme isn't eating and drinking- it's helping the baby heal the wounds on her body.<br /><br />With Baby Alive Baby Gets a Boo Boo, there is one interesting feature, and that is the wound on the baby's knee. It has a bandage all its own that cannot be completely removed, but can be opened, to check the wound. Each time your child checks, the sore will look different and will slowly heal. This is an interesting concept and not like any I have seen on a baby doll before.<br /><br />Other than the wound that slowly heals, the other qualities of this doll are not really anything special. Yes, she does drink from her bottle and yes, she goes pee in her diaper and has to be changed. This is actually rather annoying because only one diaper is included and it is ruined and must be disposed of after a single use. If your child really wants to feed the baby her bottle, it might be a good idea to find something permanent that you can just remove and toss in the dryer. Buying replacement Baby Alive diapers can get expensive and prove to be very inconvenient.<br /><br />Besides the bottle and diaper, Baby Alive Gets a Boo Boo also comes with a sheet of bandages and an ointment bottle that can be used to heal her boo boos. Kids can use their imagination a little bit and pretend they are helping their doll overcome her owies. But once this is done a few times, it may grow old. My girls got tired of this doll after only a couple of days and relegated Baby Alive Baby Gets a Boo Boo to their toy box, where she has been ever since.<br /><br />Girls love their dollies and a new and different doll is a welcome change of pace. But this Baby Alive Doll didn't seem to pass the test of time in my household. The healing wound on the knee is interesting, but everything else if very ordinary and overdone. It's an average doll overall, recommended only for the die- hard Baby Alive fan and other children who just can't get enough of applying bandages to wounds and checking their status.",

They enjoy anything with a Disney theme, at least at first, and can always find something to like, even with the more average toys or merchandise.<br /><br />Such is the case with this, the Disney Princess Water Palace Playset. My girls did like it at first because, well, it is Disney after all and it does feature the Ariel character, who happens to be one of their favorites. They took to the toy immediately, but they and I lost interest a little bit along the way for different reasons.<br /><br />From a parent's perspective, this toy is rather cheaply made and some of the parts do not want to stay in place. I had to constantly refasten one of the pieces until I finally gave up and attached a piece of tape. It doesn't seem made to last and its flimsiness means it could be crushed very easily and completely ruined if one is careless.<br /><br />From a child's perspective, the toy does have some cool features like the slide and waterfall. The Ariel doll that comes with the toy is cute, but my girls were quick to point out that she doesn't really look like the Ariel made popular by the Disney movie Little Mermaid. I'm not sure why they did this. It would have been better to have Ariel look the way she usually looks.<br /><br />Still, in spite of its shortcomings, there is enough good to be found with this toy to give it the slightest recommendation. It can make bath time more fun and while my girls usually push it aside in favor of more enjoyable toys, they still turn to it every now and then. It's not the best Disney themed toy in the bunch, but it does seem to have enough good points to make it worth buying for the Disney fanatic in your home.",

Their love of all things fashion led me to the Alex Toys Craft Tres Chic Designer Look Back, a toy intended to bring out the young fashion designer in your home.<br /><br />As expected, my girls took an instant liking to this kit and they are still using it today. There are other fashion toys like this one, but this is one of the better ones for a several good reasons. The greatest among them is the sheer contents of the package. With 390 essentials, there is enough here to keep your young fashion designer going for a long time. The stencil and patterned paper are the best features of the kit, as they keep kids occupied for hours and can be used to creative fun, stylish designs. The kit really succeeds at releasing a child's inner creativity, and that alone makes it worth the purchase.<br /><br />About the only item I don't find very useful is the included scissors- they don't cut well at all and should be discarded. You will need to supply your own. The manufacturer would be best off if they just eliminated this item. Most homes already have multiple pairs of scissors anyway, so the inclusion of scissors is unnecessary.<br /><br />Once kids are finished creating fashions, they can store them in the included book. It all makes for a very fun fashion kit that creative, stylish children will love and continue to use for quite some time. In the words of my girls, Alex Toys Craft Tres Chic Designer Look Back is awesome, plain and simple.",

So, when I brought this toy into the home, I felt like my girls were going to like it and enjoy it about as much as any other. They like the Sofia character and I felt fairly confident they would take quickly to any toy featuring her likeness.<br /><br />Out of the box, this toy requires some assembly. It isn't too difficult, but there was one piece that would not snap into place no matter how hard I tried. I finally gave up and left the way it is. The manufacturer could have already assembled some of the pieces, but chose not to.<br /><br />Once put together, the toy was ready for play. It is made entirely of plastic and looks nice enough, but I did notice that it isn't very sturdy. The height and lightweight design make it easy to knock over. On the good side, the Sofia character is cute and the toy seemed like it might have enough going for it to score a hit with my girls. Unfortunately, they just don't seem to find this toy all that exciting. I don't know if it's the lack of bells and whistles or the fact that they already have so many better Disney toys. Whatever the reason, they seemed to lose interest in this toy very quickly.<br /><br />My girls like Disney- themed toys very much, but some toys are certainly better than others and this isn't one of them. It isn't a bad toy, but its design, lack of sturdiness and absence of a wow factor make it very ordinary overall and worthy of only an average rating at best.",

It takes little effort to get going. You just add the application to your smartphone or tablet, and then have your child start drawing.

This caused squeals of satisfaction from my girls who loved seeing their fashion on screen.<br /><br />From my children's perspectives, there is little that isn't perfect with a toy like this, but as an adult, I can see a few issues. One has already been stated by others who have used the device, but bears repeating: The phone or tablet you use will make a difference. Not all smartphones or tablets are created equally and the colors may look a little off. If you have more than one device and it doesn't look good on one, then you might want to consider downloading the application to another device. It could make a difference and it's simple enough to do.<br /><br />The included accessories with the Crayola My Virtual Fashion Show are a little limited. The small colored pencils are also somewhat of an obstacle, as they are not good for larger hands.

It encourages kids to conduct science experiments, each with an emphasis on learning and on creating something, well, gross and disgusting.<br /><br />My girls love the subject of science and they did like this science set when it was introduced to them for the first time. I was a little disappointed when I opened the box and found it contained so little. You get three molds- one for barf, one for a centipede, and one for a maggot; a toilet mixer; a plastic jar; a bubble wand; spoon; two beakers and a stand. A small booklet with experiment ideas gets kids and parents started so they can create and laugh at so many gross things.<br /><br />With the experiments, there are a total of 20 and some of them are fun for kids. But one problem I have is that every single one of them requires household ingredients, which you may or may not have. We were still able to do some of them right away because all they required was baking soda, corn starch, eggs, etc. But others required a special visit to the store and this could be upsetting to children and parents who want to open the box and start experimenting immediately.<br /><br />What you get with this science kit isn't much, but I must admit that it does get kids interested in science even more than before. In fact, that might be the most compelling reason to buy this science kit. It helps pique kids' interests and makes them want to investigate more about the world around them. Other than that, this is a toy of average worth that may or may not satisfy those who buy it.",

It takes some patience, but most young girls will enjoy the experience. It is a good idea to remain nearby so that you, the adult, can step in and help when necessary. Depending on the age of your child, some may need a little encouragement and assistance, so be prepared to help out. Some of the steps are somewhat tedious and it could try the patience of even the most easy- going child, so be ready to lend a helping hand.<br /><br />Once the project is complete, most kids will tell you it was worth the trouble. The finished product is a fully functioning clock, about the same size as other round, wall- mounted clocks, but much cuter. It requires one AA battery but like with most clocks, the power is drained very slowly so it will last for many months. The finished clock is lightweight and easy to mount. Kids will be very proud of their work of art and many will want to mount it in their own bedrooms, but others will be perfectly happy placing it in a common area of the house, for all to see.<br /><br />Crafts are a great change of pace for kids and the American Girls Craft Button Clock Kit is certainly a craft worth considering if you have young, artistic girls. My young girls love American Girl dolls and they took to this right away.

This is what kids get with the Melissa & Doug Happy Handle Stamp Kit. The set includes ten different stamps, six colors of ink, and 5 colored pencils for artistic fun.<br /><br />This stamp kit has all of the minimum requirements necessary for some quick and simple fun. Kids will have no problem using the wooden stamps and the colored pencils and they can make all sorts of creations with stamp impressions that include a rainbow, cat, flowers, stars, etc. Six different colors is more than enough variety and children will enjoy stamping the different symbols on other works of art or on a sheet of paper all by themselves. When kids are finished for the day, everything stores nicely and neatly in the wooden box.<br /><br />The six included ink colors represented the standard colors of the color wheel: Red, blue, yellow, green, orange, and purple. This is great for kids who like lots of choices, but the one obvious issue is the same one other reviewer have mentioned: The colors will get all muddled up if the stamps are not cleaned off. You can lecture and remind kids to clean before changing to a different color, but we all know that most kids will forget. This is why, once the ink is used up, you might be best off purchasing a single color as a replacement.<br /><br />I have always liked Melissa & Doug product and after using the Melissa & Doug Happy Handle Stamp Kit, my positive opinion remains intact. The colored pencils are not quite as good in quality as the stamps, but the wooden construction, cute handles and designs, and multiple color options make this another worthwhile product from M & D.",

Once opened, the drop- down doors feature a telescope on one side and cannon on the other. Kids will have fun and most will use their imagination to make up stories as they play. Shooting the make- believe cannon with the included pieces is fun and it adds an element of action to an otherwise mechanical, battery- free play set.<br /><br />As for the manufacture of the toy, it is made from plastic construction and it seems semi- durable. That is, it should last as long as kids are careful, but certain parts seem like they will break if mishandled. The small pieces can get lost, but this is true of most toys of this type. You can't expect to get a large doll or figurine with a toy designed to fit on a small table top. The pieces are small, so your child needs to keep them stored in a safe place. We haven't lost any yet, but it is only a matter of time until the cannon pieces get lost. I am glad they included three of them in this set. That way, you can lose two of them and still have one, which is really all you need.<br /><br />One way they could improve this toy is by including more figures, particularly a Captain Hook figure, since he is a major character in the cartoon. As it is presently sold, it is a nice start but many kids will want more. If money permits, I would suggest purchasing this along with one of the Jake and the Neverland Pirate ships, which usually come with a Hook doll. This would really add to the fun and young fans of the show would be most appreciative.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fun toy for kids and most of them- even those who are unfamiliar with the cartoon- will find it to their liking. It is cute and it has enough action and other qualities to make it a hit with the target age group.",

They like using the different doll houses for make- believe play and they like using their imaginations as they place the different dolls inside the house and use the different accessories.<br /><br />Since my kids already have a good number of doll houses, one might assume they would have little interest in adding another one to the collection. But once they saw this doll house, they fell in love immediately. Easily the largest doll house they play with, they like it most of all and it is the only one not made from plastic. It has a more impressive appearance and the use of wood sets it apart from all of the other doll houses in their play area. The house is close to 4 feet high, 2.5 feet wide, contains 3 levels, and has a large amount of space where even the larger barbies and other dolls can easily fit.<br /><br />Putting this doll house together takes only a small effort and once complete, I must agree with my girls that it does stand out in the doll house crowd. The wood is pressed board, but it is still stronger than the materials used in other doll houses. Most others are made from plastic and the plastic is thin, making it easy to accidentally bend or otherwise ruin the doll house and its accessories. I don't see that type of problem here. As long as the kiddos can keep moisture away, this doll house seems like it was made to last. And the accessories are large, too. Most accessories with other, smaller doll houses are so tiny, I can reasonably expect my girls to lose at least one every week. But these pieces are much larger than average and are easy to contain.<br /><br />A pink, girly doll house is just right for those with young lasses and my girls have certainly taken a liking to this doll house. It ranks as their favorite one of all and judging by its size, appearance, and wood construction, I would have to agree that this outranks all other doll houses in our home and is certainly deserving of a five star rating.",

    "title": "Toddlers Welcome and No Drivers License Required",
    "text": "Toddlers like most any toy with moving parts and the Peg Perego John Deere Mini Power Loader is just the toy for some fun, safe action. It looks much like an authentic John Deere tractor and young children will love it the moment they take the seat and take control.<br /><br />This tractor utilizes a rechargeable motor and it reaches a speed of only about 2 miles per hour, so kids are safe. I wondered at first about the safety of this toy more than anything, but the slower than expected speed put my mind at ease. The fact that it auto- brakes is also a plus. I wasn't too sure how this vehicle would stop, then I learned that it automatically brakes the moment the child lets go of the accelerator. And even if a child is moving at full speed, there is really not enough momentum to cause any injury.<br /><br />Now, to the fun side of things, because fun is going to be what kids will judge the toy by. From what I have seen, kids are absolutely crazy about this toy. I mean, what toddler wouldn't like climbing aboard a vehicle and making the scoop move and wheels turn by using levers and pedals? Some are pleasantly surprised at first because, while they have likely played with other climb- aboard toy trucks in their day, they have never been on one with an electric motor. The pleasant surprise will have them hooked and, once they start, you may have a hard time getting your child to get off the seat.<br /><br />This toy is a little more expensive than most other toys in your child's room, but the fun they experience, the safe operation, and the lack of the need to buy replacement batteries makes this toy a hit. It's a good option for the preschooler who has everything and wants something new and different from the usual, self- operated toy truck or car.",

    "text": "Monster High toys and accessories are a huge hit with their fan base and the Travel Scaris Convertible vehicle is bound to be a big hit with kids who love Monster High. It is a stylish and attractive toy vehicle with a design that sets it apart from the average kid's toy vehicle.<br /><br />I'm not usually very impressed with toy vehicles because I have seen so many of them and because most of them look very similar. But this toy vehicle grabbed my attention. The cool, eye- catching, all- around design pattern is one that is bound to warrant a second look and both adults and kids alike will find that it easily stands out against other toy vehicles.<br /><br />Aside from the exterior, this Monster High vehicle does have other features that make it cool. The stylish wheels glide smoothly across a tile floor or a table without any problem and the vehicle seats up to four Monster High dolls. Rather than have all four dolls face forward, this convertible is a two- seat model with a pair of seats that are actually on top of the trunk, where the dolls face backward. Again, it's something unique that you don't find with other toy vehicles.<br /><br />The Monster High Travel Scaris Vehicle doesn't have any lights or sounds. This may bother some youngsters, but it is better from an adult perspective because it means no batteries to buy and more imagination required. Most kids will not mind anyway- they will find the vehicle so cool and fun that they will not even notice that it doesn't make noise or have any lights. And another advantage is that boys and girls both seem to like this toy. Girls like it because its Monster High and boys like it because, well, it's a vehicle, which is a toy normally associated with boys.<br /><br />This Monster High vehicle doesn't have opening side doors, and this is one quality that I wish was different because it would not only look cool, but it would also make it easier to place the dolls into the seats. But other than that, this is a fun, nice- looking toy that belongs in the home of every Monster High fan.",

    "title": "A Fast- Paced Dice Game for the Entire Family",
    "text": "Flash is a simple yet fun dice game for the entire family. It consists of six sets of six dice, each distinguished by a different color, six numbered chips for scoring, a score pad with eight challenges and a small pencil, and a storage bag and instructions.<br /><br />Flash is a fast game and this is one of the reasons busy parents and others will enjoy playing it so much. The object of the game is to complete each of the eight challenges faster than your opponents and what makes it move so quickly is that everyone plays at the same time, racing against each other to see who can complete the challenge the most quickly. Unlike Yahtzee and other dice games where each person plays solo while the others wait, this game offers all- out action through each challenge.<br /><br />What are the challenges in Flash? Well, they are basic numbering combinations such as six of a kind, a straight, etc. It sounds like it might be difficult, but it really isn't because each individual die has a flash (lightning bolt) on one side that counts as a wildcard. All you do is throw your dice, keep the ones that you need, then pick up the other dice and throw them again and again until you meet the challenge. Whoever completes it first yells \"Flash\" and picks up the highest scoring chip. Everyone else keeps throwing the dice until they get the challenge correct, but they get a lower scoring chip, all the way down to the number 1 chip. Play continues through all of the challenges and the highest scoring player wins.<br /><br />The simplicity of this game is one of its strongest points and kids seem to like it more than a game such as Yahtzee for several reasons. First, the speed- it's an all- out battle to see who can meet the challenge before anyone else. Second, every challenge is certain to be met, in contrast with Yahtzee where you may or may not be able to complete each of the items on the score sheet. The scoring is simpler, too, and I like that the manufacturer included a small bag in which to place the dice, chips, pencil, and scoring pad because they would eventually get lost without it.<br /><br />If I had to look for something to criticize with this dice game, it would be the fact that the challenges are really not that challenging. No matter how bad your luck may be, you will be able to complete each and every challenge- usually in two minutes max. It is only a matter of time until you roll the right numbers on the dice and the wildcard flash makes each challenge that much easier to achieve.<br /><br />Family game night is part of growing up and Flash is a good game to have around on those nights when you want some family entertainment and only have about 20 minutes or less to spare. It's a fun little game that most anyone will find worthwhile and worth playing.",

    "text": "Barbie is a popular hero in my home. My girls love most anything related in any way to the glam doll with the long blonde hair and because of this, I was confident they would like the Barbie Sisters Twirl and Spin Ride. It seemed like a fun toy to enjoy while they played with their Barbie dolls each day and, as expected, it was welcomed into my home by my girls with open arms.<br /><br />Out of the box, this toy requires some assembly, but one pleasant surprise is that it is easy to figure out how to put it together.  My girls assembled it completely, on their own, without even bothering with the instructions. They just took the pieces and rationally figured out what went where. In no time at all, the toy was assembled and ready for play.<br /><br />As for the entertainment value, this toy scores more hits than misses. The fact that it is Barbie- themed is enough to make it a hit in my home, but my girls liked in for other reasons, too, like the fact that it features an amusement park ride. The three cups/cars turn around much like the scrambler or teacup rides popular at carnivals everywhere. The movement is manually directed- you have to turn the knob at the top to make the three cups spin. The dolls are held in place by a plastic belt so that they can twirl around without falling out. My girls love carnival rides, so the amusement park theme was yet another reason to like this toy.<br /><br />From an adult's perspective, I find several things to like about this toy. Besides making my girls happy, I like that the toy comes with a Barbie doll and doesn't take batteries. But there is one problem with this toy and that is the tendency of the three cups to fall out. The problem is that they are very lightly held in place. They do not snap in firmly and the slightest nudge will knock them off of the base. Re-attach them and, depending on the weight of the Barbie riding in the cup, they may fall out again. This will frustrate many youngsters and parents who have to continuously put the cups back into place.<br /><br />Barbie is beloved by young girls everywhere and the Barbie Sisters Twirl and Spin Ride Playset is a fun little toy to keep them amused and encourage some imagination. I wish the manufacturer had paid a little more attention to the attachment of the cups, but other than this, the Barbie Sisters Twirl and Spin Ride Playset is a good toy that my girls agree is a toy worth owning.",

This castle is much like other Disney castles available on the market, with a few added accessories and everything a young girl needs to enjoy hours of imaginative play.<br /><br />I have two girls who have been Disney fanatics since a young age and still love anything related to Disney- especially the princesses. Their love of Belle, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Aerial, and the other princesses was reason enough to bring this toy into the house. Taking it from the box and assembling a few items was all it took to get the castle ready for play. In no time at all, they were running upstairs to find all of their Disney Princess dolls and bringing then downstairs to play with their new castle.<br /><br />Disney Princess Royal Castle is a cute castle and very girly in appearance, making it just right for Disney Princess fans. My girls like the castle and they love anything that accommodates their Disney princess dolls. They also like making up stories as they play, but they and I both agree that this castle isn't they greatest one with which they have played. One reason is the lack of any sound effects, movements, etc. I am thankful that the castle includes no lights or anything that requires batteries, but it would be nice if it at least offered some mechanical movements, sound chips, or something else.  Another issue is the small upper level. This is where the bedroom is located and it is much smaller than the area below. It would be better if the two levels were a little more even.<br /><br />My girls love anything Disney Princess related and they like this castle, but they do not rank it among their favorites and it is easy to see why. The lack of at least a simple sound effect, the small number of accessories, and the lack of folding or another way to make storing easier all add up to an average toy overall.",

Instead, you just place her in the tub, swimming pool, etc., and once the moisture- sensing mechanism detects water, the mermaid starts to swim.<br /><br />Judging this doll by my girls' reactions, Moxie Girlz Magic Swim Mermaid Doll is a big hit and worthy of a high rating. My girls' love mermaids and they love the water. They love Barbie and, while this is not a Barbie doll, it does look like one and that only adds to her appeal.<br /><br />This doll is interesting in the way she starts to swim upon touching the water. I didn't know she worked this way at first and I kept looking for an on/off switch that wasn't there. A quick check of the internet and I learned that the doll turns herself on and off. However, I noticed that she doesn't stop flapping immediately. She will continue to squirm and flap when taken from the tub and my girls have described it as a little creepy. It takes time for her to stop.<br /><br />So far, this doll has held up but it just seems like a matter of time until something goes wrong. The batteries are one concern. They are difficult to get in and out and part of the reason is because the compartment needs to be water tight. In my estimation, it seems like only a matter of time before the water seeps in and the doll malfunctions or before something else goes wrong. I noticed from reading other reviews that this has already been the case for others. I will keep my fingers crossed, but I won't be that surprised if the doll stops swimming at some point.<br /><br />Still, rated for what it is and for the joy it has brought my girls, this seems to be a good toy. It has been loads of fun for my girls who continue to play with it every time they take a bath. They will likely use it until it breaks down completely- I just hope that moment isn't just around the corner, like I fear.",

Dressed in her evening attire with a cast on her leg, she wants nothing more than for your child to cuddle her and nurse her back to health.<br /><br />This little doll wants to regain her good health and kids can help by feeding her from her bottle, listening to her heart beat, and/or washing away her sores with warm water. She has two sets of pajamas and a bathrobe that can be interchanged whenever a child likes and her heart makes different sounds like that of a ticking clock, a frog, and a whistle. The heart sounds will result in endless giggling from most kids as they press the doll's belly and listen through the included stethoscope.<br /><br />My girls like this doll and more than anything, they seem to like the stethoscope and listening to the sounds from the doll's heart. They like changing the dolls clothing, too, but one surprise is that they didn't get too thrilled over the feature whereby the doll's sores are healed and disappear. You add some warm water to the bandage, apply it to the sores, and they go away. This is easily the most unique feature the doll offers, but my girls were only lukewarm about it.<br /><br />Lalaloopsy Littles Sew Cute Patient Doll is a cute little doll and, based on my girls' responses, she ranks better than average, but not at any level approaching outstanding. They like taking care of her and continue to use the stethoscope, but they are only so- so on the other features, including the bear, which doesn't do much except allow his limbs and ears to be interchanged. They still play with the doll from time to time, however, and the stethoscope did encourage them to ask questions about the human heart and its functions, so the doll scores some points in that respect.<br /><br />So, what is my bottom line on this doll? Well, my girls and I agree that she is very cute and some of the accessories are fun. They like the play that the doll provides and even though they do not play with her as much as they play with their favorite dolls, the doll still has enough to offer to make her deserving of a look and she makes a good choice of dolls for fans of the Lalaloopsy line.",

With included instructions and simple templates to guide, a child can quickly create something uniquely their own in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />All Duct Out is a toy that could be used by boys or girls, but it is really intended for creative young lasses. I happen to have two such children in my household and they are the types who would rather make something up with their own hands and creative thoughts than play with something that is pre- designed and always turns out the same way. With this toy, kids have something that, while it does include pre- made shapes and direct instructions, is still great for creative fun because there are several different colors and almost always a different outcome. No two items kids make will be the same, so the creative value of this toy is unmistakable.<br /><br />This toy includes eight, three- yard rolls of duct tape with different colors and patterns. There is enough tape that kids can make each one of the crafts described in the package- a refreshing change compared to other, similar toys. With some crafted toys, there are plenty of choices, but the supplies are limited and kids can only choose a few to make before the supplies run out. With this toy, kids can make everything described in the package and still have duct tape remaining.<br /><br />My girls like this toy and it is fun to watch them select tape and create the different shapes and designs. But one thing I wish was different is the tape itself- it is difficult to cut because it sticks to the blades of a pair of scissors. The included duct tape is not as sticky as real duct tape, but it is still sticky enough and it will stick to your cutting tool. The best you can do is have one person hold the tape and pull it tightly on both ends, to make it rigid before cutting. This makes the process a little easier, but even then, the scissors will likely stick to the tape and the cut will not be clean. No matter how hard you try, you are bound to cut pieces that are not straight edged and looked torn due to the stickiness.  Most kids should be able to tolerate this, but the more perfectionist type kids will find it frustrating.<br /><br />Creative toys are fun for kids and Alex Toys All Duct Out is a fun toy for girls between the ages of five and ten. A better cutting alternative would be nice and my girls voiced their dissatisfaction with having patterns on only two rolls of tape while the rest are solid colors. But they still like this toy overall and they have created some very cool, very girly creations that they still use and play with several weeks later.",

The operation is mechanical so kids can play as long as they want without the worry of batteries dying out.<br /><br />This toy is nice for many reasons and besides the lack of batteries, the toy offers some simple operation and continuous action. All your girl has to do is press the lever, which moves the stairs upward and slowly transfers the small figures and their vehicles to the top of the slide where they glide around and wind up back at the base of the stairs. If you continue to press the lever, it will gradually pick up the next Littlest Pet Shop figure and send it up the stairs to the top of the slide where it will, once again, make its way around the slide to the base of the stairs.<br /><br />My girls like this toy and both they and I find it to our liking. If I had to find some type of fault, it would be the tendency for the small vehicles to sometimes get out of place when they reach the base of the stairs. I haven't witnessed any problems with the vehicles gliding smoothly down the slide- the only problem I notice is that the little vehicles will sometimes get out of place at the stairs, requiring some manual assistance to re- position them. This is most likely to happen if kids get carried away and move the lever too quickly. Keep the speed at a moderate to slow rate, and there shouldn't be any problem.<br /><br />Mechanical toys are nice and even though the Fairly Fun Roller Coaster Set has little or no educational value, it is still a nice toy for girls in the target age group. It is cute, colorful, and provides hours of simple amusement without the need to purchase batteries.",

It has multiple levels, sound effects & lights, and several included accessories for hours of fun.<br /><br />This dollhouse is a little larger than I expected and it does require a small amount of assembly. The majority of the dollhouse is already assembled and ready to go- only a few pieces need manual attachment and a phillips screwdriver is all that is required. The finishing touches involve attaching stickers, so the kids can help with that part. A few small batteries complete the job, and the house is then ready to use.<br /><br />The Fisher Price Loving Family Dream Dollhouse has many fun things to offer and judging by my girls' reaction, the positive points seem to be spread among many things. The sound effects are fun and my girls did get a little carried away at first; pressing the buttons and listening to the sounds over and over again. After a while, much to my relief, they stopped pressing the buttons and settled in for some general play. They decided to use not just the included accessories and family, but also some of their own Barbie dolls for added fun. They made up stories on their own as they moved the dolls and accessories from room to room.<br /><br />The Fisher Price Loving Family Dream Dollhouse is made from plastic but has a solid construction that should last for a long time. The fact that it folds shut is a nice feature because it provides a place in which to store the dolls and accessories. The pieces are small and would otherwise be easy to lose, but this dollhouse is designed to hold everything in place.<br /><br />Looking for some potential negatives aspects of this dollhouse, I can only find a couple and they are minor. One is the fact that there is no built- in handle to pick up the dollhouse and carry it around. However, the large open windows can serve that purpose, so it doesn't really matter. The dollhouse also lacks a kitchen, which is a little unusual, but kids can use their imagination, designate one of the rooms as a kitchen, and even add their own kitchen accessories from other toys. So, once again, the flaw is really too minor to matter. The same could be said of the batteries. Most of us hate having to replace batteries, but the sounds and lights are not essential parts of the toy. Your kids can still have fun and some parents may even opt to leave out the batteries completely.<br /><br />Girls love dollhouses and the Fisher Price Loving Family Dream Dollhouse is a very nice dollhouse from Fisher Price that continues to provide hours of fun for my girls. True, it does surrender to the technological age in a small way by including sounds and lights and it does require batteries, but the electronic enhancements are only slight. There is still plenty of creativity to go around, making the Fisher Price Loving Family Dream Dollhouse a very good toy and one that my girls are going to enjoy for a long time.",

Instead, you just use the included box, which is also made from recycled material, and the pieces will be safe to use for the next adventure.<br /><br />With its lack of batteries, green composition, and creative encouragement, this toy is certainly a nice change from most others, but does it have any possible flaws or potential issues? I can think of only a few. One is the small pieces. They can easily become misplaced, so parents need to watch closely to make sure that kids place all of the pieces back into the box. Of course, the nice fact here is that you can afford to lose a few because, since they are all interchangeable, it won't prevent the toy from being used again and again. Another issue is that this toy could become boring after a while. There are those youngsters who crave action, lights, and sounds in their toys and if yours is one of them, then they may grow tired of the toy in a short time.<br /><br />Recycling is certainly a good idea and creative toys that require imagination and not so much of the lights and sounds so common with kids' toys today are definitely a nice change of pace. Green Toys Build a Bouquet Floral Arrangement Playset is a very nice little toy from Green Toys and it makes a great choice for these reasons. The possible building combinations are endless and while some kids may tire of it in a short time, it still has enough positive qualities and creative entertainment value to make it worth a purchase.",

    "title": "Baby Alive Wanna Walk: She Talks, She Walks, and No Diapers to Change",
    "text": "Baby dolls continue to change each year as manufacturers look for creative enhancements and ways to make the dolls more up to date with modern times. Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk is a good example of these changes in action. She can walk on her own, makes more than forty different statements, responds in ways that are suitable to what is going on around her, and has bilingual ability.<br /><br />The original Baby Alive doll was pioneering because she was the first doll, as far as I know, that could eat food. This doll uses the Baby Alive name, but rather than eat and drink, she shows her realistic abilities by walking and talking. This is not only a nice change from other dolls, it is much more cost effective for parents. One problem with the eating and drinking dolls is that you have to continuously buy food packets and new diapers. There is no such expense with this doll. She devotes her time to walking and talking and about the only necessary maintenance is changing her batteries.<br /><br />Walking and talking isn't anything original, but the manufacturer made a good effort when it created the different sayings and the way the statements are timed to occur at just the right moment. Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk says many different things, but she has many more of them than other dolls and she often times them just right. For example, if she stumbles and falls, she will say things like \"oops, I'm okay.\" If she is ready to take a walk, she will say \"hold on tight\" as she waits for her mommy to take her by the hand. This is more advanced than other talking dolls, most of which make statements at random- statements that have little to do with what is taking place around them.<br /><br />As for the walking, Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk is very good in this area as well. She walks easily across a tile floor or carpet and she makes proud, self- congratulatory remarks as she paces from one part of the room to the next. As long as the carpet isn't too thick, she will have no problem. The best bet is to use a flat rug or tile floor. If she does fall, don't worry- she will make a statement of reassurance to the child, then prepare to try again.<br /><br />Another interesting fact about Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk is her bilingual ability. She talks in both English and Spanish and her language is changed by pressing her belly. You know you did it correctly when she responds in the other language. This is befitting of the times and it is good for those who speak Spanish and want a doll that speaks the same language. But even I Spanish isn't your primary language, the doll is still good as a teaching tool. It can help youngsters learn some of these common phrases in Spanish.<br /><br />Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk is well- constructed and made to last, but bear in mind that this is not the cuddly, stuffed animal replacement that some may think. Since the doll is made for walking, her body isn't soft- it is hard and mechanical. Yes, she will ask your child to hold her and make her feel better, but because her body is made for walking, it isn't cuddly and snuggly. My girls don't seem to mind- they know this doll has one purpose and other dolls have a different purpose. But it is still something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Girls love their dolls and Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk is a very good child's doll from Hasbro with unique qualities that make her different from her closest competitors. My girls have told me she is beautiful and fun, and they look forward to each walking and talking experience.",

    "title": "Root Vue Farm: Little Value and Several Flaws",
    "text": "Root Vue Farm is a child's toy designed to educate kids on one of the wonders of nature. It is planting device that allows children a chance to watch vegetables grow and see what they look like below the surface of the ground.<br /><br />When I purchased Root Vue Farm, I intended it to be a good educational lesson and in some ways, it does offer some educational value. It succeeds at getting kids to think more about plants and from a different perspective than usual. Kids and adults are all accustomed to looking at plants above the ground, but not below the surface where the edible parts of many vegetables are found. In this regard, Root Vue Farm is a good addition to a child's toy chest and it seemed like a good purchase.<br /><br />The problems with Root Vue Farm, however, become evident when you put it together and plant the seeds. Taking it from the box, the first thing I didn't like was the construction. It is very cheaply made, using styrofoam to form the box that holds the soil and seeds. There is an acrylic viewing window, which is fine, but I couldn't believe the manufacturer made the main part of the toy from styrofoam. The use of plastic would have been better, but it appears the manufacturer was trying to cut costs in any way possible.<br /><br />Next, we added the seeds and soil, watered it down, and waited for the seeds to grow. The first problem we encountered was with mold. The excessive moisture leads to mold growth and since the farm is made from styrofoam, you cannot easily keep it clean. At least with a plastic box, the mold could be wiped off. But you cannot clean this very easily and it stinks.<br /><br />Waiting for the seeds to sprout also proved frustrating. The seeds do sprout in a matter of days, but they did not reach the point where the vegetables could be viewed through the viewing window. I also noticed weed- like growth on the top of the soil. I don't know where it came from, but there it was, covering the top of the soil.<br /><br />Educational toys are great and the concept of growing vegetables and observing their growth progress and root network still has some appeal. I may look for another toy with the same concept and better construction, but I will not bother with Root Vue Farm again. Nasty mold growth, styrofoam, and other annoyances make this an educational experience to forget.",

    "title": "Fun, Easy to Use Toy with Lots of Action",
    "text": "Kids love their toys and the ones they seem to love best are those that feature action of some sort. It could be sound, lights, or movement- whichever action is available makes the toy that much better in the eyes of a child.  The Koosh Galaxy Solar Recon Launcher offers all three: Sound, light, and action and for this reason alone, most kids are sure to enjoy it.<br /><br />First, let's look at the facts. The Koosh Galaxy Solar Recon Launcher is a plastic, battery operated toy that holds four small, glow in the dark balls. The device can then be used to fire the balls out, one at a time, by pulling back on the front stock. With each launch, the device responds with sound and lights, for added fun.<br /><br />The Koosh Galaxy Solar Recon Launcher has many qualities that make it a better than average toy. From an adult perspective, I like that the four balls are soft and therefore not capable of damaging anything. I also like that the launcher can be used without the batteries. If you don't want to add batteries or if your batteries have gone dead, you can still use the launcher- it just won't have the sounds or lights. It is nice to have this option that frees parents from having to constantly replace batteries and I wish more toys were made this way, when possible.<br /><br />Kids like this toy for its action- oriented design, lights, and sound and because the small balls are so light and safe, families with two or more kids might consider buying multiple launchers and letting their kids create their own games as they fire the balls back and forth. The balls are large enough that they are more difficult to lose and are soft enough that they won't hurt anyone- not even the most sensitive child's skin.<br /><br />The Koosh Galaxy Solar Recon Launcher requires a steady hand and a good aim and it has proven itself a fun toy. Very young children may have trouble firing the launcher but as long as your kids are at least four or older, they should have no problem operating this toy and enjoying hours of simple fun.",

    "text": "Ravensburger Mandala Designer Ballerina is a fun toy for young artists. It comes with two stencils and can be used to create all sorts of different patterns and designs with a small amount of skill and some patience.<br /><br />My girls love art and they took to this artistic device immediately. They are both young and they like using a stencil because it makes it easy to produce nice, neat designs. Kids can fill in different shapes on the stencil and make a varied work of art or concentrate on one item, rotate the stencil, and continue to create the same design to create a circular pattern. Kids can do what they like- there is no right or wrong answer with an artistic toy such as this.<br /><br />If there were any negative points to bring up with this toy, it would be the lack of more stencils and the irregular paper size. There are only two stencils, and this could be limiting to some kids. In addition, some adults will be annoyed with the paper because it isn't a standard size and thus requires cutting paper to the right size.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is still a good artistic toy and the proof is the fact that my girls continue to use it long after their first encounter. It isn't anything complex or amazing, but it is fun and is priced low enough to make it worth considering for the budding young artist in your home.",

    "title": "Offers some fun, but also some frustration",
    "text": "If your kids like art the way mine do, then you know that they will jump at most any chance to express themselves artistically or to take part in any activity where art is an important component. That most assuredly includes art related toys and this is what led me to obtain the Deco Mandala Designer Drawing Machine.<br /><br />This drawing machine is actually simpler and less complex then it first appears. It is really nothing more than a stencil apparatus complete with a base that holds the stencil and paper in place for better drawing. You just slip one of the included square sheets of paper through the narrow opening, place one of the stencils on top, and then lock the stencil in place. Kids can then fill in the designs on the stencil with the included pencil and then press the button to turn the paper so that the same design can be drawn in another position.<br /><br />Among the qualities I like about this drawing machine, one is the rotating feature. I like that it rotates at precise angles so that kids can evenly space their design on a piece of paper, for a nicer presentation. The clips hold the stencil in place very well so there is no slipping and each stencil has enough design options to keep young artists happy. And the included butterfly stamp and punch help add to the artistic qualities of the finished product.<br /><br />One quality I am not too thrilled with is the insertion of paper. You have to push the paper through the slot and it isn't easy to get it just right. It would work better if the top could be opened and the paper laid down, but it cannot. You have to push it through and that means that some of our budding artists will not push it far enough, resulting in a design that isn't centered on the paper. I also do not know why the device had to be manufactured in such a way that it needs four AA batteries. The only necessary power is to rotate the base and it would seem like this could have been accomplished with less battery power.<br /><br />This drawing machine comes complete with about ten square sheets of paper. Once you run out- which will not take long- you will have to cut your own paper because the square sheets are not standard in size. Another issue I have is with the stencil itself. The openings are very narrow, which means you cannot use crayons and most other writing utensils. You have to use something with a very long, narrow tip, and that means potentially a trip to an art supply shop to purchase more supplies.<br /><br />My girls love art and they like this drawing machine, but not quite as much as they first thought. It is still a good toy for the encouragement of creativity, but the manufacturer could have made it better with a few small changes.",

    "text": "Kids often like toys best that offer movement of some kind. Flashing lights and sounds also have a certain appeal, but at the very least there needs to be some type of moving action. Furreal Friends Dizzy Dancers is a toy that offers some action and many youngsters will take to this toy right away once they learn how it works.<br /><br />Furreal Friends Dizzy Dancers includes one pink and one purple bunny. To get the dancers dancing, all you do is insert one of the plastic slides into the bunny, then pull it out quickly. This gets the pointer on the base spinning fast. Like a top, you then place it on a smooth, flat surface and let it spin. The toy offers Mechanical operation, so no batteries are needed.<br /><br />Furreal Friends Dizzy Dancers are action- oriented and I was surprised by how long the dancers continue to spin like a top after a single pull from the plastic slide. Provided you pull the slide out quickly, the dancers will continue spinning for a while. One game my kids like is to spin both of them at the same time, then sit back and see whose bunny is spinning the longest. They have come up with a few other creative games also, and this surprised me a little at first because the toy seems so simple.<br /><br />My girls find this toy amusing, but one thing I noticed is that, unlike their other toys, Furreal Friends Dizzy Dancers has little staying power. That is, the spinning just isn't enough to keep my kids interested for long. At first, it seemed like fun watching the bunnies spin and making up games but after the first week, their interest had tapered off considerably. The simplicity of the toy is nice and I am grateful that it takes no batteries, but after one week, the bunnies have already been relegated to the bottom of the toy box.<br /><br />Kids like toys that move, but apparently a toy that spins and does little else just doesn't have enough action to matter. I still find the Furreal Friends Dizzy Dancers good enough to recommend a little, but I can understand why some people will rate this toy below average. Kids love it at first, but their interest falls rapidly once they realize how little these bunnies can actually do.",

    "text": "Kids love to color, so a toy like the Crayola Crayon Maker would seem like an ideal addition to any home with children under the age of eight. Coloring with your child's own crayons he/she just made would seem like a great creative addition to an already fun activity.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fun with this toy stops at the concept itself. Making crayons is a great idea, but this device has several issues that prevent it from living up to its potential. The way it works is simple enough- you place the crayon material on a tray and set a timer. The heat from the lightbulb melts the crayons, which are then poured into a mold. You then wait for them to cool and they are ready to use. This sounds simple, but there are all sorts of problems along the way, and many of them seem to stem from Crayola's desire to apparently make the crayon maker as safe as possible.<br /><br />One issue is with the locking mechanism. As you move from one step to the next, the device locks itself and you cannot unlock until the cycle is completed. For example, when the crayons are transferred to the molds, there is no way to unlock at this point. You are forced to wait for the crayons to cool before you can open. Issues with the timer are similarly frustrating- if your child accidentally sets the timer prematurely, you have no choice but to wait until it is finished. You cannot move the timer forward. You have to wait for it to complete its cycle.<br /><br />Another issue I have is with the melting phase. There is no buzzer or anything to tell you that the crayons are ready to transfer to the molds. Thus, you have to pay close attention and make sure you are there, when the light bulb goes off, ready to transfer. If you don't act promptly, the crayons will cool off and solidify in the tray.<br /><br />These frustrations might be tolerable enough for more patient types, but there is one ultimate frustration is enough to make you want to give up and ask for a refund. I am referring to the amount of crayons included in each package. You get only enough to make two crayons! You heard me correctly- two small crayons! When you consider what you have to go through just to get a pair of crayons and when you consider how inexpensive crayons are, it makes you wonder why you even bothered to obtain this device in the first place.<br /><br />Making crayons can be fun and there are many ways to make them using ordinary household heat sources, utensils, etc. I recommend making crayons the old fashioned way and skipping the Crayola Crayon Maker completely. It is a good idea gone bad and I can only hope that Crayola has a new and improved version in the making.",

    "text": "Kids love electronics, but parents are often rightfully concerned that the electronic gadgets their kids play with may not be very educational, not even in the sense of encouraging even the basic skills. There are, however, many electronic toys that do stimulate learning and the Leapster 2 is certainly one of them. It is all about learning and it teaches kids between the ages of three and eight a multitude of useful skills.<br /><br />So what exactly is the Leapster 2? It is a handheld device made with learning in mind. It fits easily between a pair of small hands and, depending on the cartridge you insert, it can help children will all sorts of basic skills from math to general problem solving and beyond. Kids love using it and the cool thing is that they learn without realizing it. In other words, they have so much fun playing the different games that they don't even realize they are playing with a learning/educational device. If you think about it, it's a winning situation all around.<br /><br />The Leapster 2 bundle is similar to other Leapster products on the market, at least in terms of the actual electronic device. But with this offering, consumers get a few extras, including a game (Outwit), carrying case, and an ac adapter. All are nice extras, but the one I particularly like is the adapter. Considering how much my girls use this and other electronic devices, it makes no sense (and can get very frustrating) to continue to make special trips to the store to buy batteries. The adapter makes life easy and guarantees continuous play as long as an electrical outlet is within reach.<br /><br />Leapster 2 isn't an amazing gaming system, but isn't really intended to be. The processor doesn't move at a very high speed and the graphics are not incredible. But kids in the targeted age group are not likely to notice or care. They will love their Leapster 2 and will enjoy playing the games, testing their current skills, and learning new ones. Parents will love the educational value as well and will likely purchase more cartridges for future play and new learning experiences.<br /><br />When all things are considered, you really cannot go wrong with an electronic device such as this and it's no surprise that Leapster 2 has such a large following and has earned so much praise from educators, kids, and parents. Buy one for your youngster and see for yourself how much fun learning can be.",

Flashing lights would require batteries, which some may not like, but sound effects could be added without the need for batteries. The added sound of a honking horn, a motor starting up, flushing toilet, or something would make the toy more appealing to the average kid, most of whom still want something that appeals to the different senses.<br /><br />Girls love dolls and the Fisher Price Loving Family Beach Vacation Mobile Home is a good toy for young girls who want a new way to display and play with their assortment of dolls. There are no sounds or lights and no actual family of dolls included, but the toy does offer a fold- out interior house and several accessories that are good for hours of entertainment.",

Lift Pinkie Pie by the hand and pretend to help her walk and she will respond with: Look, I can walk! Pretend to feed her and she will say: More please. She says other phrases, too, like I Love You Mommy and Excuse Me. The phrases are stated at random and each one is activated by lifting the hand. However, make sure you don't leave the toy Try mode because if you do, it will talk whenever someone passes by. Turn the control to the On position and it will only talk when the hand is moved.<br /><br />My Little Pony Pinkie Pie is made from plastic and that makes the toy basically unbreakable. It can be dropped, thrown, etc., without worry. The toy comes complete with the My Little Pony Pinkie Pie doll, a bottle, pacifier, bowl, and spoon. The added accessories are great for the young mommies in your house who will enjoy playing with, feeding, and taking care of their little friend. The doll is light so children of most any age can easily lift it and carry it around. And the doll is very cute and babyish in appearance, which will add to its appeal to the young ones in the home.<br /><br />My Little Pony So Soft Pinkie Pie is a hit with both of my young girls and they rate it as an enjoyable toy. They may not rank it in their top five, but they still like this toy and have not grown tired of it since it was introduced in our home several weeks ago.",

    "title": "Connect Four Launchers: New Variation on an Old Favorite",
    "text": "Connect Four Launchers is a new variation on a classic game many of us have been playing for decades. The look and construction are different, but the  concept is still the same: Players must connect four in a row, either across, up and down, or diagonally to win.<br /><br />What sets Connect Four Launchers apart from the classic version is that here, the checkers are not dropped, they are launched through the air using a plastic launching device. There are two levels for which to aim and the goal is to have the checkers land in a row, inside the divots. Get four of them in a row before your opponent, and you win.<br /><br />Most everyone has played original Connect Four and most remember it as a game of strategy with a little luck. Connect Four Launchers is a little lower on the strategy and higher on the skill because to win at Connect Four Launchers, you have to be able to aim and fire your checker just right in order to land in the desired space. With practice, you may be able to get it right, but you never know when you launch where your checker will land. This in direct contrast to regular Connect Four, where you knew where your checker was going to end up before it was even dropped.<br /><br />This game offers different ways to play and youngsters will likely take to it right away. Some kids may need a little guidance at first so that they learn exactly how to launch the checkers. When my little ones first played this game, they tended to pull the lever too far and lauch too hard, sending their checkers flying over the game board and onto the floor. It takes some practice, but in time, most anyone should be able to play the game as intended.<br /><br />I liked the original Connect Four and I like this alternative as well, but for different reasons. This game can get a little frustrating because unlike regular Connect Four, with the Launchers version, you can block an opponent by landing one of your checkers on top of theirs. This means there is a good chance that no one will win when the checkers run out. But Connect Four Launchers is still a fun variation on the classic game with more action and more entertainment that most families will find to their liking.",

    "text": "Kids like to do grown- up things and the Vtech Kidizoom Digital Camera allows them to do just that. This is a fully- functioning camera specifically designed for the needs and desires of youngsters and it allows kids to take pictures, edit them in fun ways, and even upload them to a computer for further viewing and editing.<br /><br />Many qualities make this camera one to consider and the first is the memory. This is sold as a child's camera, but it has a surprisingly high level of memory and is capable of holding up to 400 pictures! This is much better than I expected and with this much memory, it will take a long time before kids exceed the available space. They can walk around the house ansd snap picture after picture without worrying that the memory will fill.<br /><br />Another positive aspect with the Vtech Kidizoom Digital Camera is its durability. This camera is made from plastic with a rubberized edge that makes it easy to hold and highly resistant to breakage. My girls have dropped it several times and it continues to work regardless. It is also very entertaining. Not only can kids take their own pictures of mom, dad, the family dog, and their friends, but they can also add to the fun by using the editing feature. The silly editing  allows kids a chance to take an ordinary picture and make it look funny.<br /><br />So, the Vtech Kidizoom Digital Camera is fun for kids, but are there any cons? Well, there are a few but they are minor enough to overlook. One is the viewing screen on the back of the camera. It is quite small and some images will be barely perceptible. It would be completely unacceptable to adults, but kids will likely find it perfectly fine. Then, one has to consider the picture quality. This camera has only 0.3 megapixels and that means the clarity of the pictures is well below average. Once again, kids are not likely to care. They will so enjoy having their own camera and taking their own pictures that they won't even notice or mind the fuzzy images.<br /><br />Kids like to mimic adults and the Vtech Kidizoom Digital Camera is likely to be a hit with most youngsters for this and other reasons. As I said, the clarity of the photos isn't the best and the camera does have a few other minor flaws, but none of this will matter to most children. The ability to take their own pictures, edit them in fun ways, and even view them on a computer will be more than enough to please the young camerabug in your home.",

    "title": "How Much do Your Kids Know about Money?",
    "text": "Money Savvy Pig offers a fun and effective way to teach kids about money and its many important uses. Parents devote very little time to the concept of financial management, in spite of its critical nature, often because they are not sure how best to approach the subject. Money Savvy Pig makes it easy to introduce youngsters to these important concepts.<br /><br />How does Money Savvy Pig work as an educational device? The answer is simple. By including four different chambers with different labels- one for spend, one for save, one for donate, and one for invest- kids gain a sense of financial management and money allocation. They learn that money has uses that go far beyond ordinary spending. Kids under the age of seven are not ready to learn the specifics of these different concepts, but early exposure is a good idea and the Money Savvy Bank Pig certainly succeeds in this respect.<br /><br />The Money Savvy Bank is made from plastic and mine has held up fine thus far. Others have pointed out that this bank can break if dropped on a hard surface. Considering its lightweight design, it isn't difficult to imagine the bank breaking apart if mishandled, which is why parents need to exercise caution and make sure their kids handle the bank with extra care when moving from one place to the next.<br /><br />I like that this bank separates money into four different sections and I like that it gets kids thinking about money and its uses. One limitation, however, is that this bank isn't very good for storing paper money. The reason is because the pieces of paper are difficult to remove. The openings on the bottom of the bank are small- too small to stick your hand inside the bank to remove paper. Place a folded dollar bill inside this bank and it will take some shaking and maneuvering to remove it from the bottom. Thus, this bank should be avoided for storing paper currency. It is intended for use with coins.<br /><br />Financial literacy is important and kids need to learn about money at the youngest age possible. The Money Savvy Pig is a very good piggy bank for youngsters and its benefits go far beyond the encouragement of savings. It encourages kids to ask questions and think about money in different ways, making it a great choice for a child's early financial education.",

This stamp kit comes complete with nine different stamps, a small ink pad with pink and purple ink, and five colored pencils for your child's creative enjoyment.<br /><br />Melissa and Doug toys are known for education, creativity, and durability and most every product the company makes can be counted on to posses at least two of these qualities. The same is true with this toy. The Melissa and Doug Princess Wooden Stamp Set isn't big on educational quality, but it does encourage creativity and the set and storage container are made from wood, for better durability. The wooden container offers easy storage so that pieces do not get lost and the product's individual pieces are designed to last.<br /><br />Melissa and Doug Princess Wooden Stamp Set is simple yet fun and requires little supervision or explaining. My little princesses like this toy and still find it fun, but I have noticed that it lacks the staying power of some of their favorite toys. Unless I suggest it, they are not likely to use it. They do like it, but I think they have become a little bored with it. They prefer toys with movement and sound, and this offers neither.<br /><br />This stamp set is certainly durable, but one thing that isn't made to last is the ink pad. I like that the Melissa and Doug Princess Wooden Stamp Set comes complete with its own ink and my girls strongly appreciate that the ink is colored purple and pink. However, don't expect the ink to last very long. The small blotches of ink will not offer many stamping adventures, so be prepared to purchase additional ink stamps within a few months.<br /><br />Although not the perfect toy, the Melissa and Doug Princess Wooden Stamp Set is nonetheless a good toy for little princesses everywhere. It has many positive qualities, encourages creativity, and is priced right. Like I said, it lacks staying power, but it has enough positive qualities to recommend.",

My girls like both of the options, but they tend toward the princess set of accessories. The tutu, slippers, and crown are their favorites, but they like the other items as well. Having two sets in a single package is good for those with two kids because it means that both can have fun without fighting over who gets to enjoy the dress up set. There are items for two, so both are satisfied.<br /><br />This dress- up role play set can be fun and most girls will like it, but I do have a few issues with this dress up set and the main one is that there are simply not many items included. The trunk is small, and it surprised me when I saw it for the first time. Upon opening the trunk, I noticed that the small size made sense, given the small size of the included items. There are no actual clothing sets with this role play kit. The tutu is the closest item to an actual piece of clothing, but it is still very limited. The lack of complete outfits will frustrate some children and parents alike who purchase this expecting something more.<br /><br />My girls enjoy the Olivia television program and they like to play dress up, but they are only lukewarm about the Olivia Dream It, Be It Role Play Set. The items are quite small and there are only a few of them, so don't buy this expecting something incredible. Add a few more clothing items and the set would be much better, but considering its low price, it isn't too bad and it has just enough good qualities to award it with a small recommendation.",

This map is made from heavy, thick cardboard and it features individual pieces for most but not all of the U.S. states. Once assembled, it measures two feet by three feet and it offers youngsters a challenge as they try to place each state in its proper place.<br /><br />Education is the name of the game with the Melissa and Doug USA Map Floor Puzzle. Not only do kids get to learn about geography, they also get to learn about each U.S. state in other important ways. To add to the educational experience, Melissa and Doug decided to include the capital of each state and a small illustration of something unique to each state. The small illustration is especially useful because it teaches kids where to place the pieces, thereby helping them learn where each state is located. For example, most youngsters will not know where the state of Washington is located, but a quick glance at the box lets kids know that Washington is the state known for apples. All they have to do at that point is find the piece with the depiction of apples, then place it in the upper left corner of the puzzle.<br /><br />One fact about the Melissa and Doug USA Map Floor Puzzle that might bother some parents and kids is the tendency of the pieces to slide around. They do not interlock, and thus they tend to move around as the puzzle is assembled. I know that some people have criticized the puzzle for this reason, but I find it okay in this instance because it keeps the pieces/states true to form. If the puzzle pieces were interlocking, the individual pieces would not form the shape of a specific state, and it would interfere slightly with the learning experience.<br /><br />Educational toys are great and the Melissa and Doug USA Map Floor Puzzle is certainly a toy that helps kids learn: About geography, about state capitals, and about state trivia. It is true that the pieces tend to slide around and this could lead to frustration, but this is still a fun toy nonetheless that will satisfy most children and parents alike.",

This child's toy features Princess Belle from Beauty and the Beast and it provides young princesses with a means to enjoy a full- fledged tea party as they wheel the tea cart from one room to the next.<br /><br />My girls love the Disney Princesses so they took a natural liking to this toy. They enjoy pushing the cart from room to room and they like using their imaginations as they make up stories and share cups of tea with imaginary friends. The tea cart is based on Princess Belle and Beauty and the Beast, but unless you look really closely at the small depictions of Princess Belle, the cart looks just like any other Disney product. This makes it a good choice for young Disney fans everywhere.<br /><br />From a parent's perspective, this tea cart is certainly cute and very easy to assemble, but I do have some small issues with the design. The main problem I have is with the tray. It rests on the top of the cart and is held very loosely in place. I realize it needs to be a little bit loose so that kids can remove the tray for their tea parties, but it needs to be more secure than this. Another problem is lack of storage. The accessories that come with this tea cart are small and there is no place to put them except on the serving tray. A lower tray or some other storage facility would have been a big improvement.<br /><br />Besides the cuteness factor, there is one other quality with this tea cart that greatly adds to its appeal- it doesn't make any noise! So many toys nowadays include sound effects, clicking sounds, etc., but the Disney Princess Belle Beauty and the Beast Tea Cart has nothing like this. There are no batteries and thus no sound effects. This tea cart is fueled by human efforts only, both in the physical sense and in the imagination sense.<br /><br />Disney princesses are a huge money generation tool for the company, in both movies and in merchandise and this tea cart is certainly a fun piece of merchandise to add to your child's gift list. It has a few small flaws, but they are minor compared to the positive points and they take little away from the toy's overall value.",

The kit comes complete with cutters, rolling pin, measuring spoons, and other necessities so that your child can create dessert treats, just like a grown- up.<br /><br />My girls love this kit and they were anxious to use it when it arrived at my front door. They enjoyed mixing up the cakes and creating special treats for their (and supposedly my) enjoyment. They had a good deal of fun watching and waiting as their treats emerged from the microwave, ready to consume.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the young ones in your home will love this kit and will rate it as one of their favorites. But from an adult perspective, there are some problems with this product. The greatest problem is the same one many others in this forum have stated, and that is the taste of the food. It is nasty, to say the least, and the mixes are loaded with artificial ingredients. Little ones don't seem to mind the taste so much, but adults will have a hard time keeping a straight face as they consume the cakes and tell their children what a great job they did.<br /><br />Are there other problems? Yes, among them the tiny pieces and cleaning them. There is no easy way to store the small pieces (the kit doesn't come with a storage box), so you will need to find our own storage method. We place ours in a large, plastic container for future use. The pieces take careful effort to clean, too. They need to be washed by hand (cannot place in dishwasher), but reaching into the small grooves takes, well, the small fingers of a child in order to reach.<br /><br />So, how to I rate the Easy Bake Microwave and Style Deluxe Kit? Well, it isn't anything like the Easy Bake products I remember my sisters using as a child and the included mixes create food that is barely edible. In spite of these cons, however, I have to give this product an average rating overall because it encourages fun and family togetherness. Regardless of what I think, my girls love it and will likely use it again. The large smiles it produces and the endless fun and creativity it inspires make this a product worth considering- barely.",

    "text": "Monopoly Junior is a scaled- down version of the classic board game that has been entertaining teenagers and adults for more than seven decades. This version of Monopoly is designed with kids in mind; complete with smaller denominations of currency, colored tokens, a shorter board, fewer rules, and shorter playing time.<br /><br />Monopoly Junior is similar to regular Monopoly in its basic layout, but there are many changes that make the game an experience all of its own. Events like going to jail do not exist in Monopoly Junior. Instead, you go to lunch. Taking a free ride replaces free parking and instead of collecting outlandish fees when someone stays at the hotel on your property, you setup ticket booths and collect money when an opponent stops at your booth. And unlike regular Monopoly, players do not have the option to make a purchase- they have to buy whatever they land on. There is no borrowing money in this version of the game and because of this, as soon as a player runs out of money, the game is over.<br /><br />Monopoly Junior is useful as a warm- up to learning about and playing the adult version, but it has other positive qualities as well. For one, it teaches kids about money: how to count it, and how to make change. It also teaches kids how to count spaces, follow rules, and cooperate with others by paying what is due. All of these qualities- along with learning about money- are good reasons to introduce Monopoly Junior to your elementary school- age child.<br /><br />I like most aspects of Monopoly Junior and it rates as a very good family game, but it does have a few drawbacks. One is the small game pieces. They are very easy to lose and represent a choking hazard for small children. Another small issue I have with this Monopoly version is the lack of much interaction by the banker. Having a more involved banker would help teach children how to count money and make change more quickly. Players are constantly trading money back and forth, but there isn't much interaction with the banker. Having a more active banker would help teach youngsters even more about this profession and what it involves.<br /><br />Still, in spite of the few issues I have with this game, Monopoly Junior is a fun family game with many benefits. It is useful both as a learning tool and as a means to prepare children for the future when they play regular Monopoly with friends and family. The game is solid overall and it makes a great choice for family game night with younger children.",

    "title": "Hands- On Educational Experience, and Kid's Love It!",
    "text": "The Live Butterfly Garden by Insect Lore is a fun, hands- on educational experience that is certain to appeal to even the most stubborn, disinterested child. With the Live Butterfly Garden, children get to observe the process of metamorphosis, right before their eyes. Starting with caterpillars, children watch the little critters eat food, create a cocoon, and then transform into fully grown adult butterflies. The butterflies can then be observed in their habitat for a while before setting free.<br /><br />This butterfly garden is great for dozens of reasons, the most obvious of which is the educational value. Reading about insects and metamorphosis is one thing, but seeing the process live is another thing entirely. Kids get to learn how caterpillars/butterflies live, eat, and thrive; how to care for them; etc. They get to observe the caterpillars and butterflies at play and watch the butterflies eat their food, which is provided in the package. The caterpillars that come with the Live Butterfly Garden are painted ladies, which are not very common and will not be recognized by most children. However, most kids won't care- the fun of watching these small caterpillars transform into butterflies will have many kids gazing in awe, and prompt them to ask many questions.<br /><br />This educational toy is a huge hit and my kids loved it, but there were a few small issues. One was waiting for the caterpillars to arrive in the mail. To get the caterpillars, you have to mail in an included certificate, along with a check, and then wait. It seems like an eternity, especially from the perspective of young children, and it took longer than expected. Anther problem was parting with the butterflies. Once you have the caterpillars and they have transformed into adult butterflies, the next problem will be setting them free. Kids will grow attached to their small, winged friends and will not want to let them go. Another minor issue is with the transferring of the caterpillars from their small container- the one you receive in the mail- into the actual habitat. The container that the caterpillars arrive in has a paper area at the top, where the caterpillars will hang as they spin their cocoons. This paper section is fairly easy to remove, but the problem is that the cocoons are very delicately attached, and that means that some will fall off when the transfer is made. You will need to pin this piece of paper to the inside of the butterfly garden, but the kit doesn't include any pins. Safety pins or straight pins work, and it would have been nice if these were included in the kit.<br /><br />Still, when all factors are considered, the Live Butterfly Garden is worth the purchase and young children will enjoy the educational experience. Sure, it could be improved a little bit by making a few minor changes, but this is still a very good toy and considering my kid's fascination with the process, along with the educational value, it earns an easy recommendation.",

    "text": "The 3D Solar System Kit by Toysmith is a good educational/learning tool that introduces children to the world of astronomy. This planetary system includes spheres representing the eight planets and the sun, sized in relative order (not to scale). It hangs from the ceiling as a mobile unit and includes special glow in the dark paint for added fun.<br /><br />This solar system kit comes completely unassembled and part of the enjoyment for youngsters is the application of the paint. There are two strips of paint included with several different colors. This allows kids the chance to explore their creative side. Some kids will choose to paint the planets according to their actual color, such as painting the planet Mars red. Others will mix and match and create all sorts of different color combinations. Kids will enjoy this part of the process almost as much as they will enjoy looking at the completed mobile itself.<br /><br />Once the fun of painting is over, it will then be time to assemble the pieces together. This is easily the most frustrating part of the process and depending on the ages of your kids, you may very well have to complete this step for them. The reason this is so frustrating is because of the very small size of the hooks and the rectangular pieces that are anchored into the spheres. The tiny hooks and even tinier rectangular pieces have a small hole in the middle through which you have to thread the fishing line. This takes time and patience and you have to tie the ends securely enough that the line won't come loose. A single knot isn't good enough. You need to make two knots if you want the line to stay in place. The pieces are so tiny, many young children will be unable to complete the task and even many adults will grow frustrated. The manufacturer should rethink this aspect and, if nothing else, increase the size of these pieces, in order to make them easier to work with.<br /><br />Another possible trouble spot with this solar system module is the fragility of the pieces. The mobile looks interesting hanging from the ceiling and its lightweight design means it will slowly turn, with the slightest amount of air. However, because the pieces are so light and fragile, you have to keep the mobile away from wind/air sources. The air movement from a fan, for example, could be enough to make the planetary bodies come apart and/or cause the nylon string to become untied. Even the air movement from a heat duct could be enough to cause problems. It's best to place the mobile far out of the reach of small children. If little ones can easily touch the mobile, the constant handling will cause the pieces to fall apart.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the 3D Solar System Kit by Toysmith is still good educational toy for kids that introduces them to the world of astronomy. Assembling the tiny pieces can really try your patience and the fragile nature of this mobile solar system limits its quality. However, it still has enough positive points to earn a slight recommendation.",

    "title": "Woodtsock Fantasy Guitar: No Casualties.....Yet",
    "text": "Woodstock Percussion Kid's Fantasy Guitar is a small, six- string guitar designed to entertain youngsters as they exercise their creative abilities. It is a good starting guitar for youngsters and it includes a few extras, such as a pick, additional string, and instruction booklet.<br /><br />This children's guitar is manufactured for young musicians in the making. It is small in size and easily fits in the hands of children. It is also very light weight so that children can easily hold it in place and play it without strain. It provides a means to make a little noise and create songs, making it a good choice as a creative outlet.<br /><br />Like I said, this guitar is very light weight in construction. It is so light, in fact, that I immediately began to question the guitar's durability. The construction is comprised of very thin pieces of wood and other materials and while nothing has happened since I purchased this guitar a few months ago, it seems like only a matter of time until something breaks.<br /><br />As for making music, this product does have some good things to offer. It creates a pleasant sound and kids will enjoy strumming the strings as they make up songs. Another nice factor is that the sound isn't very loud. One potential problem for some parents is that the strings cannot be tuned to the proper pitch. This instrument has the standard six strings, frets, and tuning knobs, etc., just like those of a standard guitar, but the strings can only be made to approximate the proper pitch. This won't matter to the vast majority of parents and I would say it is safe to assume that kids will not care either. But serious parental musicians may not like this.<br /><br />Of all the features of this guitar, the one that annoys me the most is the tendency of the strings to loosen. With ordinary usage, the strings slowly loosen up, regardless of whether or not the knobs have been touched. At first, I thought my girls were playing around with the knobs, but quick observation proved this was not the case. The strings just naturally loosen up, with regular usage.<br /><br />So, how does this children's guitar measure up overall? Well, it seems sufficient for its intended use and children will find it entertaining. On the other hand, its construction isn't very solid and the strings gradually loosen, even after a few minutes of use. Thus, considering all pros and cons, I'm going to give it an average rating overall. It hasn't broken or failed us yet, but it seems like a matter of time before it self- destructs and the field of pros and cons are basically equal.",

    "title": "Nice Toy, but Microscopic Accessories Can Cause Problems",
    "text": "My girls are big fans of the Strawberry Shortcake character so it makes sense that they would like toys, dvds and other things with this characters likeness.  I felt pretty confident that they would take a liking to this toy and, sure enough, they have found many things to like about the Strawberry Shortcake Berry Café. First, they love dollhouses and this toy is shaped like a dollhouse. Second, they like the accessories and the attached bird on the top of the toy. The bird is the only part of the toy that moves. It is a wind- up toy and all you do is press it down and release. The bird then spins around a few times as it unwinds in an upward direction.<br /><br />From the viewpoint of a little girl, this toy is fun and I'm not at all surprised that my girls find it enjoyable. However, from the perspective of a parent, many things about this toy need to be improved. The most obvious is the accessories. The inclusion of accessories is nice because you don't need to make a separate purchase, but the problem with the Strawberry Shortcake Berry Café is that the accessories are far too small. Most anyone who examines this toy will come away with the same conclusion. Some of the accessories are so small, they will most certainly become lost in due time. I realize the Strawberry Shortcake Berry Café isn't very large, but the manufacturer should have made the accessories a little larger and included fewer of them.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me about this toy is that is doesn't close up. It is shaped like half of a strawberry, designed like a dollhouse, but without a second side to fold shut. This means there is no way to close it up, to protect the small accessories from getting lost. Again, this is an obvious oversight from the manufacturer. Tiny accessories could be tolerated if they could be locked inside the toy, but they cannot.<br /><br />Looking for some good things to say about the Strawberry Shortcake Berry Café, it is a very colorful toy, with bright, cheery shades of red, green, and other colors. And while I have made my complaints about the size of the accessories, I will be the first to admit that they are made with fine craftsmanship-  painted in multiple colors, making them look nice, and authentic. Also, this toy does encourage kids to use their imagination. Because there are no sounds or motorized parts, children are encouraged to make up stories as they play- a nice change from the majority of toys that features sounds, lights, and automatic, battery- powered movement.<br /><br />So, when all things are considered, Strawberry Shortcake Berry Café is a good toy that could have been much better with a few changes. My girls like it because they like the character and while I can agree that the accessories are nicely made, they are far too small and are quickly lost. Add everything together and you have a toy that I find acceptable, but with reservations.",

    "text": "The Melissa and Doug Wooden Shape Sorting Clock is an educational toy in the shape of a clock, made from wood, with small wooden sorting blocks that fit into designated spaces. This toy helps to teach kids how to tell time and match shapes and it makes a great toy option for youngsters in the preschool age group.<br /><br />Educational toys are the preferred toy from a parental point of view, but it is sometimes a challenge to find an educational toy that my girls will enjoy for an extended period of time. With the Melissa and Doug Wooden Shape Sorting Clock, it appears I have achieved victory in this area. Even weeks after their initial encounter with this toy, my girls still enjoying sorting the blocks and reading the numbers on the clock dial. Each of the blocks is colored differently and shaped differently and my girls enjoying figuring out which block fits into which slot.<br /><br />One of the many advantages with the Melissa and Doug Wooden Shape Sorting Clock is its ability to educate in multiple ways. Not only does it teach kids spatial skills and how to tell time, it also teaches kids how to match numbers, count the minutes and hours, and arrange the hands of the clock to a certain time. With the blocks, younger children will have two ways to match: By shape or by number. If they cannot match the number, they can match the shape that fits, thus eliminating frustration and eventually learning the number in the process. Yet another advantage of this toy is that it encourages more imaginative play. There are no bells or whistles and no batteries. The hands of the clock are moved only by pushing with the fingers. These facts make the Melissa and Doug Wooden Shape Sorting Clock a little on the old- fashioned side, in a sense, but in a positive way.<br /><br />Educational toys are the best but it is often a challenge to find an educational toy that children will enjoy. This toy has passed the test with flying colors, offering satisfaction to both child and parent. It is true that the small blocks can get lost in due time, but other than this, the Melissa and Doug Wooden Shape Sorting Clock is an excellent toy overall. It teaches children several skills and offers great durability, is made from wood, and requires no batteries. My little ones love it and continue to enjoy it day after day. It's an easy winner that belongs in every child's toy box.",

    "title": "Melissa and Doug Attempt to Teach World Geography",
    "text": "The Melissa and Doug World Map Puzzle is a large, two feet by three feet puzzle- a large enough size that most will assemble it on the floor or on a large table. A total of thirty- three pieces comprise this puzzle, and this is enough to make it semi- challenging without being too easy. Educational in nature, this world map clearly identifies each of the major continents and oceans, as well as identifying some of the animal species common to world's different regions.<br /><br />With an educational angle such as this, the Melissa and Doug World Map Puzzle would seem like an excellent puzzle that every child should own. However, there are a few problems with this puzzle and one will be obvious to anyone who opens the box for the first time and begins to assemble the pieces: The inner part of the puzzle does not include interlocking pieces. The frame of the puzzle does include standard, interlocking pieces, but the interior part of the puzzle does not. The interior pieces just lie there, next to each other, causing them to slide around and possibly adding to the frustration of the young person trying to assemble. This is certain to bother parents and children alike.<br /><br />The second problem I have with this puzzle is less important, but still deserves mentioning, and that would be the lack of labels on the countries and large bodies of water. The only places with names are the seven continents and the major oceans. National boundaries are shown, but there are no names for the countries. Some would say that this would make the puzzle too complicated, but considering this puzzle is aimed at the upper- elementary school ages, I think it would be a wise addition. It would add greatly to the puzzle's educational value.<br /><br />Looking at the positives, this puzzle is made from thick cardboard and thus the pieces are not likely to break. Also, even though I complained above about the lack of interlocking pieces, I admit that there is one small advantage to this arrangement: Learning the major land masses. Some of the continents have their own, individual pieces and this could help children to learn to associate the full continent with its location on the world map.<br /><br />In spite of its flaws, the Melissa and Doug World Map Puzzle is still a good puzzle, mainly because it still offers some educational value. This fact alone places it a notch above other puzzles and other toys on the market. The lack of interlocking pieces will annoy many children and parents, but the puzzle still has enough value to recommend.",

    "text": "Playskool Cool Crew Dusty Talking Vacuum is a cute toy that gives children the chance to imitate adults and older siblings in the act of cleaning. Children like to do the things they observe others doing and with this Playskool vacuum, kids can experience the sounds and actions of a vacuum cleaner, giving them the feeling that they are right there, next to mom and dad, keeping the home clean and livable.<br /><br />This vacuum is fun for toddlers for several reasons. First, it offers the open view of the inside, where kids can watch the swirling \"lint\" as they push the vacuum across the floor. This makes the vacuum look and seem like the actual vacuum that mom and dad use every week. Second, kids like the cute sayings and will often repeat them as they play. Dusty makes comments such as Who Spilled the Beans, Nobody Cleans Better than We Do, and more. Dusty talks to the child and talks back and forth with his sidekick- the attached brush. Kids will like the sayings and many will look forward to listening to Dusty talk about the cleaning task and how well they are doing.<br /><br />Many children's toys that include sounds are quite noisy, but this is one area where the Playskool Cool Crew Dusty Talking Vacuum is different. There are some sounds with this toy, but they are muffled and shouldn't bother anyone. Some toys offer loud noises and, worse, some do not have a switch to reduce the noise level. This vacuum doesn't have a switch to reduce the sound, but there is an on/off switch to stop the sound completely. The cool thing about turning off the sound is that the swirling and eye moments will still continue, and this could be enough to satisfy many children.<br /><br />As for fun and entertainment, this toy ranks above average, but one thing I have noticed with my girls is that they never play with it for very long. They continue to use it on a regular basis, which shows that it does have a certain appeal. However, they will push it back and forth for only about a minute or so, then set it aside in favor of other toys. This result would lead one to conclude that their interest is low, but the fact remains that they still reach for the vacuum on a regular basis. Even though it holds their interest for a very brief period of time, they still like it for its short burst of stimulation.<br /><br />Playskool Cool Crew Dusty Talking Vacuum is a fun toy for boys or girls in the preschool age group. It is very lightweight, makes little noise, and requires only a simple push across a floor to get it going. It isn't a huge hit with my youngsters, but they do like it consistently, even if only in small doses. It is a good toy that helps children feel like they are helping mom and dad while having a little fun in the process.",

    "title": "Elefun Doesn't Live up to its Name",
    "text": "Elefun is a simple game that requires no special setup and no special strategy. It is a somewhat physical game involving the catching of butterflies in a small net. These vinyl butterflies are placed in the base, the trunk is attached, the motor is turned on, and the butterflies slowly release from Elefun. The person who catches the most is the winner. It is a game that can be learned instantly and can be used to provide some quick entertainment when children are getting restless.<br /><br />Elefun offers some good points that make it a hit with most children; namely the action factor, which encourages children to physically compete as they scramble with their nets in hand, trying to catch as many butterflies as possible to win the game. But other than this, Elefun isn't as much fun as its name suggests. First, the action factor is actually a little on the slow side. I can agree that a gradual release of the butterflies from Elefun's trunk is a good idea, but the problem is the amount of time it takes for the trunk to expand and the slowness of the release of the vinyl butterflies. The motor is too weak to get the game going and some children will grow impatient having to wait.<br /><br />Another problem with Elefun is its tendency to eat up batteries. The game takes four batteries and they die quickly, mainly because the game is very brief and most children will want to play it again and again. If this happens, the batteries are not likely to last more than a few days. It is a little puzzling that four batteries would produce so little power and also die out so quickly, but this is exactly what happens. Then, there is the problem with the butterflies themselves. There are thirty of them, but no matter how they are placed in the base, Elefun doesn't release them all. There are always a few butterflies left, stuck in the base. Their small size makes them easy to lose, too.<br /><br />Kids like action- oriented games and most children will like Elefun at first. But once they are forced to stand around, waiting for the butterflies to release and once they realize how quickly the batteries fail, they will grow frustrated with this game and push it aside in favor of more reliable entertainment. It could be improved with a few simple changes, but until that happens, don't waste your time or money on Elefun.",

    "text": "Dora the Explorer is a popular children's television program for the under five age group and her likeness can be found on everything from food labels to clothing. She has also spawned a great deal of toys and the Fisher Price Dora the Explorer Talking Doll House ranks among the larger toys available, complete with fold out walls and expandable top, adding additional space that can keep children occupied for hours.<br /><br />The Fisher Price Dora the Explorer Talking Doll House is most notable for its size and the multiple rooms contained within. The best of the rooms is the kitchen because it is here where most of the sounds are created and where most of the fun can be found. The other rooms in the house are basically empty, but the kitchen already has built in appliances and other things. I have found that my girls like the kitchen most of all and they have fun playing with the refrigerator, stove, and other objects. They like activating the sounds and interacting with the included toy figures of Dora and her madre and padre.<br /><br />Speaking of the sounds, this is one of the main features of the Dora the Explorer Talking Doll House. These sounds are bilingual, but not always entirely so, and they are intended to help children learn Spanish words.  When a button is pressed, the refrigerator door is opened, etc., the phrase will be stated in English first. Press it quickly again, and the phrase will be repeated either entirely in Spanish, or with the final word or words in Spanish. All of them feature Dora's voice, so young fans of the show will easily recognize the voice and enjoy the sounds.<br /><br />This talking doll house has much to offer young fans of the television program, but there are some features/facts about this dollhouse that make it less than perfect. The way the sides fold open, platforms are created that can serve as a floor area while children play. This is nice, but the problem is there is no place to store any added accessories. The dollhouse is constructed in a way that makes it as compact as possible for better storage when folded shut. But this means there is almost no empty space on the interior for storage. And speaking of accessories, there are very few included with this doll house. There are exactly four: Three people figures and one couch. So, if you want more, you have to buy them separately, and this can greatly increase the overall cost of an already expensive toy.<br /><br />The construction of the Fisher Price Dora the Explorer Talking Doll House is strong and sturdy, but one piece that isn't so durable is the front door. The door isn't permanently attached, and thus it falls off very easily. When I first noticed this, I thought perhaps I got a defective doll house, but from reading other reviews, it looks like this problem is common. This means that the manufacturer made it this way. Why, I have no idea because not only is it annoying to open the door and have it pop off, it also means you have another piece that could potentially get lost.<br /><br />The Dora the Explorer Talking Doll House is a toy my girls love because is depicts one of their favorite television characters. They love the sounds and anything else that deals with Dora, and they enjoy the time they spend playing with this toy. However, parents will find many components of this toy troubling and will get annoyed by the constant sounds coming from the dollhouse as their excited children press and pull each of the sound- making objects over and over again. For these reasons, I can give the Fisher Price Dora the Explorer Talking Doll House only an average rating overall. If your children love the show, they will love this doll house. But parents will find it lacking in many areas.",

    "text": "The Fisher Price Backyardigans Sing `n Strum Guitar is a battery operated guitar, plastic in construction, small, and lightweight. It can be used by most any toddler, age one and older. It has sounds that are activated by pressing any one of seven different objects on the body of the guitar. One simple press of the object starts the sound; another press of the same object ends the sound. In these respects, this guitar is pretty much like other children's play instruments.<br /><br />My girl's like the many colors on The Fisher Price Backyardigans Sing `n Strum Guitar and they also like the sound effects. But from an adult perspective, this guitar is a little lacking when compared to others. The greatest problem I have with this guitar is the lack of variety with the tunes. There is only one complete tune available, and it isn't a well- known tune or song. It is just this little ditty telling kids they gotta hold on tight, hold tight, gotta hold on tight, hold tight..., etc. There isn't much to it, and it's very repetitious- again, from an adult perspective. The other buttons produce either a single sound effect or a couple of words. It's true that, if the string area is pressed, there are fifteen different songs, but these songs are only the voice of one of the Backyardigan characters who then follows the tune of a well- known song with a string of la, la, la, la, la. The actual words of the song are not sung. Fisher Price could have made this guitar better by including actual songs with words.<br /><br />The most annoying components of this guitar are: The blue, note- shaped tab that makes a loud, annoying sound; and the lack of sufficient volume control. There is a yellow- shaped star, just above the strings, that is intended to control the volume. But it doesn't do a very good job and, worst of all, its right there where youngsters can turn it. This is a flaw in the design- it really belongs on the back side of the guitar, away from a toddler's fingertips. Instead, all you get on the back of the guitar is an On/Off switch. The sound of the Fisher Price Backyardigans Sing `n Strum Guitar is rather loud, and thus it could benefit by having a volume control knob to reduce the decibels.<br /><br />Looking at all of the pros and cons, however, I still recommend this guitar. Children enjoy it and if you asked my little ones for their opinion, they would both give this guitar a thumbs- up recommendation for fun and entertainment. It isn't the best child's guitar on the market, but it does have enough positive qualities to make it a good addition to your child's instrument collection.",

    "text": "Scene It Jr. is an easier version of the regular Scene It game made popular by Disney and it is a game that is most enjoyed by youngsters between the ages of eight and sixteen. I have played both the regular Scene It game and this version and I have found both to be semi- challenging in their own way.<br /><br />Scene It Jr. is an interactive game that involves the use of both a board and a television and this is part of the games appeal. As most of us agree, kids watch lots of television and any game that includes the use of a television set is certain to be a hit with most youngsters. Not only does Scene It Jr. offer visual appeal, it also offers questions that relate to movies and television shows that are popular with the young people of today. Because of this, Scene It Jr. can prove to be a more challenging game than many people expect. Many of the movies, television shows, and pop culture questions cover shows and films that are popular only with the younger crowd. Many questions that involve topics unknown to adults can be answered quickly and effortlessly by children 17 and under, and this is part of the game's appeal to the younger crowd.<br /><br />Even though the questions in Scene It Jr. are generally geared toward young people there are exceptions and this is where older adults will have the edge. It is common to get, for example, questions about old television shows, sports celebrities, and other things that young people will not be able to answer. This is why I think it is best to play Scene It Jr. with teams that include a young person and an older person. This way, there will be less trouble answering the bulk of the questions and the game will move much faster. What the young person doesn't know, the older adult will know, and vice versa.<br /><br />Overall, Scene It Jr. is a good family game and it offers some fun game playing for kids and adults alike. The questions are all trivial in nature so don't expect anything educational or intellectually stimulating with this game. There are a few more adult- oriented questions also, but Scene It Jr. is a game made for kids and it makes a good choice for families with young people ages eight through teen.",

It was twenty four minutes,there were about four silly songs in that time,it didn't get into the roots of the tradition. The movie didn't have enough time to develop character. Some of the elves play pranks like spell things out in refridgerator magnets, or take marshmellow baths, but there wasn't any of the elf's playfull side. They could have done more with it.This won't be like The Santa Clause 1 and 2, or a christmas story where the kids will watch every Christmas into adult hood the kids will stop watching at about age six.",

I was making \"Snow\" (you have no clue how it's supposed to turn out is a big part of the problem).  At one point - stiring vigorously I got a combination of glue, borax water and \"snow\" blown in my eye.  It made my eyelashes stick together constanly - I suspect nail polish remover would have removed it but can't use that IN YOUR EYE - it took DAYs to get it all completely out of my eye and my eye was red for all the rubbing.  Probably harmless but this recipe should REQUIRE goggles before you use it.  It's got way more colors and scents than there are ingredients so be prepared to buy more glue especially.  The little girl I'm working with (age 7) is a little too immature to use a recipe but was more happy just play mixing stuff together that had to be thrown out so - due to the kneading time involved this is not a good project for an ADD child, but most kids and adults would love it.

My only issue is that some other seeds seemed to have been mixed with the seeds in the packages.  I have two sizes of \"sunflowers\" - only 3 of the plants actually look like they will be sunflowers and they grew so fast and tall they just fell over - the others are about 10x smaller an look just like the bigger sunflowers but on a MUCH smaller scale. There are about 20 of those.  These are kept under grow lights so they get plenty of lighting.  The other two plants - basil and carrots are growing but it looks like some other seeds got mixed in the packet because all the plants in the same pot don't look anything like each other.  That is a disappointment.  Also no real instructions on what to do with  floppy 3\" sunflower plants other than try to find a very tall pot until spring and perhaps try to stake them without killing them (they are very delicate).  At some point we'll have similar problems with the carrots and have to figure out a pot tall enough to transplant.  And I guess we'll have to wait and see what the other plants in the pots turn out to be.  We were very careful to do just one packet at a time to prevent seeds getting mixed up.

They also seem to build this crystalized stuff at the top that blocked all the holes - wonder if it blocked them from getting enough oxygen in their tunnels.  Instructions say to never open the lid because they bite,  But I think they are running out of oxygen - they're definitely not fighting, just dropping dead  Too bad you can't find large non-biting ants to fill these things, then you could interact with the ants more.",

The decoration on the back is nice. They are surprizingly well adjusted--my mother said they are bendable enough to learn to shuffle, even for a new deck (they have nice card-elasticity; most new decks are said to be stiff, but not these).<br /><br />Overall, i am happy with my purchase, at 7 bucks for this :) thanks Bicycle!",
