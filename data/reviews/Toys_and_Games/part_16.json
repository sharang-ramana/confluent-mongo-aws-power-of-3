It is nice because they can play with it for a long time.<br /><br />They have a nice collection now and play with them altogether. It's nice that this comes with extra stuff because it gives them a direction with which to play.<br /><br />I am always happy with the quality of the Barbie dolls. They really last nicely. The accessories are okay. If they are careful they will last but they can't be too rough.<br /><br />I think these make great gifts, too. I like that they are playing with dolls instead of staring at screens. These are durable and last a long time. I would recommend them.",

Once she is done putting together the item she will often make her own creations.<br /><br />I love the quality of the LEGOs. I don't think we have ever had one break and we have many, many sets. I also like that she has something to play with once she makes it. Of course she has to be careful with it, but if she is, she can play with it.<br /><br />These make great gifts. I think my kid loves it the best of all. It is good for both boys and girls. It is also nice when the set goes with something like this one does.<br /><br />This was a good set. She was able to put it together on her own. It really kept her occupied for quite a while. I think it is also educational. It is good that she can follow the directions and also for hand-eye coordination.<br />I would highly recommend this set.",

Once he is done putting together the item he will often make his own creations.<br /><br />I love the quality of the LEGOs. I don't think we have ever had one break and we have many, many sets. I also like that he has something to play with once he makes it. Of course he has to be careful with it, but if he is, he can play with it.<br /><br />These make great gifts. I think my son loves it the best of all. It is good for both boys and girls. It is also nice when the set goes with something like this one does.<br /><br />This was a good set. He was able to put it together on his own. It really kept him occupied for quite a while. I think it is also educational. It is good that he can follow the directions and also for hand-eye coordination.<br />I would highly recommend this set.",

It is nice and small which makes it very portable. I think this toy will also last longer than a lot of the other toddler toys because an older child would be interested in it too. It is not too loud to be bothersome to the parents. I think this would make a great gift. With five children elementary age and younger we have had many of the toys out there and this one is among my favorites. I would recommend it.",

She likes the little balls that make it rattle along with all the sounds that come from pushing the buttons. It worked perfectly for us without a problem. The sound isn't too loud or annoying.<br /><br />It is cute how the bear plays peekaboo. There is a mirror behind it. Kids this age love to look at themselves in the mirror so that is nice. She likes carrying it around and pressing buttons.<br /><br />It is bright and colorful and would work for a little boy or girl. It is a good toy to bring on the go. It would also make a nice gift.

My daughter really liked how they turned out. She was very excited to have made her own characters. She then spent a while playing with the characters.<br /><br />Overall this is a fun craft that has a nice result.",

She drinks and wets and and also talks. She says more than thirty different things.<br /><br />My daughter really loved her. She thought it was so fun. It came with lots of accessories. She is also a very pretty doll. Some of these lifelike dolls to me look a little strange but I think this one looked very nice. The hair is cute. We had no problem with it functioning. Like the other Baby Alive dolls, it is mostly hard so it's not going to be a super cuddly doll, but it wouldn't be able to crawl and do all the other stuff if it was. They really liked her. I would recommend it.",

It comes with tons of supplies such as test tubes, powders for the different experiments and more.<br /><br />The experiments were great. The kids really enjoyed them. I loved how educational they are. I think this is a great gift because it is educational and fun. With everything in there, you can spend hours working on it. We did it together as a family. I liked that after each experiment we can have a family discussion on that aspect of science to teach them even more.<br /><br />This could also be good for a preschool or elementary school classroom.<br /><br />I was happy with the quality.

    "text": "We have many of the different Lil Lockitz kits. This one is very nice because it is so big and includes many different pieces to make 19 lockets. It is great for a party, or in my case, a house with four daughters. With all these pieces there are so many combinations the kids can do to make themselves the lockets. They can make many different items, including bracelets, necklaces, key chains and more. There are many different backgrounds, charms, etc. from which to choose.<br /><br />It was easy for the kids to do. This is a nice craft in that it is both fun to do and gives them something in the end that they can actually use. So many crafts result in a &#34;decorative&#34; piece that really doesn't do anything. This is nice because they can then wear their jewelry.<br /><br />I was happy with the quality. The kids really liked the project and it was good for their creativity. I would recommend it.",

There are many things such as little rockets, paper, straws, a propeller and more. Your child can be creative to create something themselves.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give it five stars is because I think it was a little too self-guided. I wish they had given more step by step instructions for building more things so that the kids would at least have the option of using them. Obviously, they could always decide to build something themselves, but I would have liked the option of a machine that actually glided or flew a little. This would be especially good for the younger kids. Without the instructions, your child might put something together that looks great but it still might not fly.<br /><br />Still, I loved all the parts it came with and I think it is reasonably priced.

He likes the arm that grams the squid. It is neat that it can be used on water or outside. He will play with it in the bath.<br /><br />It feels pretty well made. We had no problems with quality. The helicopter isn't fancy but it squirts water as does the squid. Again, this is fun for the bath (or the pool). He uses the ramp for his cars.<br /><br />It is a good size, which he likes. It is unique and fun to use in different ways. I also think this could be a good gift. I would recommend it.",

What is neat is that you can flip the wall to change it between a castle and a high school. They really like this feature. They like the bridge a lot too. Many of the dollhouses only fit very small characters so this is nice that it fits the larger dolls. It also does fold a bit, which is nice. Many of these don't fold at all, so that is nice.

Young kids like things they can fasten and unfasten. It kept my child entertained for a while. It is a good size - not too big and not too small. It felt very well made. It is good for both a boy and a girl. I would recommend it.",

It goes over a lot of topics such as colors, shapes and the ABCs. It is a little shape sorter, too. It is colorful and pretty. She likes to take things in and out of it. It sounds nice. I like that it has three levels of play that you can change to your child's preference and age. She really liked it. It also it useful for older children as a garden caddy when they are doing &#34;pretend play.&#34;<br /><br />The only thing that I wished is that it came with batteries. I find that most smaller toys do, so this was a little bit of a hassle. Otherwise, I was very pleased with it. It worked just fine. We have a lot of the Laugh & Learn Toys (the home, the chair and more) and we have always been happy with this series. It is nice to have a small toy that she can easily carry around with her. Even if you don't want to listen to it, she can still play with it. I would recommend it.",

You can even fire the missiles by the remote control, which is different than the other toys we own. He really liked that.

Of course you have to make sure you have a place with enough room to do it. I like that it comes with six rockets so if you lose one you're still okay. We've had similar things that just came with one, so this is much better than that. It was very easy to put together. My son was so excited when he got it - he wanted to do it all the time. One part I love - you don't need any batteries. We have so many toys with batteries and then they run out and you have to change them and the money adds up. These were great and worked very well. Highly recommended.",

If you do not, you might have problems with it coming apart while you are starting the project and that can be very frustrating. If you glue it together first, then you can avoid that problem. That and the fact that the strings can get tangled easily are why I took off a star.<br /><br />Overall, though I think this is a nice craft. I really appreciate that it does not use pins or nails or anything else that would not be good for a child. I had once got one that looked cute but when I realized it had a bunch of pins I had to get rid of it because my daughter has young siblings. This one is completely safe.<br /><br />It's a fun craft. It is fairly simple and easy although there can be some tangling an adult might have to help with. There are lots of colors so lots of ways you can do it. Of course you can also get your own colors.<br /><br />I think it turned out pretty. It's something unique and nice to hang in the room. I think this would also make a nice gift. I like crafts a lot, and this one is nice.",

This set is nice because it comes with the four characters. Once they were done putting on Little Red Riding Hood, they put on other plays with the same characters. I would recommend them.",

If the fabric was to tear, it would be a real problem. I just plan on being careful to watch the baby while she is playing with this toy. Otherwise it is cute.",

It is different in that the board is not as large and players can stack letters on top of words.<br /><br />This is fun and a lot less repetitive than many of the other kids' games out there. I am trying to work on spelling with my kids (ages 9, 7 and 6) so this is a great way to teach them. It is much more fun than simply going over words. They enjoyed it. It is not based on sheer luck like so many of the kids' games, but requires skill.<br /><br />I was happy with the quality of the game. It does have a lot of small tiles, so you have to make sure to keep them together and not play it near a child who is still putting things in his or her mouth. Five stars for a great classic game.",

This is a great toy that combines the fun of a doll with a fun science experiment.<br /><br />I am happy with all aspects of this toy. I very much like the doll. It is pretty and attractive and my daughter loves it. I think it's cute that it comes with glasses, especially for kids who need glasses. She is similar in size to a Barbie doll, with a slightly larger head. My seven year old daughter loves playing with dolls, so this fit in nicely with her Barbies. It feels like a high quality doll.<br /><br />I was very happy with the experiment part, too. Of course the volcano experiment is a classic one, and I very much like that you can do the experiment over and over again. You do have to supply some of your own materials, but they are very upfront about that so it's okay. It's not expensive or anything to buy the few things. The experiment worked well.<br /><br />It's important to teach girls that they can enjoy science too. I would recommend this.",

I LOVE how it folds up - we have a lot of clutter in the house and that is really very nice. You don't usually have a toy that is over a foot tall be able to fold down so it's only three feet tall. It comes with two cars. It is colorful and good for both boys and girls. My daughter plays with lots of characters so it goes along nicely with her set. It is made for ages 12 months and up but it can be fun for older kids. It's nice to have a car set for younger kids since most of the matchbox cars are made for older children.

    "text": "My children really enjoy Descendants, and so do many others (It's one of the most popular movies out there right now). They also like playing with Barbie and similar dolls, so this is a great toy for them. They have a whole bunch of the Descendants dolls.<br /><br />This doll is of Audrey, the daughter of Princess Aurora and Prince Philip. In the movie she is a little bit of an antagonist, so they did not like her as much as the main protagonist (Mal, and secondarily Evie) but they could still play with her with the others. The doll itself is well made and comes with a pretty dress. I think it resembles the character in the movie. It can also be used as a general doll for children who are not as familiar with the movie. The accessories are nice.",

They have to learn how to do it but once you have the hang of it, it's not hard. There are sharp pins, though so you have to be very careful, especially if your child has younger siblings. The only thing I didn't like and the reason I took off a star was because it is really hard to hang. Because it is delicate and has all those pins, I really would've liked if I could've hung it easily. Still it is a fun craft and good for your own child or as a gift.",

Still, my daughter didn't seem to notice and I would recommend her.",

I hate to kill them but it's annoying taking them out every time I see one. This was really cool... the kids would use this and then take it outside. The spiders were fine. It worked really well.  Obviously this can be used to explore many other insects too. It's nice that it comes with both pieces - the vacuum to get the bugs and then a place to put them.<br /><br />The case is neat. It's a good size for a little kid. It doesn't just have to be for bugs  I was going to let my kids use it to collect seashells at the beach or flowers or leaves or rocks. It has a little magnifying glass and a light at the top.  They spent quite a while using these to explore. It felt like it was good quality. I liked this set much more than I thought and would recommend it.",

The children didn't even need me to tell them how to play - they just step on the disc that has the coordinating light light up. It gets harder because the lights come faster as you advance. My kids liked it and spent a while playing with it. They had fun.<br /><br />There are a few things I didn't like about this game. First, I wish it let more than two people play at once. It would be nice if it had a mode for a four person play instead of just a two person play. Also, I felt like it was a little loud. Some kids might like that it is loud though. Also, once when my son stepped on it, one of the round things came out. In general it worked fine.<br /><br />Overall this is a cute game, and it's nice that it has some physical activity in it. They aren't just sitting down for it. One kid who does it continuously can get quite a workout. My kids enjoyed it. I think it would also be nice for a party.",

You can explain the different principles of physics as you go through it. This provides such a nice basis for learning about science.<br /><br />The projects were fun for my daughter to do.

My six-year old son loves dinosaurs (and the color green so it's perfect) and he loves making these dinosaurs. You can use the instructions to make the dinosaurs that they specify (a t-rex, triceratops, etc) and my kids did that first. They could make two dinosaurs at once, although not necessarily all the dinosaurs) Afterwards, though, they spent forever making their own creations. With over two hundred pieces, there were plenty of pieces for three of my kids to all make creatures simultaneously. They really enjoyed it, and I like that they used their creativity.<br /><br />The pieces are made of foam, and at first I know I was hesitant about this, but I've found that they were remarkably strong. We never had a problem with one breaking and my kids can be rough. These were easy enough for my kids to do on their own. Once they made the creatures they played with them. For the size creatures they make, the box isn't too big, so they just put everything back when they were done and could make more the next time. Overall, it is a great product that I would recommend.",

It looks kind of like a sub and has room for the little gups (little boats) inside or on top of it. It rolls along nicely. It comes with two little gups, but you can buy more that will go along with it. It can launch them through it's front.<br /><br />My kids very much enjoyed playing with this toy. They have a variety of the Octonauts toys and this went along very well. It seemed to be good quality, and everything worked as it should. My kids enjoyed it for pretend play.",

The bracelets are pretty ribbons that are different colors. It comes with a variety of charms to put on them.<br /><br />Here are my issues with this product: First, it is VERY hard to get the ribbon through the charms.  It was too hard for my nine year old to do so I had to do it for her, which kind of ruined the point of it being a craft. Even if she had been able to do it, she could have made them all in about five minutes. So it's not something anyone will spend a lot of time on. There is another issue, which was why I bumped it down to three stars. The only closure is to tie it... it's not like it has a clasp or anything. So because of that, a lot of girls might put it on too tightly... I really had to keep an eye on her to make sure she didn't accidentally do it. You can make a bow but then it might come out and a knot is hard to take in and out.<br /><br />Overall, cute idea and cute look, but there are flaws.",

I like that it has wheels so the children can push it along. The bottom of the boat opens, which is a nice feature that kids enjoy. When you turn the character on a little platform, it puts out cannons that shoot. Also, when you push a secret lever, it makes the crow's nest fall down.

It also has so many nice touches - the barn doors slide open and shut, the door opens, there's a pen that opens. The one thing I don't like is that the two halves come apart... they should have made it so that it stays hinged on one side. It needed very minimal assembly - just putting a few panels on. One other thing I didn't like is that I think if it is handled roughly, the parts will come apart and then there are some small parts that can get lost. It came with some nice animals, which felt heavy and of much better quality than the cheap characters you normally see.

    "text": "This is a very cute toy. My daughter loves to play pretend with little dolls wherever she goes. This toy  makes it easy to carry her little characters around and gives a  colorful place to play with them. It was very bright and colorful and well designed. It has 4 rooms with the children can play pretend. It comes with 1 doll.<br /><br />The outside is made of plastic. The only reason I took off a point was because the inside rooms were made out of card board and I felt like it would've been a lot nicer if that had been plastic instead.<br /><br />This toy is going to get a lot of use. My girls love barbie and the secret door but any barbie fan would enjoy it. It is very convenient for when you are on the go.",

We have lots of big toys so I was glad this wasn't gigantic. It looks really nice - half car, half green, scary looking lizard/monster/dinosaur/dragon - whatever your child wants to make it. It worked well. it's definitely different than other remote control vehicles with how many different terrains it'll go on. I was very impressed by that. It's great for kids wanting to put it through small, shallow puddles. The range was fine for what we wanted to use it for... I was happy and would recommend it.",

Now my kids thought it was hysterical and probably liked it better for this, but I didn't quite feel like it did exactly what you would think it should from the box, which is why I lowered the score.

Advantages are that it isn't messy and can be used over and over again. for a child who is into Spiderman it can be really cute.<br />There are some drawbacks to the toy. The shooter doesn't hold that many discs. Also, one big issue is how big and heavy it is. I feel like it was actually a little big for my son's arm - a lot of kids who would enjoy this would have trouble holding it on their arm for a long time because it is so heavy and big. Also, some kids may find it too repetitive/boring. It does have sounds, which can be a plus or a minus - it enhances the toy and makes it more fun for the kids but may bother some adults.

The thing is my kids just haven't played with it that much, and they love Sophia. There just isn't really that much to it. It's very small... can only really be used with the small characters, and even with them there's not a lot of room to do anything. The other thing is that it seems to be very cheaply made. It is pretty thin plastic, and I honestly do not see this lasting long. Sophia is a character that appeals to very young kids, and I think something for that would have to be sturdier to really last. With all the playsets that are larger, have more to them and are better put together I might consider something else.",

Apparently even though they have a customer service email they don't appear to use it for customer service, I was told they are &#34;old fashioned&#34; that way. Well, email might be new, but it is really convenient and annoying that you have to waste your time on the phone for nothing.

The design is the same, but the colors are brighter and the pictures have changed a bit to reflect the movies.<br /><br />The unit shipped with two parts broken that will require them to replace the entire unit.  We'll see how they handle that and I'll update my review.  It is also missing two pieces.  And when I looked back at my old dreamhouse I found that two things that were broken on this one were broken on that one two and I just never noticed that they were supposed to light up (the fridge light and the fireplace light).<br /><br />The elevator still doesn't work right.  The cords on both elevators are an inch too short to actually go through the guides, and the clip holding it on at the top comes off every time it is used.  I assume this is a problem with every unit since two units 3 years apart had the problem.<br /><br />The new hottub doesn't light up like the old one did.  But this isn't a big deal.<br /><br />The assembly takes about 20 minutes if you are adept at putting things together and reading VERY POOR instructions.  I have assembled thousands of things from toys to furniture to things at work and these are sub-par.  The only real complaint is the sheet of stickers which you have to put on in a very exacting way and which should have been factory applied.  There is no excuse for not simply having the machines that built the house do this step and it means that most of us will have imperfect looking finished products.<br /><br />For fun I would give this product many stars.  The kids enjoy playing with it. It is big, pink, has Barbie and fits Barbie sized dolls.  I would recommend this overall but know that it is not quite as sturdy as it can be.",

Although I do fit on the bike with some difficulty, I am too big to use it effectively and I can't get up enough speed to do any tricks.  My 4 year old daughter, on the other hand, is too small to ride it.  It looks like an 8-12 year old would fit perfectly.  Speaking as someone who was an 8-12 year old boy (22-18 years ago respectively), I can say that any 8-12 year old boy should enjoy this toy.  However, I believe it is the type of thing that will get old pretty fast.  It has basically one trick (spinning out to turn like drifting in a car) and once you master that you're out of things to do.<br /><br />Okay, just for the coolness factor I am keeping it for when the kids are older...And I can't say that there's no chance I won't try to use it again because it was kind of neat.

This set is super affordable when compared to the... other brand and the quality of the bricks are very good.  I've tried other off-brand bricks before and those didn't fit very well, these blocks do.<br /><br />This set comes with 12 bags of bricks that build 12 little models as you see in my pictures.  Each of these bags also have a second model that they can build.  Just follow the \"A\" model instructions to build the first model and the \"B\" model instructions to build the alternat vehicle.  The last model combines all of the sets to build the large Space Shuttle.<br /><br />What a fun set of bricks with good rebuild value because of all the different configurations.  Great product.",

    "text": "I loved my experience building this 3D Metal Model of the London Eye.  I visited this attraction years ago and it was definitely nice to revisit it in this manner.<br /><br />Firstly, my main advice to anyone interested in building these models is:  BUY A TOOL KIT!  I purchased this [[ASIN: B096DT59T7 17 Pieces Metal Puzzle Tool Set]] for this build.<br /><br />Previously, I build a very simple Eifel Tower model and a San Francisco Trolley metal model without a toolkit and while they were fun to build, they also weren't easy because I didn't have the right tools.<br /><br />It seems that metal models have come a long way, I found this model to be well laid out and clearly labeled.  I was also impressed with the paint that they were able to put on some of the parts, giving some nice accents to the piece.  The directions were clear enough, but you do need to read all of the prerequisite parts at the beginning.  I didn't know that they labeled in their diagrams exactly which side should be up when building until maybe the third step.<br /><br />With a snipper, removing the parts were fairly simple -- although my snipper was a little too big for some of the tabs.  using the folding tool included with my toolkit, I was able to fold straight lines cleanly.  I also used the metal rods included in my kit to roll the curves that the directions called for.<br /><br />What may be frustrating for some people are the 32 gondolas that need to be built.  I didn't mind it at all because this is what model building is about, right?  Patience and persistence.  The other difficult part was rolling the legs of the wheel.  There just isn't a clean way of putting that together and I scratched some of the paint off with my pliers.<br /><br />In the end, I was quite satisfied with the model and had a great time with the build.  This has reignited my passion for small, detailed work that I might just continue to build more models.",

    "text": "I've always been fascinated by these wooden puzzles.  I have an interest in getting into laser engraving and cutting.  These puzzles are a great example of what one can achieve with a laser.<br /><br />The Wood Trick Electric Space Junk Robot was my first wooden puzzle and I had a great time putting it together with my son.  The instructions were clear and easy to follow and the assembly requires no glue but make sure that you pay attention to the symbols that signify where some sanding is needed and where to use the included wax to ensure smooth motion between the moving parts.<br /><br />Some parts might be tricky to remove.  I use the rounded end of a Bic pen to push the parts out and generally, I just try not to splinter any of the parts.  While putting this together, I appreciated how well the parts were designed.  The tolerances between the parts were perfect and each fastener fit well for most of the model.  The biggest difficulties we had was trying to fit the top of the body to the bottom wheel platform.  There were a lot of pegs to match up and due to that, the final fastener pieces didn't fit perfectly due to the tabs not being pushed through completely.<br /><br />I will definitely be getting more of these puzzles.",

    "text": "Power adapter manufacturers and power strip adapter manufacturers have both tried to address problems with power adapters taking up too much space by either making the power adapter slimmer or rotating the plug/socket in different ways but with the kind of luck that I have, I will inevitably end up with a combination where the power adapter is turned in just the wrong way to require it to take up more than one socket's space.<br /><br />With the HLS Surge Protector, I don't have this issue.  Each of the sockets are far enough apart where even the larger power adapters from my cable modem and router fit easily and with the ability to turn in in different ways, I can save space by folding the strip in half.  My only problem was that there were only four sockets but that was fine.  I put all of the devices that have big power adapters on the HLS and a second, smaller, power strip took care of my PC.<br /><br />In my case, I also have a small travel router that I hacked with Openwrt to provide media sharing capabilities and that router ran on USB power.  The USB port on the HLS Surge Protector came in handy for it.<br /><br />So two things you need to be aware of when considering this power strip:  There are only 4 sockets and two USB sockets and this power strip is pretty big.  When I received it, I was surprised at how long it is.  Each socket is far enough apart to where adapters would fit nicely even if this power strip wasn't flexible.  The flexibility gives you the ability to fit this strip around the wiring or fit into the space you have available.",

    "text": "I bought this RC plane to enjoy with my seven year old; he loves remote control toys, and is still developing the skills to control them. I have dabbled in RC models myself with some hours of intermediate level RC helicopter and fixed wing experience; I figured a durable, simple, slow model was a good place to start for a beginner. Bonus points for not having to build it. This model fits the bill!<br /><br />First off, the airplane is foam, simple to assemble, and durable. The instructions caution the pilot to cut the motors as soon as it collides with something; my son hasn't done that all the time, and it is still going strong. The props are pushers, so are actually pretty hard to ram into hard objects as they are behind the nose and wings. The rest of the plane is soft foam, and seems to be unaffected by crashing.<br /><br />Second, the controls are simple. All you have are throttle (which isn't very sensitive) and yaw which is controlled by the motors and not the rudder. The floaty biplane design and lack of elevator controls means a beginner can just jam on the throttle and the plane will begin a series of porpoising climbs and stalls to a net altitude gain without drama. With a little practice and a gentle throttle thumb, you can nicely control this plane. My son and I fly it off our deck, and I can fly it out and back to my hand easily. It is slow and easy to track, and we've even flown it with a light breeze (with best results mostly pointing it windward). My son has no problem circling it around and getting used to the controls. Which brings me to my third point.<br /><br />This plane is tough. It has been crashed what seems like a couple of times a minute, and seems no worse for wear. Its light weight, simple and flexible construction, and the aforementioned pusher prop layout make it pretty bombproof. It's been on and off our roof. It's hit bird feeders, walls, trees, and bushes. It's landed on its nose, tail, and wings, sometimes all in the same landing. And it still flies fine, with no downtime yet.<br /><br />For the downsides, you need some space to fly it. The \"indoor\" rating on the package probably means a gym or another large space with high ceilings. The plane just doesn't have the nuanced controls to effectively steer it inside the average house. The soft and floppy construction and nose-high design that make it so good for inexperienced flyers also limit its capacity for aerobatics and such, but that is pretty much an expected trade-off. So know what you are getting, and you will be pleased.<br /><br />In summary, this is a fun toy for kids of all ages with a shallow learning curve to get proficient. This would be a good initial purchase to court the flying bug, and a fun, downtime-free RC experience for all pilots.",

All items are toys but the makeup feels so real that even my 4 year old son loves to play with it with my daughter. The lip stick rolls up, just like a real tube and the rubberized stick feels soft to the touch. The cap however did crack from it being pushed on too hard but I believe it was my son who has the tendency to be rough. I love that this kit is updated with times and includes brushes instead of the old school applicators. They are full length brushes. The make up back is thick with a nice zipper track. I love that it has 2 zipper pulls! It's very easy to open and close. It's also a deep bag so it holds the pieces easily with room to dig in to find what you need. The way she adores it brings happiness to my heart. She loves to sit and watch me do my make up and now she can enjoy applying it too. The eyeshadow and blush are foam pads but feel so real. She wipes the brush over and instantly takes it to her eye kids or cheeks. Her favorite of all, is the nail polish. It is oddly satisfying to run the brush over your fingernails without polish even for adults. Something about it is so satisfying 😅 I love playing with her and her makeup. She feels so big and proud to use it. Will be using this with her new vanity she's getting for her 2nd birthday. Wonderful set 🖤 Only recommendation is a lip stick cap that doesn't crack as easy.

She looks cute with it.  The purse can play a few different tunes and sound effects when you press the heart button or slide the toy “zipper” at the bottom.  The top of the bag close magnetically.  My only complaint is the massive plastic brick at the bottom that contains the batteries and speaker.  It's about the size of a smartphone but much much thicker (maybe 3X?) and adds a lot of weight to the bag.  This could have EASILY been designed to be MUCH smaller and it seems lazy and stupid that it's so massive.  Also it makes this toy unwashable.  The plastic phone in this set is not interactive and does not do anything.  Aside from this, it's a nice little toy and for this price (around $15) I think it still deserves 5 stars.",

Have a little extra fun by adding a tattoo, details on the cloak, or whatever you want.  Mine arrived unbroken, but if yours breaks it's an easy fix with a little hobby glue - or you can return/exchange free from Amazon, since they always take care of their customers.",

It seems fairly sturdy, except for the baskets/shelf at the bottom.  It looks about the same as the photo and was fairly easy to assemble, with step-by-step picture directions included.  You will need a multi-screwdriver (ideally electric) to assemble.  The white-side is a dry-erase board that is magnetic.  This easel includes a magnetic Olaf puzzle (9 or 12 pieces) and magnetic alphabet.  The Black side is a non-magnetic blackboard, which will probably not be used much, and no chalk is included.  I rate this 4 stars because of the paint issues (see my attached photos).  First, the paint has a strong nasty smell that will fill your apartment and last for days, maybe longer.  Second, paint is missing/chipped on some edges (photo), roughly textured in some spots (photo), and other colors are smudged in some places (photo) to give this a classic made-in-China look.  Only the paint on the Elsa/Anna art at the top is nice.  Whoever painted this is worse at painting than my 5 year old is.  Overall, it's still a nice gift and a good price, but expect some paint flaws and a strong smell if you buy this.",

    "text": "After unboxing, I was immediately impressed with the sturdiness of the construction.  The hoop is solid metal and the backboard feels sturdy and strong, too.  I doubt this would ever break under normal use, unless your kids try to hang on it.  The balls have all held their inflation well after a few months, too, and you get 4 of them.  The only minor issue is that the ball-to-rim size ratio is not very forgiving, so it can be bit hard for your little ones to make baskets.  Would be nice if it had an extra bracket for height adjustment.  Still, I think this is a great set and great price.",

As it's a contrast paint - NOT a normal paint - you have to be more careful about how you apply it.  Apply a very thin coat (or even partly diluted with water or medium) for a bright blue (assuming a white/light undercoat) or more thickly for a medium blue with dark crevices/details.  I like this one more than most of my contrast paints (except for Snakebite Leather - which is the best) and would recommend this one if you are looking for a brilliant blue that can be applied in various brightness levels/shades.",

You cut off as much as you need, thoroughly mix the green and blue, shape and apply it, then wait for it to harden.  It takes several hours at minimum to harden.  The consistency is very thick, sort of like a clay/rubber mix.  I wish this company made a softer version (like Milliput) for filling tiny cracks.  When dried, Green Stuff does not sand well, so make sure you have it exactly how you want it before it dries.  It does stick really well, though, and being able to sculpt/shape it is nice.",

    "title": "Fantastic basic paint set - will buy again.",
    "text": "Vallejo paints are known to be one of the top brands of paints for minis, and after using this set I can see why.  The paints all come smoothly out of the bottle (tested each one) and most hold their consistency well.  What stands out to me is the pigments - they are finer and probably more concentrated than many brands, so you are able to thin your paints a bit more for layering and glazing.<br /><br />A couple notes on individual colors:  The fur brown is more watery than the other paints, but when dried produces an interesting matte texture similar to fur.  So, it's kind of an effects paint.  Some of the darker colors like the green and blue can look almost black when too thick, which can be great for shading, but maybe tricky if you're wanting a uniform color.  They're almost like a contrast paint, imo.  The metallics are great - shiny, and not a weird hue.  Best of all, the white in this set is amazing for whites and easily my favorite white (not off-white) of the 4 white brands I own.  As you may know, white paints are tricky to paint with because they tend to be chalky, uneven, and sometimes clumpy due to the nature of the white pigments used.  But this Vallejo Dead White is the smoothest, nicest, most uniform white I've tried.  When it runs out, I'll buy it again.<br /><br />Although Vallejo paints are a bit more expensive than many competing brands, I do believe they are high quality and more consistent as well after trying this set.  I wish it included a purple instead of 2 browns, but that's a minor thing since you can mix a purple if needed.<br /><br />That being said, for beginner painters it's nice to have colors/shades pre-mixed in order to plan a color scheme.  It would be nice if Vallejo made a set bigger than 16, but not quite so big as their 72pc set.  For anyone wanting more than these 16 colors (me!) you have to either get the 72pc set or buy colors individually.  Anyway, this set is a great place to start for beginners OR experienced painters wanting to upgrade to a premium quality paint.",

Unfortunately (and stupidly) the paint set includes does not include a flesh tone, so good luck mixing that.  The other issue is the cheap plaster models chip and break VERY easily, so be extra careful not to break them - they are very fragile.  The included brushes don't have sharp tips, so you might need to get her a better brush to paint the eyes and details.  Still, a fun set for little girls to enjoy.",

It will take her a little practice to use the tools included with the set. For now, she is doing a good job putting the wooden pieces together by twisting the little nuts & bolts with her fingers, and I help her by tightening them. Set comes with ideas on what to build, which my daughter is a little too young to use. But they are VERY good instructions, stating which wooden pieces to use and how many of each. Nuts and bolts are plastic.",

Good quality, and holds up really well against the elements and our wild thangs!<br />I only wish it had a horn. Almost took a star away for it's lack of a horn, but I knew going in that it didn't have one and still thought it was the best bet.

I think said nephew is a little young for this- he was scared to try it after watching his 15 year old sister yelp after getting shocked by the game. But it was definitely entertaining for all of us to watch this game being played. We were just about rolling on the floor laughing watching the grown men's reactions to the impending shock! I'm glad I ordered two of these and I'll consider buying more if another occasion arises. You can pick the number of players, from 1–4. Each player holds a 'joystick' while the machine plays suspenseful music and the light flashes red. Once the light turns green, the last player to press their button gets shocked! Just a couple of quick FYI's: One player found out the hard way that if you push the button early to avoid being last, it shocks you immediately! Also, a listing I saw here on Amazon mentioned a medium setting. However, I only saw regular and intense settings.",

I had about 10 other items coming too so I didn't expect the wagon to be in this little box lol. My initial reaction was to send it back because we need something bigger for our daughters to haul things (and each other) around our big back yard. But after checking it out, I decided to keep it because it seems VERY durable and I think it will be great for indoor play.  I love the simple, solid plastic body. It's really exactly the kind of wagon I've been wanting for outside, only its about 4x too small and the handle can't be used to steer it by someone riding it. The handle is fixed, so you have to drag the wagon along the floor or ground to turn it.  The girls have been having a blast pulling each other up and down the hallway, despite the fact that my 9 month old is the only one who fits inside comfortably. And it's not tearing up or scratching my hardwood floors, either, which is a def plus. I guess all in all, good buy considering the price. And my hunt for the perfect outdoor wagon for us continues!",

Seems like it would be less wasteful if they just packaged in them in the first place.<br /><br />Lots of fun colors. Not a lot of each one so best to get several kits if you have a ton of kids.",

Not impressed with the stencils for kids that came. They are nothing like the picture in the description. Very small and they would be hard for kids to use.  This product is easily scratched, so separate the piece you want from the rest of the sheet so as not to damage the rest of the paper. Simply sliding your hand along it if you have rough skin can cause marking. I sealed my work when it was done to make it stable.",
