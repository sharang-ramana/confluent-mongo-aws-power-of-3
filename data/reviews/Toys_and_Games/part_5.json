    "text": "My kids adore Lalaloopsy! They were thrilled to get this treehouse. It is cute and fun.<br /><br />The pieces are tiny. Not just the dolls, which are much smaller than I would have anticipated, but there are little accessories that are so tiny. It'd be difficult for an adult to play with these tiny accessories. The small pieces ended up discarded by the kids almost immediately. They were just frustrated by them, not being able to use them for much of anything.<br /><br />The doll figures themselves are small. Much smaller than I anticipated. They are also not the best quality. The details are a bit sloppy on them, which isn't something I expected from Lalaloopsy. The kids like the dolls.<br /><br />The treehouse itself is a nightmare. If you manage to get it out of its packaging without breaking it, you then get to refer to a diagram to try to set the thing up. Tiny ropes to make tiny zip lines. Tiny swings with tiny attachments. It took me a good 15 minutes to get everything set up like it showed in the diagram. Then one of the kids touches it. Then they beg me to reset up what they just messed up. And on and on it goes. Me resetting the thing up every 5 minutes, because they certainly can't do it. After a day or so, they forgot the zipline was there, forgot about the pulleys, overlooked the swings, and just played with the dolls around the treehouse, not in the treehouse.<br /><br />This is a very frustrating toy. It is too small, too fragile, and too complicated for kids to actually enjoy. I can't see any kid under the age of 12 begin able to appropriately work this toy. Any kid able to use it is probably too old to enjoy it.",

The Pillow Pet is the full-size version. I was a little wary of the book. Most product placement books are pretty lacking in story quality. I was actually surprised that the book wasn't that bad. It is 32 pages long and hardback. The pictures are a bit odd, since all the characters are Pillow Pets. But overall, the book is a nice touch to go with the Pillow Pet. The book will win no awards, but it is a cute story that kids will love. My daughter loves them both!",

We've had Tippy for quite some time and she's been drug all over the place with us. With the wipe of a damp cloth she looks brand new!<br /><br />I was concerned with Lalaloopsy doll's eyes being buttons. I couldn't imagine that being a good idea. But they are made onto her face, no chance of coming off at all. It is made to look like buttons are sewn on her eyes, but they are part of her molded plastic head.",

His parrot does look a little more like a crazy chicken of some sort. My only wish is that Patch's eyepatch was permanent. It comes off. So our patch has been patchless since about 2 hours after he was opened. I also LOVE that Patch has permanent whitie tighties on under his clothes. Helpful for a 2 year old to have toys that have on big boy underwear for potty training purposes. I know this toy is supposed to be for older kids, but it really is a great doll, even for a 2 year old. The shoes and patch are really the only small parts, and you can easily take those things off.<br /><br />I just wish they made more boy Lalaloopsy dolls. It is hard to find dolls for boys.

Within minutes of being out of the box, my kids were throwing him off the porch to see how far her could parachute. They were very entertained. I did not have GI Joes as a kid, so I can't really compare them to the original. There are a lot of small parts, so they aren't kidding on the 5 and up age thing. (Although, my 4 year old is okay with him, but he is pretty mature with toys and isn't a chewer.) He has a flashlight, pistol, rifle, knife, belt, holster, goggles, backpack, other random baggage (I'm not hip on the army terms for such things), helmet, and boots- that all come off. Some of the parts are too small for the kids to work themselves (particularly hooking the knife onto the belt). Their kid fingers just can't seem to work those tiny buttons and clips. It is hard for me to do it! (I seriously thought we were going to have to break out the tweezers for that blasted knife.) Despite that, they love GI Joe.

    "text": "My two oldest were thrilled to get Makayla! (5 year old girl, 4 year old boy) They loved her, for a day or so. She doesn't come with too many small parts, just the shoes, really, are small enough to be of concern.<br />Immediately out of the box, her head popped off. She has a huge head for her body (which is cute) but it makes it easy for her head to pop off. (It easily pops back on.) If the kids fight over her, her head pops off. It is easy enough to put back on that they don't need my help with it, but I foresee a day when we have a head with no body or a body with no head floating around the toy box.<br />I loaded the CribLife.com website up. They were minutely interested in the website. You can create your own room and pick your doll. It really seemed like more of a marketing strategy to get you to buy more of the dolls, because it shows all the dolls and prompts you to \"get to know them\" which translated into the kids pouring over the computer to determine which one they wanted next. Once that was determined (the result- all of them), they went on about their business and wanted nothing more from the website. I tried to see if they were interested in creating a room for Makayla, but they wanted to create a place in their room for Makayla. They weren't too interested in the virtual aspect of the toy.<br />I also wanted to add that she is pretty small. I thought she'd be regular Baby Alive size, but she isn't. Her head is the size of a softball and her body is tiny compared to that. It is almost a mini-doll, though slightly larger than most of the mini-dolls on the market.",

However, the LeapFrog phonics set is less of the \"fun\" stuff from other Leapfrog books (the sound effects, popular characters, etc.) and more actual reading practice. While this set of books is a decent resource for teaching young children to read, it isn't the best. First, the whole premise of the Tag system is a bit flawed. The kids learn to love the electronic ability of the Tag, not the book itself. They rely on the pen to bring the book to life, not their imaginations. So, it is a bit of a slippery slope with the Tag system. My children use the Tag for fun in their play time, but reading lessons do not include use of the Tag. The Phonics Books are a decent resource to have, and they do love the books. If you are trying to teach your child to read, this is probably not for you. If you are looking for something fun that will supplement their learning, this is a decent resource for you.",

It does not sit up at all, even when propped up against something, because the filling forces it to bounce flat. I was going to set it on the edge of my hospital bed table, after I drew 'clean me here' on certain areas (for the CNA's that don't do their job properly), but it will not sit. It should have been made fully of plastic, as it appears to be. Instead, just the lower legs, feet, lower arms, hands and head are plastic. Also, as you can see in my video clip, the pacifier is far too big for the baby's mouth, and also looks vaguely pornographic...smh...Would you want YOUR little girl getting an early education from this toy?

I like that the rules are pretty easy and it works a little like tetris as you try to cover space and penalty areas with rocks while protecting bonus areas with trees.  It is a nice little exercise in spatial relations and simple long term strategy.  We actually restarted once a couple of us had epiphanies about what they should have done.  But the kind of cool thing is that as you go on and build on what you know and have played, your open new rules and get new pieces introduced that again challenges your placing skills.  I found it to be a unique game.  We played it with four people ages 13-50s and it played well for those ages, but might not be good for the under 10 crowd.  Also, the game took a few evenings, so you need to be able to put the game aside and have the same players available to pick it up again.<br /><br />The game pieces are nice and I love the enveloped stages.  It is a well made game and a good idea.  Simple to play, but with enough mental challenge to get you thinking a little.

I eventually got four of us together and we started slogging through the rule books and it seemed like a lot of it was just coming to a consensus on what we just read meant.  Which also did not inspire people into thinking they were enjoying the game.  The flicking was kind of fun, and connection to drawing was interesting concept, but flicking seemed kind of random and no one was able to incorporate it into a strategy.  We stumbled through a round and scoring and I fear that the game will not come back out of the closet.  Perhaps we will try it again, I'm really not sure why the family was so soured against this game.<br /><br />***** updating *****<br /><br />This game eventually found a champion in our oldest son who took it up and read the rules and requested that we try it with him.  He found it kind of fascinating and I have to admit that with a more receptive group, it was better. I still found that there were a lot of kind of random happenings and you get random bonuses in other sections from the one you were starting on, but we have had a few strategy conversations and he is looking forward to plyaing it again.  It is a bizarre game, but unique and it definitely struck a chord with my son.  So I am bumping this review up to four stars.",

Strange that you can go out on the first round of a game and have to watch a number of rounds until you can come back in.  It definitely plays better with more people. We played four and it was ok, five was better and the full 10 would probably be a lot better.  Love the garbage container box - it was immediately coveted for many other uses.

In fact, due to issues with drawing with the string, it seems to lean a little toward charades.

And what better game to play on a camping trip, than a bear attack game!  Actually, my partner does litigation for endangered carnivores and points out this game puts bears in a bad light, but it is just a game.<br /><br />The game is very simple and can be picked up quickly by even young players.  The action is fast and frantic.  The scoring might be the hardest concept as the scoring can flip based on whether all bears are shot or if some survive.  You dice might go from a winner to a loser or the opposite.  That is also a nice surprise at the end of a round.  Great game for a quick game, I can see this being a regular on our trips.",

This might be my least favorite Lego set since my kids started collecting them 15 years ago.  They didn't even show interest in building it (ages 12-18.) So it seems like this may have just been too young a set so this Lego family to appreciate.  We didn't even care for the pieces in general.<br /><br />This was a surprisingly disappointing kit for modern Legos.",

There are a number of colors like hot pink that are not ones that we are looking for.  I would have prefered more bricks per color and less colors overall.  There are some good elements like windows and roofing pieces, but again, not enough of any one to make them usable for larger builds.  So it is a limited, but good set.",

    "text": "The best thing this adds to the original Silver is adding more ways to mess with other players hands.  My favorite is the ability to shuffle a players facedown blind cards so they know longer know where their cards are. That is a great twist for the game.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with Silver, it is very much like the classic card game Golf with a bunch of twists.  If you are not familiar with golf...you are trying to get the least amount of points by trading out high cards for low cards.  To replace a blind card you need to replace it with a low card.  This could be good or you could be handing a great card to the next player.  Once you know you have the lowest points you announce it and everyone gets one more round to get lower than you.  If you are the lowest, you get no points.  If you are wrong you get your hand plus a penalty.  That basic concept plays through Silver and Golf.<br /><br />Where Silver differs is that you have some beautifully illustrated cards that have additional actions other than just values like Golf.  Also, there is a mechanism to remove pairs so you can actually remove a card from your hand (village.)  And like I said, even more in this version, unlike Golf, you can mess with your neighbors.  It is a great improvement on a classic game concept.",

    "text": "There have been a number of games based on the the concept of the Golf card game.  Like that game, the point of this game is to have the lowest amount of points in your hand while having a number of blind cards that may be high or low.  So you need to replace them while possibly and accidentally passing a great card to the next player in the discard pile.  Much like Golf, once you think you have the best hand, you call and end to the game and everyone gets one more round to try to improve them hands.  If you are lowest, you get zero points, if you are not, you take a penalty.<br /><br /> So that is the basic idea behind the game, but from there, there are many twists to make the game more interesting.  Each card has a secret ability to allow you to see the other card in your village (hand.)  Also, there is a mechanism to remove duplicate cards which allows you to quickly dump a lot of points from your hand (village.)<br /><br />The cards are very nice, the amulet is also nice and allows you to lock a great card so that neither you or others can mess with it. The box could be a lot smaller, basically this is a deck game with a single piece for locking a card.  you could put it into a box for a pack of hoyles cards.<br /><br />All in all, an interesting twist on a classic card game concept.",

Basically, you are passing cards to help each other make sets and cover the numbers on a phone keypad.  There are rules governing how to pass and who to pass too and lots of communication as you try to get cards where they need to go.  You can also make sets of cards that allow you to extend your game by flipping your one minute timer.  We found the first round pretty easy actually, and then came the twists...  It has a good variety of challenges that make a nice straight forward game more challenging.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game.

In some ways that seems to be a unapologetic marketing trick to force you to buy the whole line.<br /><br />They tore into the build and had it put together in a couple hours that were interupted by supper.  They enjoyed the build and I appreciate the actions on the engine like the pop out wings with side panels that raise up allowing the wings to pop out.  The action is a little stiff, but satisfying.  the opening hood that becomes a mouth is also interesting, although it all comes out a little childish to me.  The whole line seems  a little childish, but it is obviously aimed at a younger audience that is addicted to screens and collecting.<br /><br />Once built they tried the app and enjoyed it well enough.

    "text": "I have to admit that on first brush I was a little disappointed with this set, I track the Lego Ideas site and I remember there being a number of appliances driven by prehistoric creatures and a big turkey on a spit etcetera.  This final set that went through the master designers dropped all of that.  But I do have to admit, I think they did a better job with the walls and roof than the original idea designer.  It really captures the house, as does the car.  The dino ribs that were featured in the opening scenes is a great idea for the set, but it is a little crude in its final appearance. I was worried about the minifigures, but in the end, I'm happy with how they look.<br /><br />The build was decently fun and took us an afternoon of building with a lot of talking.  Much of it was telling my kid about the show which he was aware of but had not really watched.  For a Gen X'er this brought back some nostalgia.  It's a nice nostalgic set which was decently designed, but it really needed a baby mammoth vacuum cleaner and a Dino to be truly great.",

This makes these cars much more playable as toys once constructed.  The build was quick - twenty minutes or so - and the finished model is pretty solid.  I'm not the biggest fan of Technic's ability to represent vehicles, I think I prefer a good classic Lego set, but the kids loved this and it is a great set for below $20.

Now I do not consider these inexpensive at $5 a figure, but he has purchased a lot of them at that price or more that did not seem to have the quality of these.  They seem small to be and they are not the highest quality, but they are acceptable quality.  There are a number of nice little accessories and all are recognizable as parts of the game.  We got a derp burger and another rather generic skin but he loves that they are unique to his collection which is now above 20.  They do display well and are lightly poseable although their hand grips are a little questionable and I've noticed that some gun barrels seem to be warped.  But my son would not allow me to give anything less than five stars for these.  For now we found the perfect stocking stuffer/small gift idea.",

These new rules allow you to steal other players cards and help judge whether you have the low hand.<br /><br />This is a fun game that you can easily teach someone in a couple minutes or at worst, one practice round of about five minutes.  The cards are good quality and we are planning on packing it on a camping trip as they are pretty thick.

I'm a little less than thrilled with the overall construction.  I think more thought could go into it as well as more details and parts.  It is basically just a few large molded pieces with a limited palette.

Coupling that with some classic Star Wars and you have a great build.<br /><br />I love the Hoth theme and it's a good selection of minifigures.  I also like the action on the ATAT when you hit the block from between its legs.  very reminiscent of Empire Strikes back.

The structure in this build is small, but still substantial.  It is not a just a front wall and a couple of side builds, it is a small but complete building.  At this price point, what you get is very impressive, and I would love to have a city of builds like this. Especially if the build design is as solid.  Especially at $25.<br /><br />The set is surprisingly filled with illustrated pieces.  Sometimes that limits using the pieces in your own constructions, but these are pretty nice and especially the large panels will be nice in other building designs.  The water reveal canvas seems a little kitchy, but again a nice detail.<br /><br />All in all, This is a great set for the price.",

For that price you should be more than just a piece of plastic with fifty cents of electronics.  At the very least it should be free ants with free shipping.

    "text": "My kids are maybe a little old for this book, but they are also old enough to truly appreciate the collection of gears that come in this set. They did build a  couple of the ideas in the book and we all found it interesting that Klutz combined paper elements into their Lego constructions.  My kids are somewhat snobby purists so they were not really for it, but I think it is a great idea for more open-minded and younger builders.<br /><br />Most of the builds are simple science tricks like making a strobing slot movie machine or a spinning image that also strobes when you spin it to blend images.  There are also the fan favorites like a catapult and a boxing robot - both of which the kids built. But mostly I think this will end up being incorporated into other home builds.  Which is fine because this truly is a great collection of parts.  We got the contraption set before and it lit up the boys creativity with all kinds of simple machines.",

This game is similar in that you are trying to find an ingredient match but on a single chip.

    "text": "I have not played the other games in this series or game designer, but I can say that it does have some rough similarities to Carcassonne, which is fantastic.  It is a more difficult than Carcassonne, but easy enough to be able to learn as you go.  And like Carcassonne this ease of learning belies a depth of strategy as you try to both build and score and block.  We have played it three times and we are still getting the strategies.<br /><br />This game left out some of our younger players and worked better with 14 and up but a fairly experience gaming tween would probably have little problem. Perhaps one age limiting aspect is that there are many, many small pieces and the game sprawls with lots of pieces to bump. The games lasted a little over an hour, it might shorten with experience of rules and strategies. Don't let the mass of pieces overwhelm you, the basic idea of the game is easy. However, there are lots of ways to score and there are great layers of strategy.  This game is not lost on tosses of the dice either.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this game.",

The premise is easy, you have to do everything with Tiny or Tinier fake hands from catching a ball to acting out charades.  The rules are simple although the rules of betting and scoring were less  than clear to us.  To be honest, we pretty much abandoned the betting and scoring of each round and just played the cards and the spinner.  In the end we just declared the kids the winners.<br /><br />Some things we learned.<br /> - Put the score card well out of harms way.  Ours was trod upon and score pieces were constantly tossed around.<br /> - You cannot hold onto a pen with the hands like a baseball bat and swing it without impaling someone with the pen<br /> - Give yourself lots of room<br /> - The Charades part went over best.<br /><br />Not sure how often this will come out, but it is a great leveler of ages and abilities and plays well in groups as long as kids are eight and up.

At $50 they are in no way cheap, but the idea truly is amazing and plays especially well in my house where my oldest son wants to be a pilot and we have an amazing array of RC planes and drones.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not all great ideas are easy to pull off.  I like that you make your own airplane, but we divvied out the papers and not every plane came out usable.  It takes a little crafting and folding ability to get it right.  But we did get one that came out perfect (mine.) The parts are small and unfortunately delicate.  I am especially worried about the prop and the connector piece that joins the cockpit to the prop.  It is a testemant to our engineering abilities to have RC controls and an engine small enough to be carried by and propel a paper airplane, but it also shows that we are testing the material and economic limits of the idea.<br /><br />We flew it a few times in the house before quickly realizing that it needed a much bigger space.  I don't think we damaged it, but we never got a chance to run it through more than a quick turn before a crash.  Our attempts at using it outside did not go well because of wind.  It wasn't until we brought it into work and flew it in a large atrium that we could really test the controls.  They were not super responsive and it seemed like we could get out of range quickly, but I can see the possibilities now.<br /><br />It is a great little idea that seems like it might need a little more work, but we have had fun with it.",

The sticker on the side has bubbles in it which looks a little shoddy and the whole thing feels a little cheap.  I wish the foam was more rigid, although that would make it harder to get all spinners to fit, but as it is, the foam seems a little cheap.  The one thing I do like about it is the clasps that hold the case shut, those seem a little more rugged and feel good when snapping the box shut.

Quickly it became more than just a pretty game.<br /><br />And it is a very pretty game.  The cards are large and well illustrated.  I like that everyone gets rules cards to reference.  The rules were less than clear, but made sense once they were deciphered.  We also went to youtube after struggling a bit and it reinforced that we were doing it right.  Perhaps that would have been a better first step.<br /><br />The game itself is easy and we played with a group from 11 to 49 and we all seemed to grasp it well enough to make sense of things.

Creating the Pom Poms is interesting and I like the little tool they give to make them.  Youngsters love wrapping the yarn around the form over and over, but it takes some adult supervision to tie off all the pieces so the poms don't fall apart.  There are a few other things that take a little bit of help, but in general, kids can make very nice looking little pets.<br /><br />We made a couple and we have plenty of materials to make more.  Also, like many Klutz kits, you have the tools and idea book to inspire many more creations with a quick trip to Hobby Lobby or Michaels for more materials.  We had several hours of entertainment with this set and I would guess we have many more to come.",

    "text": "We adore the Klutz art kits, especially the clay and eraser making kits.  We had always passed on this one because it looks like it is a decent step harder than the others and we were right.  It takes a lot more patience and hand eye coordination to sew a cute cartoon creation than it does to roll weird shaped balls of clay.  But this kit is pretty nice.  I would have given it five stars if it weren't for the clay and eraser kits which seemed easier and kept the kids engaged better.<br /><br />The kit does have all you need to make some pretty adorable creations.  Three of the four of us made donuts as our test creations and one tried the lemon.  For the most part we made decent donuts, but the lemon looks a little more like a potsticker.  We improved our stitching rather quickly, but I suspect our next creations will be considerably better.  We did augment the set with a couple of additional sewing needles and some thread to give all four of us a chance to work at the same time.  We also will be buying more felt.  There is a decent amount in the kit for an introduction, but if it takes off we will quickly run out.  (We did the same with bake clays for the clay kit.)<br /><br />I hope this takes off for a couple of the kids because the end product is very cute.",

It is larger than our two Shepherd mix dogs and may take a little thinking about where to display it.  And unfortunately it will probably be displaying rather than cuddling in its future.  It is soft, but the standing posture and legs make it difficult for cuddling.<br /><br />It is fairly lifelike, but as a nature lover, I am a little critical of the way the tines sit on the antlers and the hooves are turned a little.  The head is a little misformed for a moose, but it is completely obvious what it is.  I'm probably harsher on that than anyone but I am happy with the likeness.  I'm concerned long term about the sturdiness of the legs as I have seen a couple kids test out the moose's rideability which seems low.<br /><br />This seems like I am being critical of this plush, but its awe inspiring size and uniqueness easily make it five stars and treasured.

The colored pencils are fine, but we ended up using markers we already had.  The jewelry chains and connecting rings were nice, but still few in number.  Definitely the most exciting thing in the box were the self adhering gems, and it may be the only thing in the box that I felt neared the proper quantity.<br /><br />So it is a cute idea.

I have a fifteen year old and we recently got the newest Millenium Falcon and I had a realization that his abilities were quite beyond that set, and most sets out there, so I started looking at the expert and Technic sets. This set was perfect, it is a step up in challenge and scope from the standard sets.  It was great to watch him to tear into the bags and deliberately build.  Not only was it a little more challenging, but the scope if far more impressive.  The set itself is huge, and the architectural elements are involved although somewhat repetitive.<br /><br />We worked on this over several days and we are quite happy with the results.  The build is detailed and has some very interesting pieces.  Especially nice are the clock faces that are beautiful.  The back printing on the clear disk gives them a gem like quality, they are sharp clean and wonderfully graphic.  Absolutely beautiful.  Also impressive are the scores of micro figures (usually found in Lego games.) Long term, I'm not sure that we will ever need this many tan microfigures on any build, but interesting piece.  Also nice are the literally hundreds of architectural detail pieces from the little teeth pieces to the spires.<br /><br />We actually looked up photos of Big Ben and we are astounded at the details.  It is a wonderful representation of the end of the building.  If I had anything negative to say about the build it would be that it is a bit of a façade for that end of Westminster.  Which is forgivable given all the detail and how many pieces (and space) it would take to make the whole building.<br /><br />All in all, this was an incredible build.

The inclusion of a sound and light chip makes it more interactive than other scale models.  Repositionable wings and removable landing gear also make it fun to play with after the build.<br /><br />It is still a long way to from here to an actual scale model, but it was nice seeing my son confidently construct the model which has not happened with harder models.

For me there is an additional challenge as I am color blind and I have some issues reading the instructions.  For my son who is now 15 and graduating from the standard Lego lines (don't tell him that.)

    "text": "This is a very big gun with a very big clip (so big that you can't even fill it with the balls that come with the blaster.  So expect to want refills immediately.) It is packaged so epically, it would make an eye opening birthday or Christmas present.  Very imposing.  And even more imposing when it is unboxed.<br /><br />We are a huge Nerf gun house and we have literally dozens of guns from over the years and darts behind every couch or chair in the house, but this is our first of the guns that shoot the little balls.  Our first impressions are that they fire more consistently and don't get bent or chewed up like the darts do over a short time.  our second impression is that they sting more when you are shot.  Enough so that there are now house rules about not shooting people with it.<br /><br />If it were not for Nerf, I don't think my kids would know what C or D batteries are. (in this case D) It is a minor investment to fill the gun with batteries but we have not seen any degredation in the workings so far after almost a week of regular daily play, although none of the battles were sustained.<br /><br />All in all, we are very, very happy with this gun.  They kids were in awe of it in unboxing and in test shooting.  It has caused a few arguments about who gets to use it, followed by a bigger argument about who can be shot with it.  Despite these small arguments, I'm still glad we got it.",

If you were new to the hobby and didn't know about trimming the controls, you would find the device frustrating at best, if not unusable. Ours came with a strong forward drift that would have been very hard to overcome. And if you were familiar with trimming the controls, you are still on for a challenge that will take a few rereads to figure it out.<br /><br />Ok, manual rant over, remember that this is a sub $50 quadcopter. For the price I am impressed with it. It is entry level and is rugged enough to take some abuse, but it is not designed to last forever. It's flight is fairly steady and once trimmed properly the hover function is fairly good. The controls are ok. I appreciate the one button take offs and landings which is easy for novices once they are calm enough to remember to push them.<br /><br />The camera is ok, remember again the whole copter is $50 so don't expect go pro quality... It is fun and the kids have enjoyed exploring the world from above. They enjoyed shooting and filming from above. Note you will need a micro SD. (Not included, remember, sub $50) it is a fun although toyish.<br /><br />All in all, it is fun. Perhaps it is not the easiest quad we've had out of the box, but once tweaked it has been stable and at a price point that is decent for novices.",

But this is such a well engineered and detailed set that my fifteen year old wasn't even grudging when he said, this is a really good set.<br /><br />And he's right, the detail on this set is super impressive. My son loves it for what seems like very authentic design from a war historian rather than a gamer, so maybe a fan of COD would like it even more.<br /><br />This is a very challenging build, filled with small parts and unlike Lego that pre bags parts so you can open a single bag to do the first couple pages of instructions, mega blocks has you open 80% of the bags for the first few pages. You end up with an impressive pile of pieces out there. Also unlike Lego, mega blocks will create molded pieces specific to a model so realism can be pushed farther than Lego does. In this set, the body is filled with parts that are not just molded to shape but also in color to seem camouflaged or dirty from use. This truly lends a wonderful realism to the model. We also appreciated that markings are screen printed onto pieces rather than using stickers. Kudos for doing that it makes it feel like a quality set.<br /><br />I do notice a bit more brittleness in the blocks and brick for brick the quality does not seem to match lego, but I can do little but rave over this set. It is beautiful, it took my son and I working together to get this done in several hours. And once done, this is a beautiful set for display.<br /><br />Well done Mega Block, you are doing what I thought was impossible, you are winning us over from Lego.<br /><br />*** additional<br /><br />My son wanted me to mention that the instructions were hard, I would use challenging.

    "text": "What a great creative art toy.  You can do literally anything with this and takes your sketches off the paper and into three dimensions.  I am amazed at the ways the kids put this into practice, and it kept them engrossed for hours with only a couple squabbles over people hogging this color or that.  I'll get more into what we did below. But first, What you get and How this works.<br /><br />This product is a hardening gel that can be squeezed into shapes using plastic forms.  There are several forms that come with the kit, a flat sheet of plastic and a couple rounded forms for creating spherical shapes.  The flat clear piece is great for tracing images so even young kids can achieve the shapes they desire.  Also, we used it to make other curves to help flesh out animal shapes, but that proved a little more difficult.<br /><br />Once you have drawn your shapes with one of the gel pens, you can use the UV flashlight to harden the pieces to make them retain the shapes you want.  Then you can peel them off the plastic forms or sheet and cement elements together into three dimensional structures.  The possibilities are endless and only limited by creativity.  Our kids started out by tracing the provided dinosaurs and moved on to tracing other dinos from various books until they had a small forest of dinos and trees.<br /><br />Warnings and caveats:  I'm a little leery of the chemically nature of this toy.  There are warnings to avoid skin contact in light.  This put me a little on edge and I wanted to supervise our 8 through 14 year olds to make sure it was not getting on skin or other stuff.  Also, this does take a bit of artistic ability. It can be as free form as you want it to be, but we did have some frustration when younger kids could not recreate the stuff the older kids were building.  But for the most part it was very conducive to creativity.<br /><br />Also, the end products are a little sticky.  So they don't seem like you can play with your creations, but you can make wonderful visual art.  We have a nice little dino diorama on our book shelf now and the kids seem pretty proud of it. The inks are also a little messy, so make sure your in a cleanable area.<br /><br />Personally, I think this is one of the most wonderfully novel and creative ideas I've seen in a while.  I will be picking up some for the kids on my Christmas list, and look forward to refilling our supply.",

    "text": "This was a wonderfully cute and unique game. We played it with a diverse age range and everyone loved it. The youngest were super sad when bedtime came and we had to call it a night and the adults were tempted for one more round.<br /><br />The game play is deceptively very simple. Despite a lot of vigilance it was amazing how people were still able to get winks by us with regularity. The cards and pieces work great and the game flow is easy to follow. Basically it is kind of like go fish except there is incentive for both sides pair up with their random partners. You announce a card you are trying for, then it is your secret partners job to let you know that they have it. If their secret message is not noticed you each get a point when the round ends. If it is intercepted, the interceptor gets both points.<br /><br />You decide the numbers based on a six by six grid of randomly placed cards. Simply select a card not in your hand and place your marker on it. Then look for your secret partner to ingle that they have the match, while also looking to intercept other sereptitious communication. It's that easy, yet super fun and with parity from eight to eighty. Great game.",

This is a lot like Spot it in that regards, where a 7 year old can compete fairly well with a 47 year old once everyone knows what they are looking for.  The reaching for the bell is kinetic enough to engage kids to make them want to be the first to slam the ringer, and the rules are so easy they can immediately be digested. The action is fast and again engaging, and we had a lot of laughs with the came, and surprisingly few injuries and fights.<br /><br />The game in its simplest form is almost too easy, but it lends itself to more and more levels of complexity. There are three variables, numbers, color (8 or more) and a shape. You can play complex combos like match a shape and a number, or two numbers must add up to ten and there needs to be a match. Instant ring it and visually similar don't ring it cards cause quick victories as well as quick penalties.<br /><br />This is a perfect game to pull out for some quick games. The container holds all the pieces and makes it wonderfully portable.  The parts are decent quality and I expect it to hold up well.",

    "text": "Well, I'm having a hard time fully loving this toy.  And frankly it is for the same reasons I am often disappointed with Hot Wheels sets like this.  Like most, this is a beautifully sculpted model.  I love that it represents the scene of Jakku that appeared in the Star Wars trailer.  That is one of the most amazing movie visuals I have ever seen.  Also, the included vehicle is amazing, much like every other hot wheels vehicle.  In this case, the Falcon looks awesome, has a nice weight to it and exudes quality.<br /><br />Where this toy fails is where many of these fail. The actual action of the &#34;game&#34; is...well horrendous.  In this case, you basically have a button masher where you slam a control stick back and forth which puts the Falcon into a crazed 360 then slams down possibly knocking off an X Wing figure.  Now in part, this is decently thought out idea.  The X Wings circle slightly faster than the Falcon, so if you maintain low level flight they will bonk you in the rear. And this works well with the 360.  If you time your loop correctly, you not only avoid being bonked in the rear, but you can turn the tables and knock the X Wing off it's mount.  And there you have it, the entire game in one sentence.  I seriously doubt this will have any lasting appeal to anyone. The set illicits some excitement at unboxing and set up, a little more while mastering the concept, but that's about it.<br /><br />The biggest takeaway from the game is a nice model of the Millenium Falcon.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Great Miniature Millenium Falcon<br />+ Nice sculpture of the surface of Jakku<br />+ Nice sound effects<br /><br />Cons<br />- The whole thing whips around during and after the loop<br />- The game is pretty one dimensional<br />- Probably will not have much longevity of excitement",

The changing rules make it possible to have victory snatched from you at the turn of a card, or suddenly find yourself holding the winning hand.  I have never played anything like it.<br /><br />We have played a number of games now and the kids truly love it.  I can see how there could be a whole fleet of games created around this concept.  For this one, there are some very Batman specific rules that fans of the franchise should like.  For example, there is an Archam Asylum rule card that contains the villains in play.  There is a rich collection of characters and equipment from the Batman world, which I am not a expert at, but I appreciate how they work the storyline into the game.  Much of it must have been specific rules which change the game at least a little from the original game.<br /><br />The art work is great, the cards and game are easy to read and understand, the quality is nice.  All in all this is a really great little game that can be learned and enjoyed in a single hand.  And due to the fluctuation in the rules, no game is the same and I have yet to discover a general strategy.  You just have to play the cards as they lie.<br /><br />Great Game",

    "text": "We are a nerf gun fighting family, so we were very happy to try out a new nerf gun.  Unfortunately, it seems to have broken rather quickly.  It is still usable, but there is a little stop pin that pops up into the action lever and stops you from being able to draw the sling shot back.  My guess is that there was something that retracted that piece on the draw back, but now we need to push the pin down while drawing back the slingshot so you need two hands and a lot of concentration to get the blaster to fire.<br /><br />Had that part been working, we are happy with the distance and accuracy of the darts.  They are propelled well by the slingshot action and if it was not such a pain to get the device to fire, we would probably like it a lot.  However it does not have a high rate of fire, even if it was working and requires a lot of manual loading per shot.<br /><br />The other feature of this set is the secret message dart which turned out to be a little gimmicky.  The dart works on a red dot filter that camoflauges the message.  In our case there was a message preprinted on the dart and when you slip the dart into a red transparent tube, the red dots disappear and you get a simple one word message.  We imagined the nerf equivalent to carrier pigeons to send messages covertly during battles, instead it is kind of a gimmick.<br /><br />It will go into the arsenal, but we were not overwhelmed with this device.  Especially since ours seems to have broken some how.<br /><br />Pro<br />+ Good power for long shots<br />+ Nice Accuracy<br />+ Easy assembly<br /><br />Cons<br />- Ours kind of broke<br />- low rate of fire<br />- Message dart is a low use gimmick",

They do not follow international borders very faithfully and randomly cut larger countries into random parts.  Pieces that include only one country do not resemble the country at all.  the eastern united states is a irregular rectangle that appears to miss New England and average out Florida.  France is a strange amporphous shape.  Canada and Russia are random blotches of non interconnecting shapes.<br /><br />I like the story that the first puzzle was a US map cut into pieces in a classroom to teach geography.  This could have been similar except that the countries are so crudely hacked in shapes.  But it does give an idea of location and cultural icons like the great wall of china, russian dolls, local animals are located on the map.  I was very impressed that the Great Barrier Reef made the map as an entity.  But it could have been so much better in the way it was handled.<br /><br />As for how it was made, the pieces are small and found to be easy to misplace.

The sets just don't seem to have the quality that seemed to go into the Star Wars toys in the late 70's and 80's.  So I was shocked when my boys showed a ton of interest in the toys. Even the army men type figurines seemed of suspect quality.<br /><br />The fact that this as a &#34;remote control&#34; vehicle capable of gunning down figures made this very interesting to them.  I put remote control in quotes because the controls are limited,  basically forward and reverse with a simultaneous twisting.  So turning is accomplished by a series of forward and backward thrusts.  It is awkward and to me, kind of lame.  But boys enjoyed the interactivity.  the third control is to pop the front of the star destroyer open to allow the fourth control to eject balls.  This has been plenty fun for the boys, but I'm disappointed that you cannot reclose the destroyer (other than manually).<br /><br />It is good that they took basic army men and found a way to interactively knock them down.  But it's just an inelegant solution with a clumsy remote control.  It is fine for a kids toy, but definitely less than expertly designed and manufactured.<br /><br />The pieces are collectible and we are picking up the Endor expansion pack because my youngest loves ewoks.  So there is some collectability.  I think I'm coming off pretty harsh, bottom line is that the kids have enjoyed playing with this set, I'm just kind of underwhelmed.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ The toys are based on Star Wars<br />+ &#34;Remote Control&#34; aspect brings interest<br />+ Somewhat Collectible<br /><br />Cons<br />- Quality seems like a secondary thought<br />- Controls are difficult<br />- Overall, just a little underwhelming",

Schleich's tended to be static, less detailed and just generally clumsier reproductions.  This has drastically changed with this new series of dinosaurs.<br /><br />The addition of the moveable jaw and finer details has really brought the Schleich dino line up several notches.  We still favor the Papos but the details in the facial features on this T Rex are great.  The Jaw action is good, but the teeth are a still a little crude in their molding.  The body position is gook, coloration is somewhat bold with the tannish scales.  But all in all this is a great figure.

    "text": "I have a thirteen year old with fairly serious interest in RC planes.  We have got him several entry level planes and he is growing as a RC pilot.  It has been great to watch him gain confidence and competence flying. I was very happy to get this RC flyer as another vehicle for him to cut his teeth on and it really seems to be doing exactly what I was hoping it would - hone his feel  for flying.<br /><br />I would compare this vehicle to the rather simple (and rather cheap) air hogs RC toys.  They do fly and use a remote but they are more a general toy than a serious hobbyist plane.  However, I was pretty happy with the flight and controls of this plane.  in many ways it is even a simpler starter plane than the Hobby Zone Champ (which is an amazing entry level RC Plane.)<br /><br />For the Fire Shot, everything is controlled by the twin motors.  Lift is generated by the entire body, and ascent and descent are controlled by throttle, rising when you add power, descending when you throttle back.  Side to side is controlled by the power given to the left or right props.  This does make flight dependant on two good engines.  There is a trim setting to finely balance the engines for straight flight.<br /><br />The materials are ok and it is a shapely, elegant flying wing.  The body is a compressed styrofoam that is lightweight while still rugged enough to survive a few encounters with the ground.  The styrofoam does show abraisions and wrinkles from impact, but held it's shape enough to keep it airworthy. I think it will last a while. The engines were good and with very minor trim adjustments, it flew true. Spare propellers are provided which is nice.  The remote is OK but not the greatest quality.<br /><br />Flight was faster than my son was used to and needed faster reaction times.  It seems to have a bit of a learning crew, and it did stall fairly easily when pushed too hard into ascent, but flight was very stable.  The 50 minute charge time was a little long for an eight minute flight.  Especially without the option to swap out batteries.  We have a couple of planes so at least we could switch out to other, charged airplanes and rotate the charges.  Otherwise charging and syncing were without problems.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Simple Controls<br />+ Decent Materials<br />+ Rigid foam<br />+ Decent intro to RC planes<br />+ Sleek Design<br /><br />Cons<br />- Single enbedded battery, can not be hot swapped<br />- 50 minute charge time for 5-10 minute flight<br />- Materials show aesthetic effects of ground strikes<br /><br />Summary: All in all, it was nice different feeling plane that added interest to the flight trip we took it on.  We did not try out the amphibious qualities but hope to soon. There is no price at this time, but if it is in the ballpark of the Air Hogs ($50-$80, I feel this is a better value and probably a better handling vehicle. I don't know that I would pick it over something like the Hobby Zone RT Champ at $89.",

    "text": "I was actually pretty surprised how well this game was designed and manufactured.  The game itself is extremely easy.  In three sentences, you have one dice that you can use to move or gather money.  The winner is decided on who gets the most coins.  So the trade off is to gather coin, or run from the ever advancing shark.<br /><br />So the game is easy, but the real wow factor for the kids playing this game is the gameboard itself.  You run down a gang plank, running from shark fin that breaks through the decking and tripping spring loaded shark heads that bursts through the dock plankings.  The player pieces are four uniquely molded plastic pirates with lots of character.  All in all, the &#34;game board&#34; itself is enough to engage children.  We played with a wide age range from 8 to 46 and it was fun for all, although one teen found that he could hold the dice to allow the shark to knock out the slower pieces.  But with a good crowd, the shark keeps the players moving to save their own skins if nothing else.<br /><br />We were happily surprised with the quality and fun gameplay of this game.  It is a younger game for sure, probably 6-9 would be a good range, but it was fun for all.  I'm not sure how long it will be played, but has held the attention of groups of kids many times.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Super Easy Rules<br />+ Super Easy Set up<br />+ Very well designed, and manufactured, game board<br />+ Great, Molded Pirate Player Pieces<br />+ Loads of Fun<br /><br />Cons<br />- The system can be gamed by someone purposely holding the dice.",

    "text": "Out of the box this toy really impresses.  The idea of taking your pet dog for a walk, and interactively playing with it made it an instant hit. We spent time play with it, getting it to walk forward which was great for the 10 feet to the wall.  We played with the interactive voice commands which were great.  We downloaded the app and played with connecting to the little guy and played the rather simplistic games, and all was great.<br /><br />At least it was great until we got to the end of new tricks.  The excitement waned when we got to the end of the tricks and the second time through was less exciting.  Sadly with most electronic stuffed animals, what you end up with is an uncuddly shelf piece. This one does have some advancements over other walking animals, like the remote control leash.  However it would have been exponentially better if you could control the walking left and right.  then you could really take it for a walk around the house and obstacles. As it is, to get maximum fun you put it on the longest straight away you can find and gently follow it.  Otherwise it is a little tippy and can fall over.<br /><br />The App has a lot of potential.  Right now it is slick and professional with lots of transitional animation and nice clean graphics.  Aesthetically it's beautiful.  And the interaction brings a lot to the dog. One of the greatest things about Apps in general is that they can continue to be expanded and with a decent game platform, it can keep kids engaged with the FurReal Friends for a long time.  Right now there is a point system where you can unlock items.  This kind of game play really does have the potential of giving this toy legs.  Right now the games we can play are pretty simplistic, but the simulated pet care is intriguing, and my kids really liked that part.<br /><br />All in all we are very happy with the toy, but the excitement really dropped off after an initial burst of excitement.",

    "text": "bin of We are a huge Playmobil family and picked up every pirate and sailing ship that came out.  We have marveled over every detail in every set we've gotten and have an ever growing bin of Playmobil.  So my boys are connoisseurs who can give an instant critique.<br /><br />They did like the details like the hose and equipment.  They enjoyed the basics of the truck, but within a few minutes came \"This truck seems kind of cheap.\" And I have to admit that it doesn't seem quite up to the quality we have come to expect.  The details are there, but the feel is not quite what I would have expected.  The moving parts, ladder and wheels etcetera seem less rugged. To get the driver in and out of the cab, you must pop off the roof which is held on by plastic tabs that I fear might be too brittle to last. But saying that, this is a decent toy and I'm sure will get played with.<br /><br />And actually the one thing that really seems \"cheaper\" than I am used to with Playmobil is the use of stickers.  Playmobil has always had details like cast plastic grills and graphic elements are factory painted on.  On this vehicle, the details are printed on stickers and applied.  Our Playmobil stuff is often taken into the bathtub.  This is impossible for this truck since the stickers will quickly dissolve in water and look awful.<br /><br />The lights and siren are a nice touch.  They bring additional realism and the siren was surprisingly mellow.  We've had our share of toys that have been banned on road trips or had to be put into time out, but this one is reasonably quiet for play in the next room.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ It's Playmobil<br />+ Lights are nice<br />+ Siren is not loud<br />+ Interactive play<br />+ Multi-Cultural<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not quite up to Playmobil's usual quality<br />- Questionable tabs on the cab's roof<br />- Stickers - easily the single biggest reason why this seems \"cheap\" from Playmobil",

    "text": "As a caveat, we are a Nerf gun family. We have spent a lot of time in the basement setting up forts, donning safety glasses, and trying to nail each other with darts.  So we were a little skeptical about a &#34;copycat&#34; gun system just as we are of Lego rip offs.  But this gun had a few happy surprises, like the way the darts stick to the special target and the incredible range we were getting on the darts.<br /><br />Quality - the plastic seems a little more brittle than Nerf guns, and in general, I don't feel that they are quite up to the same level of quality.  However, they have stood up to a lot of firing by the boys and are still going. And the darts are rigid and seem to be holding up to the abuse better than the foam Nerf darts do.<br /><br />Aim - These have fairly decent aiming and you can consistently hit the target if not the bullseye. During battles they are fairly deadly, especially since the dates have a little more zing.<br /><br />Fun factor - It's up there with Nerf.  We don't include them in our battles because they have a little more zing than we want. They are good for target practice although since the darts only stick to the magic targets, you are limited with what you can aim at to get a satisfying hit. The fact that this set comes with two guns is pretty key to fun. Shields are a little gimmicky, but the boys love to pop them open and closed.<br /><br />Value - They are in line with the Nerf guns.  We have an arsenal of Nerf and many refills of Nerf darts so we will probably not expand into the Boomco system.  Also, the refills of darts are fairly expensive, but if they end up like Nerf, you should be able to shop clearances and sales to refill.<br /><br />Summary - They are not bad guns, they just aren't Nerf.  The boys have enjoyed playing with these, but I think that barring an amazing design on something from Boomco, we will stick with Nerf.",

I'm impressed with who engaged the kids get.<br /><br />However, I've always had a huge tub of Brio and Thomas tracks at home and I see a few disadvantages of this set.  The worst thing is that you pretty much only have one workable configuration.  So unless you have other sets, it does not lend itself to creative track designs. Because of the uniqueness of these pieces, I think it would be hard to incorporate it into other designs unless you have a lot of them.  Also, the tracks don't seem to be as interlocking as the wooden tracks and have a slightly cheap plastic feel in comparison, and the train does occasionally jump track.

They really do work like slot cars, but with a wide open track.<br /><br />However, after racing for a little while, my kids started getting frustrated that the cars would occasionally go into a spin and shoot off the track or end up heading the wrong direction, which they would quickly notice and reverse, but it was frustrating when your car would spin and start going the  wrong way. Often you would see a car fly off the track and be told to return the car to the track.  It happens enough to be intrusive to the game.<br /><br />The battling aspect of the game is great.  The cars do seem to have a sense of aim when firing.  But we did run into a little trouble.  My older son ended up playing with his car for an hour, building up points and adding upgrades to his car.

The kids loved the set and played with it for hours after the opened it and they have returned to them several times in the next week. It was a real winner in the make the kids happy. I am very happy to see how much the kids have enjoyed the set.  However, I have a few issues with the track and performance where I could see some improvement.<br /><br />  Quality.<br /><br />The cars themselves seem pretty solid.  We have wound the ratchets up well over a hundred times a piece and the car's performance seems unchanged, which was a concern.  The cars also seem to be pretty rugged as they have hit a number of obstacles with no apparent harm.<br /><br />Where the quality is a little lacking is in the track.  The track is made out of a thin stiff plastic that seems like it might now hold up well.  I noticed that other reviewers mention the risk of injuries or cuts which is interesting because that is exactly what I thought of when I was setting up the track, but I have checked all the edges and our set does not seem to have any real risk of cuts.  The track is usable, and the stacking design is nice and organized, but the materials are a little on the cheap side for the raceway itself.  Checkered flag function is nice although one of or flags is slow to rise.<br /><br />I think it was pretty telling when my oldest boy said, \"Lets get more of the cars, we don't need a track really, but I would like the other cars.\"  He even said that the cars were well made.<br /><br />  Playability.<br /><br />The one thing the cars lack is a little torque.  The are slow to get up to speed but once they get up to speed they race pretty well.  However, in the second or two that they are getting up to speed, they are prone to getting stuck, especially when one of the wheels contacts the side of the track or the other car. The causes a lot of false starts when a car's wheel rubs on the track wall and the car never gets going.<br /><br />Also, the obstacles seem a little bothersome.  Mostly they cause the cars to lodge together or jump track.  Which does add some variation, but at times a little frustration.<br /><br />The Ratchet action is great.  Our five year old quickly learned to ratchet the cars up and could play completely independently.  He quickly mastered lining the car halves up and stopping when the ratchet clicks.  It is quick to prime the cars with potential energy and the single button control could hardly be simpler except that there are two states, one that allows ratcheting and one that doesn't.  Not a big thing but sometimes you forget to hit the button before winding the car back up.<br /><br />All in all I am very, very happy with this set. It has captured my boys interested and allowed them (5 and 10) to play together at something.  Sometimes this age difference makes that a challenge.",

    "text": "I don't completely understand the attraction for my son, but the pillow pet has a much stronger place in his heart than any other stuffed animal.  We have had a series of them which have been drug everywhere.  I was really excited when I saw there were book combos.  Any chance to make my kids readers is a good thing.  The book itself is fine.  It does have a substantial amount of words and takes a while to get through which is nice.  It makes a very bedtime story, although it is not Ernest Hemingway or Emily Bronte.  The illustrations are decent although the characters are very noticeably pillow pets, with probably makes my little one connect to the book better, but the animals look a little strange and boxy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this set to anyone with kids in the two and a half to five year old range.  At least in our experience, kids bond to them quickly and the pillow pets end up being kind of stuffed security blankets that make going to bed a little easier - unless of course you leave them at Grandmas.",

    "text": "This toy gave my 10 year old an incredible holy cow moment when we opened the package from Amazon.  He then proceeded to spend time over three days mastering the transformations from Semi to Optimus Prime.<br /><br />I defer to his rating of four stars.  He really likes it but noted that the transformation is kind of hard and at one point the arm popped off while torquing it to stow the arm.  This is not a easy transformation, it is kind of like refolding a map, it takes a little thinking and the pieces don't seem to go back quite where they were.  However, the overall design is an impressive feat of engineering.<br /><br />My son was very impressed that he mastered this toy despite being listed 3 out of 3 for difficulty. It takes 22 steps to transform the semi to optimus, 20 steps to turn the trailer into body armor, and additional 9 steps just to get the action figure into the body armor.  the instructions are a double sided poster with scores of steps.<br /><br />He demoed the toy for an hour and was very excited, but when he found that it was $70 or so he was shocked.  We talked about it for a while and he decided that dollar for dollar it was probably better off with a good lego set. Since the demo it has sat pretty much unused.  He still likes it, but it does not get the day to day use of many of his other toys.<br /><br />So all in all, it is pricey, well designed but somewhat difficult to transform.  I see it more as a fan boy collectible than a day to day toy.  Impressive, but not overly engaging.",

Contacted Mobo via email and 3 days they responded sending me a manual, nothing else. I emailed again 10 days later and called to find out where my missing parts were and they arrived a 2 days later. When I got around to finish putting the bike together, a rear tire was flat, pumped it up, and went flat again. Sent an email and took 10 days for them to send a replacement tube. Rode bike once. Same tire went flat again. Sent new email on 9/25/15 and it has been 7 days with no response. I have a $500 piece of junk in my garage.",

It arrived broken -- one of the paw pad sensors doesn't work unless you squeeze it just right, with two fingers. In the past Fisher Price has given me fantastic service, so I'm sure they'll take care of that problem when I get around to calling.<br /><br />The really terrible thing about this puppy is that when you hit a sensor, the toy stops whatever it was doing and starts a new thing. The sensors are super sensitive, and will go off if you just brush up against the toy. My daughter wants to hear the songs all the way through, and sing along, but of course she wants to be able to hold or touch the puppy at the same time. So the song stops, then it takes like five tries to cycle around to the song she wants, then she hugs the puppy and the song stops again. After about ten minutes of this she was in tears. I've never see my little girl so distraught -- she's not a kid who gets discouraged or cries much, but she just collapsed into my arms in tears of frustration. I felt awful for her.<br /><br />Other things I don't like about it:<br />1. The \"this little piggy\" chant is turned into \"this little puppy,\" so now my daughter has started saying that, and I prefer the classic rhyme.<br />2. There's a whole part that says \"blue ear,\" \"yellow foot,\" \"green hand,\" when you hit those body parts. But because it cuts off when you hit the sensors, it can sound like \"blue -- foot,\" when the foot is actually yellow. My daughter repeated \"blue foot,\" and I had to correct her.<br />3. It says \"I love you\". I generally don't like inanimate objects saying they love my child.<br /><br />If Fisher Price just made the slight change of having this puppy complete what he's doing before starting the next activity, we'd probably love it!",

    "text": "I completely missed out on this elementary and middle school game, I was born to early. The Oregon Trail is a series of educational computer games. The first game was originally developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and produced by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) in 1974. The original game was designed to teach school children about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail. The player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding a party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley via a covered wagon in 1848.  I am loving this toy for 3 reasons, first it's a toy, second I love history and most important I too traveled West from the Eastern US and live on the Oregon Coast just west of the Willamette Valley. I love the retro graphics!! I think this would be an ideal gift for anyone who was in elementary or middle school from 1978 to 1998. The only thing I would improve is make the screen twice as large.",

It was a perfect ice breaker when making new friends thrown together and looking for something to do. The soon to be out of their teens got a lot of laughs at the added element of the timer.<br /><br />Mattel needs to get a focus group together to come up with simpler things to draw - they need to adhere to the KISS advisory - maybe even have a few versions: kids, teens, adults and classic for the 55+ set. I advised my boy to have some fun writing over the cards with things more appropriate for their age group.",

I really loved it that the cards were so large.<br /><br />Even better it can played as teams (Number of Players/Teams: 2 to 6). There are also 'guess-my-answer' questions where you try to guess what another player's answer would be to a question, like \"who would you want to go on an adventure with?\" from a selection of 4 characters on the face of the card.<br /><br />Cranking it up a notch the players use wager coins (kind of like the Final Jeopardy question on the TV show Jeopardy) where the more confident you are in the answer the higher you would wager.<br /><br />FYI it comes with a free APP that has trivia you can play alone or with friends.<br /><br />** Update 8/31/2014 -  Still tons of fun after playing it almost every day since we got it (it helps that it is still summer vacation - lol).",

You down load the app to your touch and once it down loads you are ready to play with the neat things in the box.<br /><br />You bring an image up on your touch. You then use the app and the pen to cut out or crop pieces of an image or draw on the image.  Create morphing effects, like stretching & melting with the morphing tool. Design backgrounds to paste your picture on or you can paste the image on a background from the app.  Use the stamp for general silliness. Then keep it all in a provided storage pouch.",

    "text": "This set is definitely not just for children. Adults who love miniatures will also find delight in it. The furniture is all high quality and very well made. Most of them are individually wrapped. Some are wrapped as sets. The box has a cubby for each of the wrapped items just in case you want to keep them safe until you have a proper place to display them. The details are just stunning. The fabric on the upholstered pieces feels great. Some drawers pull out and there are individual shelves in the china cabinet. Overall, this is a wonderful set. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",

The provided round chips are a little flimsy.  The divided box sections lack dividers between the main tiles and the chips in the center.

I selected this one because of the size - a little bigger than a typical travel set - and so far I have been very pleased with it.<br /><br />Most travel sets I have seen and used have been small and of lower quality. There's nothing wrong with that, as you would not want to take an expensive set on the road unless traveling for the purpose of playing chess. This is a larger set, measuring 15\"x15\", which is suitable for play in most situations. It is not a tournament-sized set by any means, though.<br /><br />I was mildly surprised by the fit and finish of this set. I say mildly because this is a more expensive set than many other travel sets, so I was expecting this to be a step up from typical travel sets though I wasn't expecting this much of a step up... The pieces are well made without rough spots or cuts and they're finished nicely so they're smooth. The board is also well-made and has a very smooth surface so that pieces can be slid without difficulty instead of having to pick them up and set them down again.<br /><br />Also included is a set of checkers so that either game can be played on the board.<br /><br />This is a better travel set than most, and it is larger than most I have seen too. It is well made and priced reasonably with the quality.",

I selected this one with those thoughts in mind. It has proven to be a good game that we all like. It bears some similarities to Apples to Apples, another game we like but usually play with larger groups.<br /><br />The object of the game is simple: using the cards available to you, select the one that most closely matches the two subject cards in some way – or at least is most likely to be selected by the judge. If you are familiar with Apples to Apples this game is very similar in concept except that you're matching against two cards instead of one.<br /><br />Game play is as fast or as slow as you want it to be. And, depending on how you play, this can generate a lot of laughter and/or a lot of competition.<br /><br />The only reservation I have with this game is that there are limited numbers of cards, both subject and matching. I am hopeful that expansion packs will be available eventually.<br /><br />This is a fun family game that has a ring of familiarity to it. It's great for small groups and for us it gets us laughing. The rules are easy to understand and game play can be fast or slow. Based on our experience with it, this one's easy to recommend.",

    "text": "As I kid I always liked models. I also liked erector sets. Those two things consumed a good chunk of my childhood free-time. This model is a bit of a hybrid between the two and is a lot of fun. That said, it might not be quite age appropriate for the lower end of the recommended age range.<br /><br />This is a nice assbly-required tractor kit, made of plastic but with lots of moving parts. It takes some time to assemble but the end product is a workable toy that is well made and fun to play with. It has elements of an erector set - tools for assembly and plenty of nuts and bolts to fasten things together.<br /><br />It is the sheer number of parts that give me pause when I see that this is recommended for children starting at age 5. Children that young are arguably going to struggle with not losing some of the fasteners, and there is the potential for limited patience. For children that are at the younger end of the range, it is probably best to work with them and make this a parent-child project. I suppose that's the point, though many children enjoy working independently and figuring things out on their own.<br /><br />This is a nice assembly-required toy and it will definitely consume some time, both during assembly and after. I like the design and I like the way it comes together. I do question the age range, and that may be me being overly cautious.",

    "text": "I have loved chess for many years and I look for chess-related things that will work well for my family and me. A travel set is one of those things. I selected this set with the thought of it working well in the car. It's a decent little set and I like it but there is some room for improvement, especially when considering the price.<br /><br />This is a fairly straightforward set - wooden peg pieces that attach to the peg board and hold well enough to survive some jostling while traveling. It's easy enough to see and it is large enough that the pieces can be moved without too much trouble. So far, so good.<br /><br />The board itself is a cheap, heavy card stock insert that is attached to the inside of the lid. This is all right and is an efficient way to use the space. However, for the cost of this set ($25 as I write this) I would have preferred to see a removable plastic or particle board of some kind rather than a paper-based board.<br /><br />The set comes with a simple rulebook to get a beginner started. It's a nice addition and is better than the basic instructions often printed on a single sheet of paper or the lid of a box. There's a fair amount of humor in the writing which makes it a more interesting read.<br /><br />This is not as bad set at all and it will be fun when traveling. I think there should be a more substantial board in the box, though, considering the price of the overall set.",

I selected this little throw toy for this environment. So far, it has been well received and has become part of the mix. It's not perfect, and it probably missed the target audience a little, but for office props it works for me.<br /><br />This is a very small finned football, about the size of a grapefruit though not round. It is soft and easy to grip but it is not as soft as a Nerf ball or a foam rubber ball with no fins. That's all right for us, but it's something to keep in mind. It is weighted so that over distance the head should drop and the fins point up towards the end of the flight time.<br /><br />Because it is soft and pliable it is well suited for smaller kids, though larger children probably will find this to be too small. Indoors, though, it has enough weight to do damage if it hits something fragile like a vase or flower pot, so some caution should be used indoors.<br /><br />Over farther distances, it doesn't fly quite as straight as I'd expect. I think the size and weight might be a little off?<br /><br />This is a fun finned football toy and I like it as do my office mates. It's fun to toss around (carefully in the office) and it has a nice feel to it. I question, though, if it should have been bigger or if there is a problem with the balance that could be improved.",

The ring I received fits properly. There's really little more to add on that.<br /><br />This is a nice-looking ring and it matches the description picture exactly. I went with the black groove style and it is a very conservative, unassuming ring that does not draw attention to itself which is what I wanted.<br /><br />The spinning portion did not spin smoothly on mine when I first received it, feeling like there was a rough spot on one or both of the parts. As I have messed with it, it has gotten better and now it feels smooth. It is possible that there was a small piece of debris caught in between the parts; I will keep messing with it.<br /><br />It is surprisingly satisfying to mess with this ring, too. I have other fidget toys that do more and are more expensive, but this ring is just as satisfying and it costs a lot less.<br /><br />For the price this is a very good spinner ring. The ring does spin as expected and it is satisfying to mess with it. It doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself and it is easy to play with it without being distracting. My particular ring caught slightly in the beginning, and I suspect it was manufacturing debris. Regardless, it's hard to argue with the price.",

I selected this thinking it would be similar to those blister-type pop toys. It's not, but it's still an effective toy for stress relief and focus. It's possibly a little too noisy for a meeting, though.<br /><br />At a glance this thing looks like the sections might come apart. They do not. Instead, this is an accordion-style fidget toy that you pull and push on the ends to make it expand and contract. It can be bent, twisted slightly, partially expanded and completely expanded. The colors are soothing and the tactile feel is nice.<br /><br />When expanding the toy the sections are not silent. They're not loud, but they have a noticeable popping sound that's lost in the background in a normal environment but draws attention to itself in a more quiet area like a meeting room. It can be expanded more quietly with a little thought. If in an area where making a small amount of noise is acceptable, the sound is satisfying.<br /><br />As I write this, this toy is close to $30 which seems high. This is really my only reservation with it.<br /><br />I like this toy and will get some good use out of it. I usually mess with it when I am sitting at my desk and I want to sit still.

We're always looking for ways to bring all of us together for communication and fun, and this game makes a valiant effort to accomplish both. It's certainly not a bad game, but it is not our cup of tea.<br /><br />This idea behind this game, when boiled down and simplified as much as possible, is to communicate via pictures and Venn diagrams to get the other players to guess hidden words. By placing the art cards on the various zones of the Venn diagrams in front of them the clue giver communicates that the picture may relate to one, two or all three of the words.<br /><br />The rules seem complex at first but the game is actually fairly simple to understand if you slow down and read the rules carefully. I had to read through twice before everything clicked and I understood. That's not a bad thing but it should be noted that this is not so simple a game that can be learned in 5 minutes.<br /><br />We ran into problems with the art cards. The cards themselves are very artistic and there's a lot going on with them - too much, actually, and they complicate the game because they're too busy and have many irrelevant details. I supposed that's part of the game's challenge, picking out details that are important and dumping what isn't, but it is frustrating for us and we ended up stopping gameplay when frustrations got too high.<br /><br />Perhaps with a larger group in a party setting this might prove to be a much more fun game, but in our small family setting it wasn't as much fun as we'd hoped. The game isn't all that difficult to understand and the play is reasonably straightforward, but the art clue cards are overkill and made the game much more effort than just a casual fun activity.",

However, some of the daily activities are less practical than others and really require getting out of the comfort zone.<br /><br />The overall idea is a good one - self improvement by pushing your boundaries and finding your voice a little more. We all can use a little of that. But, there are a lot of activities on these cards that are a little over the top. Many cards require interacting with complete strangers in less-than-comfortable way and that's not an easy thing to do. In my area, strangers are frequently downright rude and hostile and that makes completing these challenges a lot more difficult. Many of the challenges are a lot more benign and less threatening, such as keeping a hold on your tongue and leaving nice notes for others. Some of them are more personal such as exercising and meditation. It's a mixed bag.<br /><br />This is an interesting activity deck that's designed to help users get more comfortable with themselves and to leave their comfort zones a bit. Some of the daily activities are easy, while others are exceptionally difficult to the point of being impractical. Your mileage may vary.",

    "text": "I have wanted one of these CMY cubes since I saw an online ad for these some months ago. They look cool and I thought they would make a neat subject for photography. I got the 95mm version and so far I am very pleased with it. It's not absolutely perfect but it is more than adequate for my needs. However, mine has a big, big problem with it.<br /><br />The idea of this cube is very simple. It is coated on each side with a color-reductive layer that allows certain frequencies of light to pass while hindering others. The cube is transparent so you can see through it, but the color coatings cause the appearance to vary depending on how the cube is positioned relative to the light source. While the colors are cyan, magenta and yellow (hence the name CMY), it is possible to get green, violet, red and other colors through the cube just by turning it. My camera picks up these colors and I get some great shots because of it. Shining a bright light through it casts a light smear on the surface where the cube is sitting.<br /><br />This is a solid cube that has some heft to it. It's a heavy thing, weighing in at almost 2.5 pounds, and it is a perfect cube. Looking through it, I can see very slight distortions from the manufacturing process, probably relating to temperature changes during pouring. It's not noticeable unless I look for it, and that was exactly what I did.<br /><br />As a conversation piece this thing gets passed around like a dollar bill.<br /><br />Less than 24 hours after receiving it, and after minimal handling, one of the corners started peeling. I was able to smooth it out to a point but I think it's a matter of time before it peels and is beyond fixing. For the cost I am very unhappy with this; it should be covered and sealed a lot better than that.<br /><br />This is a neat plaything and I really like it a lot, but it's flawed. It's great subject for abstract photography. However, the peeling color layers really take away from an otherwise really cool product.",

In fact, I still have it though I have not messed with it in several years. I was interested in these by Rubik and thought they would be comparable if not better than my older snake puzzle. They're good, though I was disappointed that they're smaller than I expected and in use they're not as quiet as I'd like.<br /><br />This is a smaller snake puzzle, as I mentioned above. When twisted into a ball shape it's about the size of a tangerine which is smaller than I realized. My older one was much bigger and it would roll into something about the size of a baseball. The size really is the primary disappointment I have with it.<br /><br />When first working with these, it is important to realize that they're tight and are difficult to manipulate until they have been worked with a little to loosen them up. After messing with one of these for a few minutes it became a lot easier to twist and shape and it felt a lot less like I was going to break it.<br /><br />These make an audible click when the pieces are turned. This might make these less appropriate for messing with in an office.<br /><br />There are two of these in the pack and they connect together to form a longer snake that opens up possibilities for new shapes that aren't possible with just one. The connection is via what I can best describe as a ball joint type of socket, and when connected they are difficult to separate so there's no worry that they'll fall and get separated. While this is a nice feature, so far I prefer messing with these individually instead of connecting them into one long puzzle.<br /><br />This is a nice puzzle snake package that gives two in one package that can be joined to make one longer snake. They're smaller than I expected, and they're not particularly quiet when the pieces are being turned, but these are well made and a lot of fun.",

I have never seen a leather board set before so this one is a new one to me. This is a nice set for travel and I like it, though I think it could be improved just a bit.<br /><br />The most obvious feature of this set is the board. It is a wooden box board that folds for travel and is of average size for a decent travel set. However, what sets this one apart is the leather outer shell which adds a measure of class to this board. It is a light, creamy color with darker black squares. The leather is smooth and velvety with attractive stitching around the edges. It appears to be attached to the box quite well though time will determine if this is actually the case.<br /><br />The board has ferrous metal under the leather so magnetic pieces can stick, even when the board is folded. This is perfect for travel, whether on a plane or in the car.<br /><br />The pieces are nothing special and represent the one area where I think this set needs some improvement. The pieces are a plastic/resin material that really lack detail, and though they are recognizable they just aren't particularly interesting. I would rather spend a little more and get nice-looking pieces that do the board justice. Dull pieces on a board like this are akin to having a candlelight dinner on paper plates.<br /><br />This is a nice travel set and the board stands out as something really special with the leather shell.

    "title": "Easy to Understand, but Complex Under the Surface",
    "text": "Family game night is important in our house, and I am always looking for games that the whole family will enjoy and will keep us laughing (or at least keep us entertained). I selected this one thinking it would be simple to learn and fun to play, and I was right. It has been well-received.<br /><br />The idea behind this game is very simple. Given five bad scenarios, how would you rank them, from bad to worst? And, just as important, do the others players in the game agree with you (or at least know you well enough to figure out how you'd rank these)? Points are awarded based on how well your fellow players can figure out your ranking. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.<br /><br />On the surface, this sounds very simple and straightforward, but it's a little more complex than it first seems. Yes, the rules are easy to understand and gameplay is as simple as described, but what is not so simple is how the players interact and how well they know one another. Often the game breaks into side discussions about why something is more terrible than another possible scenario, and often this leads to a lot of laughter but also some learning about the others around the table.<br /><br />Replayability is good for the most part, though I think an expansion pack in the future would be a nice addition to the game. I suspect this isn't likely though.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun game and will entertain most groups. A big part of gameplay is the discussions that erupt and the humor that plays into some of the scenarios. Looking for a different game that will get the group laughing and enjoying themselves (over admittedly dark scenarios)? This game is very much worth a try.",

    "text": "When I was a kid I used to love Hot Wheels cars and I had a nice collection of them. These little cars have been around for a long time and they have changed some but they're still a lot of fun, even for adults. I selected this set not so much for playing but for photography and so far I am pleased with them.<br /><br />These are a set of three themed packs of 5 cars each. The cars are reasonably well made (though there is a lot more plastic than when I used to collect these as a kid) and they seem to be painted cleanly as well. They roll straight right ouf the package too. For someone interested in little cars like these, this is a nice set to get started or to rapidly expand a collection.<br /><br />The one car in the set that I do not light is the skateboarder. I would rather have had another little truck or a rally car or something. Even a beat-up old truck with primer would have been more fun for me, but I digress.<br /><br />Price-wise these are quire reasonable. As I write this, the set is about $32, and that translates to just over $2/car. When comparing individual cars priced against this collection it's clear this is a decent value.<br /><br />I like these and they serve my purpose quite well. These seem to be made well and they're priced right. If you want to start a collection or want to expand one quickly, this is a good collection.",

It's a fast-paced game that requires luck as much as strategy, and that works well for all of us. We have a couple of Uno variants that we like, and with two adult sons that grew up with Mario games this is a good fit for our family.<br /><br />This game plays identically to regular Uno in almost every way. It has all of the expected elements of the game - 4 colors, skip, reverse, wild cards and more. However, it also has a special card that changes the game in a fun and often unexpected way, allowing a player to dodge attack cards and send them back to the one who played them. It's powerful enough to change gameplay but not enough to ruin the game.<br /><br />The cards are decorated with the familiar characters of Mario Brothers games - Bowser, Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong Jr. and more. Fans of the Mario Brothers franchise will like this deck.<br /><br />The game is packed nicely in a metal tin that protects the cards and keeps them together.<br /><br />I am not the least bit unhappy with this game and my family and I have been enjoying it. We look forward to game nights and this game will be a part of those nights.",

    "text": "I have loved chess for decades and in my teen years I did play in a couple of tournaments. The clocks used when I played were analog and were a lot simpler. I have wanted a chess clock for years even though I have not played in a tournament since high school, and I was pleased to work with this one. So far I am happy with it even though I am still learning how to set it up and work with it.<br /><br />This is a large-display digital countdown clock that allows for setting up various time controls. The instructions are a little on the sparse side but are clear enough to figure out how to set up the desired time controls, including adding time per move. When one player runs out of time, both timers stop.<br /><br />I like the rocker button used to control the timers. It has a soft touch and it works very much as expected. The older timers I used were single opposing buttons that would pop the other up when one was pushed. The rocker is a little smoother and is actually very quiet which can be good or bad - if you rely on the sound of the button as an audio clue that the timer has been touched then this clock probably will not give that expected feedback. Then again, if you need absolute quiet then this clock will help.<br /><br />It's not a perfect clock but it works well and I'm happy with it. It seems to be well made, the controls are easy to operate, and the price is reasonable.",

This game seemed like a good fit for my family based on our interests, and so far it has been a good addition to family game night. That said, this game tends to be on the easy side and the replayability isn't great if you want a varying experience.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is a basic move-around-the-board game at its heart, though it requires cooperation instead of competition and it relies on a story book to further the game along. Some real time and attention to detail went into the design and it shows.<br /><br />Though the game does not require following a path without turning to the left or right, it does follow a basic flow and the story book is designed to help guide and direct. That said, it essentially is a map of how to get through each step and it does not vary from game to game so once the game has been played the book could potentially slow down a game instead of moving it along at an interesting pace since previous players will know what to do.<br /><br />This is certainly not a bad game. It's a good family game and is worth running through as a group. However, for those looking for replayability, this one lacks variety.",

For the price this is a decent little console and I like it, though there is some room for improvement.<br /><br />In the past, playing the older games required downloading a ROM and putting it into an emulator, and if you knew where to look for ROMs you could find hundreds of them, many familiar and even more that were very unfamiliar. I expected this little console to be something silimar to the old emulator, preloaded with old ROMs, and it seems to be fairly close to that. There are many games I recognize that are a lot fo fun to revisit, and there are a lot of games that are unfamiliar.<br /><br />This console comes preloaded with several hundred games of varying types and quality. As mentioned there are quite a few that are familiar, but many that I never saw in an arcade. Some appear to be Asian releases that never were released here.<br /><br />Navigation is a minor pain. If you want to play a game that is far down the list, you have to navigate there every time. There doesn't appear to be any memory for last games played.<br /><br />Another minor disappointment is that several titles are listed more than once in the menu. This suggests to me that there are different versions, even if I can't tell what the differences are.<br /><br />I'm thinking this is the same thing as the old emulators that can be found online and it just packaged in a handheld and preloaded with ROMs. That's fine by me, I like those old games. It would have been nice to provide better navigation, though, and maybe reduce the versions of each game to the latest or most bug-free? For the cost, it's a worthwhile system if you love those old games.",

My observation has been “not so much”. It's there, but it's not strong at all.<br /><br />These are nice little pens that are probably best suited for kids and for people with small hands.

It has proven to be a decent game though it was a little confusing at first.<br /><br />The idea is simple. There has been a murder and the goal is to find the culprit. The whole group (all players) either wins or loses together, there is no individual winning or losing. So, it requires cooperation and careful strategy to win. It's a fast-paced game and a complete game can be played in just a few minutes after you get the hang of it.<br /><br />The deck consists of 24 cards, each representing a different character in the game. There's the murderer, which of course is the target of the game. There's a gossip card which is highly useful when used properly, a witness card, informant card, and many more. The cards in combination with one another can determine the end of the game immediately, or they can cause player actions which move the game along.<br /><br />The gameplay is pretty confusing when starting out. Certain events occur that require immediate actions, while others can trigger and end of game (winning or losing). Each card behaves differently. Fortunately, the actions are printed right on the card so it is easy to learn. Once a couple of rounds have been played it starts to get a lit faster and easier.<br /><br />This is a different kind of game that is a lot of fun. There's a brief time of confusion while figuring out how to play but once through that it is a very replayable game that really is a fun addition to family game night.",

It's a decent set up it lacks some fit and finish that would make it better.<br /><br />Included in the set is the Mancala board and a plastic bag with multiple colored stones. There is also a concise rulebook on how to play one variant of the game - overall, a decent starter set.<br /><br />There are several things about this set that make it less than ideal. The most serious problem is the board which has multiple issues. First, it feels unfinished with several very rough spots that are actually visibly rough. This doesn't make the game unplayable but it does take away. My board is not routed properly and it looks like the design was routed by hand and wasn't cleaned up properly with wood shavings wedged in the grooves. The reservoirs are shallow and it is easy to spill the stones while playing.<br /><br />The stones are another matter. There are enough stones to play. However, there are no extras at all and if one or more are lost the game cannot be played correctly without replacements. And, there's no container beyond a cheap plastic zipper bag for the stones; a cup with a snap-on lid, or a cloth pouch, would be so much better.<br /><br />This is a playable and functional set, lacking in finishing touches that differentiate it from a good one.",

The problem with most games is that they often favor the most cunning strategist or the most knowledgeable trivia buff, so a game like this has enough luck mixed in to make the game much more unpredictable.<br /><br />The idea of this game is relatively simple - end the game with the highest point value. This does not mean you have to have the highest value card in the whole deck, but rather the highest valued card among players. This means that a middle of the pack value can be a winner or a loser.<br /><br />The rules are simple. Collect your salary. Draw a ticket. Play a ticket or swap performers. Go until there are no more tickets, either in your hand or in the draw deck.<br /><br />There is some strategy involved, but luck of the draw is just as central to the game. If you have the ability to keep track of cards you can follow cards that you know about through swaps and discards. This can get tedious with more players though, so it isn't necessarily easy.<br /><br />This is a fun game that does not require a lot of brain power to be successful. Game play is relatively quick and the rules are very simple and easy to follow.

However, there are some other nuances to play - players can bet on how many others get the questions right as well, and there are power-up cards like Skip (pick a new question) to better your chances of winning - not unlike the original app. There are quite a few trivia cards of two types - multiple choice or single answer.<br /><br />There are two basic issues with this game, neither of which are deal breakers but both of which should be mentioned. First, the board is relatively short so the game usually tends to go quickly which may or may not be a problem. If you like fast games that can be over and done (or have limited time to play) this is fine, but if you're looking for a trivia game that can go for a while like Trivial Pursuit, this isn't it.

    "text": "Chess has been my favorite board game since I was a child and I have collected chess sets as a hobby over the years. When I selected this one I expected it to be on par with typical portable wooden sets which are usually cheaply made. This one was a pleasant surprise in that it is a step up from most portable wooden sets I have seen and used.<br /><br />This is a fairly straightforward set. The case is a clamshell design that folds open into the board. There are magnets in the rim of the underside of the board to hold it closed when the set is not in use, ands the manufacturer did a decent job of concealing the contacts (though they are visible if you look for them). The squares on the board are smooth and while the seams between the squares can be felt when you run your hand along the board, the seams are smooth and are less pronounced that what I have seen on some other boards.<br /><br />The pieces are decently made though are nothing special. They are machine cut pieces and have been smoothed, sanded and varnished. They are weighted nicely and have felt on the bottom to avoid scratching the board. They're a fairly average design but they look good and are very recognizable.<br /><br />The main feature of this set is that it is larger than most fold-out boards I have seen and used. While this might not be the best for packing and portability, I really like the size. I am less likely to knock over pieces accidentally and I can see what's going on a little better.<br /><br />This is not just a chess set but includes wood chips for playing checkers as well. The chips are small and are nothing of note but they are sufficient.<br /><br />I really like this chess set and will use it as my main travel set moving forward. I like the size of the board, the feel of the pieces and the overall quality. There are better sets out there but they cost more. There are less expensive sets too, and the chances of finding one that is of the same quality as this one for less is small.",

They're not terrible by any means, but if you are expecting large puzzles that fill up a table top, these aren't it.<br /><br />The pictures and landscapes are quite pretty and are very relaxing. The colors are a little unnatural in a couple of them, but the scenes themselves are very settling.

Four of the puzzles have 300 pieces while three have 500.<br /><br />These come in a set of seven and are bundled together well in a nice box that is suitable for gifting.<br /><br />This is a nice set up puzzles, a little on the pricey side but with pleasant landscape images that are quite pleasing to the eye. The puzzles seem to be about the right difficulty level and don't require a large time investment. If you have a puzzle lover in the house, this is a nice set to consider.",

    "text": "I have a few “collectible” decks of playing cards, this one among them. These are fancy cards that are made well and I like them, but the color scheme is a bit off for the black suit cards due to the background.<br /><br />I'll start with my main complaint with these first. These are dark cards, using a dark gray background for all suits, and using a dark purple for spades and clubs. This creates a low-contrast scheme that is more difficult to see in low light, and is less than pleasant even in brighter light. This is an unfortunate choice that could have been handled better. A bright purple, or even a strange color choice like orange or blue, would have worked better.<br /><br />The artwork on these is impressive. A good bit of detail went into each design and it shows. The number cards (2 -10) have small designs on them that are at times hard to see and look at without a magnifying glass, though.<br /><br />This are well made cards, coated and designed so they will not stick together even in damp climates. They come in a beautiful tuck box with reflective highlights in purple.<br /><br />These are not bad cards at all. They're beautiful and they're well made, and they have some incredible artwork. However, the color scheme is not the best and these cards would be even better if the background and black suit colors were chosen a little more thoughtfully.",

    "title": "Fun Game; Minor Issues with Rule Clarity",
    "text": "I selected this card game for our family game nights, as we're always looking for fun ways to spend time together and this one looked like fun. It's a really fun game with good replayability. There are a couple of places, though, where the rules are not well organized and could use some clarity.<br /><br />The idea of this game is simple - build a flock of hens that lay more eggs than that of your opponents. Avoid predators and diseases if you can, and on occasion take action against your opponents to either slow them down or make life difficult.<br /><br />In actual play, the game is not quite so simple. There are actions you can take every turn, plus you can play hen cards every turn to expand your flock, and your hens each lay eggs. So, a single turn can result in multiple cards getting played, and in some cases additional cards get played when the player finishes his/her turn and draws more. In one game, one of our players drew three “instant action” cards that required immediate play which extended the turn even more.<br /><br />Gameplay continues until all the cards are drawn and one player goes out.<br /><br />We found a shortcoming in the way the rules are written, particularly when it comes to action cards played against opponents. One card in particular limits the size of the flock you can have to three hens. In the rules, there is nothing in the description of this card that states that there's any way to remove that limitation; the remedy is described for a different card, and it is in a paragraph that almost reads like an afterthought. So, in the first game we played, this card was a game breaker because the player saddled with it didn't know there was any way to get out from under it. We found the solution after the game was almost over and it was already too late for the player to recover.<br /><br />Another question arose with this particular card that wasn't addressed in the rules at all. If the flock was limited to three hens, if it is played against a player who already has more, what happens? Does the player have to surrender hen cards, or do they simply stop laying? This of course is a minor sticky point and we resolved it ourselves, but it can cause some discussion when the issue occurs the first time.<br /><br />Games last about an hour (give or take).<br /><br />We have had a lot of fun with this game. It's different than other card games we have played, there's plenty of humor involved, and the game is ultimately replayable while retaining the fun factor. There are a couple of areas where the rules could be more clearly written and fine-tuned, but overall this is a well-designed game that is a good addition to family game night.",

I would not call it perfect, but it is a good set that I think makes a great gift or a group exercise set in an office.<br /><br />There are 28 puzzles and gadgets in all, 4 wooden 3D puzzles and 24 twisted wire puzzles. The wire puzzles are all packed in bubble packs to keep them separate, and the wooden puzzles are shrink wrapped.<br /><br />The wire puzzles are all different, but they often follow the same solving techniques. Some are easy enough to figure out just at a glance while others are more difficult and require a good think or even a little trial and error to solve. These puzzles are small, and with my larger hands I have had some difficulty working with some of these. Most puzzles of this type I have seen have been larger, making them a lot easier to work with (though no easier to solve) but also more expensive. This is the trade-off.<br /><br />From the standpoint that these puzzles are inexpensive and provide a good bit of mental stimulation and an outlet for fidgeting, this is an impressive and well-priced set. The downside is that these are small and are more difficult to work with if you have larger hands.",

It has some elements of Apple to Apples (the game to which it seems to have most in common) as well as a handful of other games, and it has provided my family with a lot of laughter.<br /><br />The game is actually pretty simple to play. Every player has a handful of cards with captions in three different categories, and the “judge” for the round plays a picture card and rolls the die that chooses the category. Players each play the caption card that they believe is the funniest, and points are awarded based on the judge's opinion (highly subjective) as to what's funny and what isn't.<br /><br />Play requires a minimum of 4 players to really be effective, but in larger groups it gets even more fun.<br /><br />The picture cards are often of people doing really bizarre things, or of redneck ingenuity, or of really back-woods scenery types of places and objects. Often, just looking at the picture is enough to make the room out break out into laughter, and when paired with the captions (which sometimes fit and sometimes do not), it gets even funnier.<br /><br />Hopefully, there will be some kind of expansion pack down the road – more pictures, more caption cards, or both.<br /><br />This game has been a hit with my family. If you like Apples to Apples, and if you like redneck humor, this might just be the game for you.",

    "title": "Refinement on the Old Elimination Game",
    "text": "When I was in high school my senior class played an elimination game that was vaguely similar to this (and has been around for years and is still played across the country). Each person drew a name and that was the \"target\", and there were only loose rules on how to \"eliminate\" your target (most memorable weapon was a seltzer bottle), and graduation was the time limit. TAG is basically a formalization of that game, with fewer players and more specifics on elimination.<br /><br />My graduating class had over 500 people, and not all of them played the game. Still, with 50+ players and months to play, it was unwieldy then. TAG limits the game to 10 players max, and the time frame can span anywhere from an hour or two to several weeks. Though the rules are flexible enough to allow for playing for months, this gets a bit cumbersome when having a small player pool.<br /><br />Each player gets an ID card (\"credentials\") and a target name. Unlike the more informal version of the game, players are given specific instructions on how to eliminate their target. It might be luring the target to a location or lying in wait, getting the target to do something, or more. Nailing the target with the squirt gun or \"poisoning\" their food with salt might be fun but if it's not on the specific method card, it doesn't count. Once you've eliminated your target, your next target becomes whoever your original target was stalking. Gameplay continues until there's only one player left.<br /><br />I like the way this game refines the elimination process, and I like the smaller, more limited scope. This makes it a good game for family events, fun in the dorms at school or even a company morale booster.<br /><br />If you've ever played the old elimination game, this will be familiar territory. If you haven't it's a fun introduction. There's reasonably good replayability and there's enough flexibility to either play quickly or draw it out for days and weeks.",

    "text": "I am a software developer by trade and I have an interest in small processor architectures like the Arduino, Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone. This seemed like a good kit to experiment with and learn. It is a nice kit but it does come with some built-in frustration.<br /><br />This kit comes in a plastic box with all of the parts organized and packaged to make it easy to find everything and work through assembly. Some of the other reviewers have mentioned having a defective box that broke. Mine seems to be fine and has maintained its integrity. What really startled me was the sheer number of very small components. Be very careful to keep track of the parts as it is easy to spill them and lose some if working in a carpeted area.<br /><br />Another surprise to me was that this car is about twice as big as I expected. That in itself is a good thing as it means it is easier to work on. I have the hands of a gorilla and it is difficult to cram my fat fingers into tight spots like computer cases, so having more room than anticipated to work was a pleasant surprise. That said, I made good use of a pair of carbon-tipped tweezers while working to get in the tighter spots and maintain control of the screws and posts.<br /><br />Assembly took some time because of the number of parts, but this was complicated by the less-than-stellar instructions that accompany the kit. The print is small and the directions are not always clear, so I found myself redoing a few steps along the way because I misread or misunderstood the instructions. On the plus side, I did not need to break out the soldering iron or special tools beyond the aforementioned tweezers and a better screwdriver than the one in the kit.<br /><br />Once assembly was finished, I ended up with a nice little car! It works as described with the remote and it does seem to be \"aware\" when it approaches a structure. The remote isn't particularly good though it is sufficient.<br /><br />I have not yet started playing with reprogramming the Arduino. That will come in the next few months as I get more time.<br /><br />I would not say this is a suitable kit for younger children (even when the car is finished). However, it is a great starter kit for older children interested in robotics and programming and it's even better for those who are interested in working together with their parents.<br /><br />I like this kit though there is room for improvement. My main complaint is the documentation, which is a bit unclear and printed a little too small for comfort. The kit itself is an interesting start kit for those with an interest in robotics and small-architecture programming, and for parents and children looking for a project they can do together.",

The closest I have come to an indoor battle with snowballs was with Nerf balls, and while fun it isn't the same.

They look like they'd be lightweight and airy which would make them too hard to throw any distance, but these are surprisingly dense and have a little heft to them (though still less than a regular snowball). So, they can be thrown a reasonable distance.<br /><br />Some thought went into these. When they are squeezed they make that familiar scrunching sound you hear when packing wet snow, which is probably the most interesting aspect of these. They are very densely packed and they do not lose material even when played with a lot which is surprising. They're heavy enough to travel a fair distance but light enough that even if you get nailed in the face they won't hurt you.<br /><br />I really can't find too much wrong with these. They're somewhat realistic, they're fun, and they're inexpensive. They are a good option for having a snowball fight without making a wet mess.

We have Jenga, a fun game in its own right, and Kozo on the surface appears to be very similar in concept. It's a bit trickier, though it's great fun. The one reservation I have is the sheer number of small parts – easy to misplace or lose if care isn't taken with storage.<br /><br />The concept is very similar to Jenga: stack and arrange your pieces and build your tower up without knocking it over. In concept, this is about as simple as it gets. However… Unlike Jenga, there are different sized pieces of different types, and as a result the placement is a lot trickier. Also, there are more rules to gameplay regarding what to place and when, and you don't necessarily lose when the tower falls as there are multiple rounds to play (if you follow the rule set as specified). Overall, it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />My concern is that there are a number of small pieces and these can easily get lost or misplaced. If the tower falls, it doesn't take much for some of the smaller black cubes to skitter away and end up under furniture where they're more difficult to track down. This is unfortunately the nature of this game; making the pieces bigger would increase the cost.<br /><br />Overall, fun game!

Whoever is taking their turn when the time expires gets a chip. There are 25 chips, so there are (under typical play) 25 rounds, though there can be more if the players are fast. At the end, the lowest number of chips wins.<br /><br />Overall, it's fun and a complete game takes maybe 30-45 minutes.<br /><br />There are a couple of problems, neither of which are deal-breakers but are worth mentioning regardless. First, the dice are very lightweight, and as such it is very easy to knock them and make them turn without meaning to when playing. That is, when you grab one of the dice, bumping one of the others can make it turn which is disruptive to the game. Heavier dice would have helped with this. Second, there is a limited number of categories – 54 to be exact – and in 25 turns you get the same ones over and over again. Though the letter changes, the game feels very repetitive as a result.<br /><br />This is a fun game and it is a good edition to game night. There's some room for improvement, but most will find the limitations livable.",

    "text": "I have not one but two Minecraft nuts in the house and when the Enderdragon showed up on my list I snapped it up, knowing it would single-handedly boost my popularity in the house. It's a well-made toy and it definitely will please any Minecraft addict.<br /><br />This is not a small item. Rather, it is quite big and it will take up a good bit of table or shelf space when it's not being played with. With the wings unfolded and the tail straight out, this takes up about as much space as a trash can lid, so if this is going to be something just for show, plan your space accordingly.<br /><br />It's more than just a simple model or action figurine – it does stuff. There is a row of buttons along the spine that trigger different actions. One makes this thing roar and makes the eyes glow. Another makes the wings flap, and another causes it to shoot plastic disks from it's mouth. As a word of reassurance to those who remember the problems with toys that shot things in the 70's, the disks do not shoot out at an especially high speed and they're a little large to get caught in the throat so the choking hazard is miniscule. In addition, it has a handle that than be raised along the back that make this thing a lot easier to pick up and carry, and the button that controls the wings flapping just happens to be placed so that it can flap its wings while being carried.<br /><br />It seems to be well-made and unless it is abused and mistreated it should last a long time.<br /><br />So far, I can't find anything wrong with this toy. It is large, and it is a little on the expensive side, but it is well made and it is more than just a simple silent action figure. If you have a Mincecraft fan in the house, especially one that loves to collect merchandise related to the game, this should be on your short list of gift ideas.",

So far I have been happy with it and it keeps my mind occupied in the evenings. For the price, though, there is room for some improvement.<br /><br />The object is simple. There are 200 game cards and a bunch of two-toned magnetic rectangles. Fit the rectangles on the game cards without overlaps so the colors on the magnets match the grid. As you might expect, this is not as easy as it sounds and you'll likely spend a good bit of time reworking puzzles to get them right. That's ok, it's forcing you to engage and think (which is the whole idea).<br /><br />There are two problems with this product, neither a show-stopper but considering the cost these shouldn't be present. First, the cards are a bit flimsy and it is a matter of time before they either get torn, bent or show lots of wear. The second issue is that the magnets are slightly larger than will fit neatly on the puzzle card. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but it is enough to be mildly annoying.<br /><br />This isn't a bad product by any means. It's a creative puzzle game that will keep you busy for hours (depending on how many you do in any given block of time, of course). It's a little expensive though, when considering that there's room for improvement in a couple of areas.",

I'm actually a little hesitant to use them for playing as they're fancier than any other playing deck I have ever had. They have a nice feel to them too, different than a Bicycle deck but slightly superior.<br /><br />This is the type of deck of cards that a collector or a serious fan would get, and I would not hesitate to recommend for those people.

I was delighted to have the opportunity to review this squirrel hand puppet. It is adorable and surprisingly it actually fits my hand.<br /><br />It is made of very soft, plush material that feels like (but doesn't look like) rabbit fur. The tail is a little different, being longer fibers and feeling very lightly more coarse. Looking this little guy over, the stitching is straight and I found no loose threads or blemishes in the material.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I am able to get my hand in this puppet and fit it properly. I have huge hands, so I was a little pessimistic that I would even be able to get my hand in this puppet. There are finger holes for the upper legs so you can wiggle his “arms” as well as move is head. There is no mouth to move, which is ok but is something to be aware of if this is something you are looking for.<br /><br />It is not designed to look realistic but it is recognizable as a squirrel. It is very suitable for use in a classroom or children's puppet show.<br /><br />If you are looking for a squirrel hand puppet that is great for children, this is a very good choice. There are other puppets out there that are more realistic looking, but they're also quite a bit more expensive. If you are content with something that is recognizable, works well and is not going to break the bank, keep this little guy on the short list.",

    "text": "I have always enjoyed coloring though I will readily admit I am a poor artist when it comes to drawing and illustration. I am learning as I go, though, and I am getting better. When I was a child I had a cheap set of colored pencils but I did not know the difference between those and good pencils until much later. I have a set of Prang pencils that has been my go-to as they compare very favorably against more expensive brands like PrismaColor or Staedtler. These colored pencils are a brand with which I was not previously aware and they also compare well against the more expensive pencils.<br /><br />I have the set of 48 pencils. There are larger sets and there are also smaller sets. For my limited abilities this is a good number of pencils and I can usually find a color that's close enough to what I want. For the occasions when I cannot get the color just right, I can blend and get the shade right. More experienced artists may prefer a larger set, while absolute beginners are likely to be perfectly content with a small (beginner) set.<br /><br />Coverage with these pencils is smooth and somewhat creamy, though a little waxy. I have been able to get very sharp, fine line detail as well as wide, smooth coverage when shading. I appreciate that these have slightly hard cores so they do not break or crumble like cheaper brands (Crayola comes to mind), and on very smooth paper the coverage is very uniform.<br /><br />This is a nice set of colored pencils. They have good coverage, the cores are hard enough to resist fracture and are soft enough to give nice shading coverage. There are several different pencil counts available, so choose the one that suits you best – if you are a beginner and are experimenting, consider the 24 count. If you are a very experienced artist, the 72 count might be a better choice. For me, 48 seems about right. These are a lot cheaper than the big names, but they seem to be quality pencils and I am pleased with them.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no/minimal cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

    "text": "I like board games and I am always looking for a good addition for family game night. I was given the opportunity to try Fauna. It's a different kind of game that has some appeal to it but it is slow and a bit repetitive. This is not my cup of tea, unfortunately, but I cannot deny the educational aspects of the game.<br /><br />The game board is double-sided and uses imperial measures on one side and metric on the other. So, there are some preference choices that can be made right out of the box. The board is very colorful and attractive. So are the game pieces – colored wooden blocks that are used in gameplay. And, there are lots of playing cards, the meat of the game, that have various animal species and information about them. The physical design of the game is nice.<br /><br />Each player gets the opportunity to bet on animal weight and location, knowing only the name, and there is a point scale associated with the betting process and getting the answers correct. The winner is the first to reach a certain point value (which of course is adjustable for “house rules” if you like).<br /><br />Gameplay is slow. The betting process takes a little time but so does reading each card and finding the information sought. According to the rules that come in the box, the game can usually be finished in 10-15 card draws; that may be true with the right crowd, but this can vary based on who is playing and much they already know. The cards are educational though and for the players who do not know a lot about the different species, this game becomes a learning experience.<br /><br />Games of this type (all the information on cards and the players have to know the answers) suffer from the same shortcoming – replayability. There will come a point down the road when all of the cards have been memorized, all of the facts have been learned, and there is only the luck of the draw separating the winner from the rest of the group. It may take a while but it will come.<br /><br />This is not a bad game. It has some value to it educationally and some players may find it great fun. I personally don't care for it and the gameplay is a bit slower than I like. And, once you have burned through all the cards it becomes a game of recall, not a game of speculation. If you like games similar to Trivial Pursuit or if you really want to learn more about animal species, this one is worth a look. If you want something fast-paced or very replayable, you might want to consider other options.",

There are no rules, no win conditions, no time limits, nothing that would define this as a game in the traditional sense. That does not mean that this isn't a lot of fun. It arrived on the day my son graduated from high school so it immediately had a steady stream of people playing with it and having fun.<br /><br />The concept is very simple - whack the hammer as hard as you can and try to get it to give you a high strength rating. That's it, nothing more. When you whack it, it makes a sound like shattering glass, then it calculates the strength of the hit. The strength can range from 000 to 999. I worked very hard to get a very low reading and was able to get it as low as 42; a guest of ours maxed it out at 999.<br /><br />This hammer has an oversized foam rubber head and a hard plastic handle. It will break fragile things like glass, but it can be used almost with impunity on desks, tables and counter tops.<br /><br />I see two very good scenarios for this item. The first is to entertain drunk college kids that are looking for excuses to express bravado and drink more. (C'mon, you know you thought that too). The other is to engage bored/frustrated office and lab workers.<br /><br />This is an interesting toy that works all right in groups. Yes, it is silly and is a one-trick pony but it's fun.",

    "title": "Great Variation on Chess; Includes Both Edition 1 & 2 Cards",
    "text": "Chess is a great game that has been around for a long time. Most people have some basic familiarity with the game though it is more uncommon to find someone with a good grasp of the game and the strategies involved in playing effectively. There is opening study, tactics, positional understanding... All of these are good aspects of the game but ultimately the game can be very predictable and one can be forced to make certain moves at various points in the game. Knightmare Chess is the answer to the monotony.<br /><br />Knightmare Chess is simple in concept and easy to play. The basic rules of chess apply and a chess board is required to play (unless the two players are able to memorize the board). Each player gets a certain number of cards and these cards are used to tweak the rules of the game. Some cards are played at the beginning of a player's turn, some at the end, and some actually are the turn. For example, a card can be used to convert a pawn to a knight before reaching the 8th rank, or force the opponent to take back a move, or even steal pieces from the opponent and conscript them into one's own army. The goal is still the same - checkmate the king - but now the path that otherwise would have been clear may be a lot more difficult.<br /><br />There is a rule book that explains the basics of play but there is room for variations in the way cards are distributed and played. Some variations even call for two sets of cards, one for each player, while other variations consider point values and limits. Personally, I like setting up a draw pile and a discard pile and allowing cards to be drawn or discarded on each turn.<br /><br />There is a total of 158 cards in the deck comprising the original Knightmare and Knightmare 2 sets, merged into one super set. Each card is plastic coated like high-end poker cards. The artwork on these cards is just beautiful and the artist who created them all took some time to make each one a miniature artwork.<br /><br />I was introduced to Knightmare Chess a couple of years ago by a coworker who happened to have both sets of cards and I was hooked from the start. I was delighted to find this set with all the cards for a reasonable price and pounced on them before they go out of print again. If you have never played Knightmare Chess (either set) you don't know what you're missing. If you have played and wanted a complete set of your own, this set is a great option and is priced very well (about $23 as I write this).",

Each player is dealt a set of cards describing a scenario where one would make some kind of facial expression, and then takes a selfie shot of that expression. After looking at the selfie shot, everyone else then plays one of their own cards to describe the expression, from which the original player selects a winner he/she likes most. Each person takes a turn taking a selfie and selecting others' cards.<br /><br />The game can be played without a phone or camera but it's a lot easier with such a device which will help eliminate disagreements.<br /><br />It should be obvious that this is not a game for the self-conscious individual.<br /><br />Though I don't think this game is all that original, it is a fun game and works in a crowd.

While it's a good toy and a lot of fun, it had a bad tendency to jam up when firing.<br /><br />As is typical with almost every other Nerf toy I have ever seen, this is a sturdy and rugged toy that should hold up under heavy play. It is made of heavy plastic that is of higher grade than typical toys and it has some weight to it, so it should manage well under being dropped or being stuffed in a bag and transported.<br /><br />Aside from being an 18-shot magazine-loaded toy, it includes an accelerator that makes the projectiles fly farther. When activated via a separate trigger, the gun makes a sound reminiscent of Sci-Fi blaster weapons, which is a nice touch for playing. The projectiles fly far enough that I am a little concerned about shots at windows - while we have not lost any windows because of this toy I am a little wary of pointing it in the direction of a window regardless.<br /><br />Unlike Nerf's Rayven product, the two-trigger mechanism on the RapidStrike works well.<br /><br />There is really only one flaw with this toy, and it is significant. It jams. My kids discovered this issue almost immediately and complained about it, and sure enough it did not take long for it to jam up on me too. When in the middle of playing, it is discouraging to have to pop out the magazine, unjam the blaster and reassemble. I am not sure what causes the jamming, but it's fairly consistent and it's impossible to ignore.<br /><br />My kids and I really do like this toy and it has been moved all over the house. If it did not jam so easily it would be an easy 5-star product. Unfortunately, it's a flaw significant enough to require a mediocre rating. It's really unfortunate - when it works, it's a fabulous toy, but when it doesn't it's just a disappointment. Hopefully Nerf will find a way to resolve this in the near future.",

    "text": "I love word games and I particularly like Scrabble. I have seen Words with Friends online and though I have not played it online I suspected this game would be a lot like Scrabble. It definitely is. It's a good game and can be a great addition to family game night.<br /><br />Words with Friends is a crossword game where the goal is to create words and score points by strategically placing the words on the game board. The board has a number of bonus squares where extra points can be had - double word, triple word, double letter and triple letter. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. Each player gets 7 letter tiles (with point counts printed directly on the tiles) with which to make words. Play continues until all the tiles are used and all of the scoring opportunities are expended.<br /><br />Game play as described above is just like Scrabble, but there are some differences. The score assigned to individual letters varies is little bit. The bonus squares are laid out differently too. Using all 7 letters in one turn results in a 35-point bonus, not 50.<br /><br />The tiles are a glassy-looking orange color and are very aesthetically pleasing, even though they are simply plastic. The board itself is a two-piece creation and it clips together into one larger board. Assembly is simple.<br /><br />I noticed a couple of flaws in this game, though these are not enough to lower my opinion of the game enough to matter. First, the board does clip together and turns nicely - on hard, flat surfaces. On carpet, the board can be a little uncooperative and can come apart. My second complaint is that the rules are so general that there is a little room for interpretation. People who have played Scrabble have a slight advantage - the unspecified rules are easy to fill in.<br /><br />I especially like something printed on the box: \"Your Smart Phone Unlocks Digital Features (phone not included)\" Sorry, this made me laugh - I hope it's clear to everyone that there's no phone in the box...<br /><br />Other than a touchy board and some slightly incomplete rules, this is a very fun game and is sure to be a hit on game night.

    "text": "I bought Dread Pirate at a store I found when I was on travel. I had never seen it before then and I did not know much about it but it looked like a fun game to try with the family. While it is indeed a fun game, it does tend to be somewhat repetitive and the novelty can wear off quickly.<br /><br />The game rules are simple. You get a ship and a bag of treasure and you have to collect more treasure by raiding ports and attacking other ships. Once you have sufficient treasure you can visit the central island where, if you're the first one there, you become the Dread Pirate with special attack and movement bonuses. The game ends when all of the treasures have been collected from the ports, and the player with the highest number of treasures wins the game.<br /><br />There are modifier cards that are pulled when a ship crosses certain areas of the map. These cards can add or take away combat bonuses and treasure. My observation with the cards is that there are really only a very few variants: +/- one or two combat, +/- one or two treasures, +/- moves, and gain a turn/lose a turn. Every card is different, though, in its description of how the bonus or penalty is assessed, and these variations on the cards serve as entertainment.<br /><br />Play is driven by dice. Roll the dice to move, roll one die to attack/defend. That's really all that drives gameplay. There is some strategy involved but it's limited in scope - a player can decide what route to take and what other players to hunt down but that's about it.<br /><br />The very best feature of the game is actual physical game pieces and map. This is a very well-made and beautiful game and it should last for a long time with proper care. The ships are metal as are the doubloons and the jewels are glass beads. The map is a very attractive cloth fold-out and the box in which the game came is solid wood. I have no complaints about the workmanship or materials.<br /><br />The game does tend to get very repetitive. Unless something particularly unusual happens during a game the play is fairly predictable, all players racing to ports and attacking each other repeatedly. To help offset this, we developed a couple of house rules to make the game a little more interesting though additional rules (or variations on the rules) would be welcome.<br /><br />We broke out this game on a game night when we had a house full of teenagers. With the exception of the kids living in this house, none had ever seen the game before. It was absolutely the hit of the evening and we heard from parents the next evening that most had asked for a copy of this game.<br /><br />Dread Pirate is most notable for the excellent game set. However, where it is weak is in the rule set and in the repetitiveness of gameplay. I have seen a movement online to generate expanded rulesets and hope that these new rulesets will add a fresh spin to the game. This is a decent game regardless and is worth a look.",

    "title": "Fun Nerf Gun, With One Flaw",
    "text": "I have two energetic boys that love to rough-house and play war games so a Nerf gun is a perfect toy to keep them busy for a while. This Nerf gun is great fun for kids and adults but there is one problem with it that keeps it from being truly great.<br /><br />Putting it together is actually fairly straightforward. In fact, it is more difficult to take it out of the packaging than it is to assemble. Once it is out of the box, loading the ammo and slapping in the magazine takes no time at all. There is that matter of batteries; this toy takes 7(!) AA batteries, 4 for the gun itself and 3 for the magazine. It seems a little excessive but it does not weigh down the toy as much as you'd think.<br /><br />The magazine needs batteries to power the blue light within that gives the gun a glow for night-time play. It didn't seem to add too much to game play but it didn't hurt either.<br /><br />There are two triggers on this gun, one of which handles the accelerator motor and the other that launches the foam projectiles. When the accelerator motor is engaged, the gun makes a noise reminiscent of a sci-fi blaster-type weapon that is being armed - really cool.<br /><br />This two-trigger approach is actually where we have found the one issue with this toy. Both have to be pulled for anything to happen and the placement is a bit awkward. Having larger hands, I have no trouble with it. People with smaller hands, however, are likely to have some difficulty with this setup. It is workable as a two-handed weapon but that (obviously) ties up both hands even though the gun itself is light enough to be easily carried with one hand.<br /><br />This is a fun Nerf gun for kids (or perhaps for cube-farm after-hours fun in the office) and it is well made. It works well and it does have a pleasing sound to it when it is used. The trigger configuration is the only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. If two triggers is not an issue for you, then this is a great toy that's worth the asking price.",

    "text": "I am a fan of Nerf stuff and so are my children. I really was excited by the opportunity to play with this Nerf gun.<br /><br />It arrived in an immense box which was the first surprise. I misjudged the size of this toy, thinking it was a bit smaller, so pulling it out of the box and the packaging was a bit of a surprise.<br /><br />Within a few minutes I had the gun out of the box and all of the clips loaded. I popped one clip in, turned the gun to the door, pulled the trigger and then realized that it needs batteries... I should have read the instructions, which clearly explained that it required batteries. The problem - it needs 6 D-cell betteries, which adds a lot of weight.<br /><br />Once I had everything set and batteries in place, I pulled the trigger and emptied one clip in less than 10 seconds. The gun has a firing rate of roughly 2 rounds per second. I was pleasantly surprised when the noise was not overly loud, in spite of a battery-driven mechanism for firing. I popped the empty magazine, inserted the next one and kept rolling.<br /><br />The gun comes with a stand, so that play can include simulating sniper fire from a nest, and there is a mountable shield on the front. Both of these pose some slight issues. The stand tends to fall if any pressure is applied to the gun while the stand is clipped on, which is better than breaking but it's still mildly frustrating. The shield also does not stay in place, and it interferes with the sight on top of the barrel. While it's not likely kids will need the sight, it's still a minor consideration.<br /><br />This is a rugged toy! The main gun assembly is built to hold up to rough play and it can handle some knocks and drops.<br /><br />It comes with 60 foam bullets/darts, exactly enough to fill all 4 clips. That's a generous number of shots, and I believe there are replacement available when needed.<br /><br />This Nerf gun is a lot of fun and will keep the kids busy for quite a while. The weight with batteries is a consideration and will affect play on occasion, but with the ability to set up the gun with the stand this becomes a less important factor.<br /><br />I did not immediately tell my children that I had this Nerf gun. They found out about 0.5 seconds too late...",

    "text": "We gave this game to my son as a birthday present, thinking it would be a good rainy-day activity for when he cannot get outside to shoot hoops. We had never seen it before and were hopeful that it would live up to the description on the packaging, and it has exceeded all of our expectations (not just his).<br /><br />The premise of this dice game is simple - you roll several specialized dice and based on the outcome determine if you score, get fouled, get the ball stolen or some other outcome. There's a printed rulesheet that explains what to do for practically all outcomes of a roll, leaving little ambiguity during play. Each player gets a total of 24 possessions, 6 per quarter, and there is a stack of scoresheets for keeping track of the game.<br /><br />For a dice game there is a surprisingly comprehensive coverage of the real rules of basketball. There's even a possibility of getting a slam dunk!<br /><br />A complete game can be played in about 15-20 mintes, even when referring to the rules frequently.<br /><br />The game is very well made. The dice are all made of hard plastic that are large and easy to read, and the throw cup is equally sturdy. The pouch in which the cup and dice fit for travel is a little on the cheaper side, being made of imitation vinyl, but this is not a serious concern if the game is cared for properly.<br /><br />The rules sheet is on the small side, so to account for the possible loss of the rule sheet I made a scan of it and printed it out as an 8.5\"x11\" page.<br /><br />All of us have had fun playing this game! For the basketball nut, this is a fun and well-made game that is not overly expensive and can be played in a reasonable amount of time.",

    "title": "Fair tactical problems, decent organization, bad interface",
    "text": "I selected this product over its competitor, CT-Art, due to the number of tactical problems and price differential. I have used ChessBase programs in the past and have had good experiences with them, so I thought this would also be a good package. In some respects I was right, but in others, not so much.<br /><br />Intensive Course Tactics (ICT) boasts over 4,000 tactical problems to work through and practice, which is very respectable. The sheer number of problems is enough to merit attention, but what is not clear is that a lot of these problems are very basic and suitable for beginners. Many, many problems in this collection are simple one- or two-move tactical finds, which are important even for more experienced players to know but they do not \"feed\" advanced players the kind of practice necessary to advance very far. Without question, less experienced players will glean the most knowledge from this collection. That's fine, but it should be made more clear in the packaging.<br /><br />ICT is broken up into a multitude of databases which at first seems a little overwhelming, but the organization is actually reasonably good. There are databases for tactics relating to forks, windmills, pins, skewers, material capture and a whole lot more. There is naturally some overlap in theme but overall the organizational layout is logical.<br /><br />The interface that is included with the ICT databases is not good. It is an old ChessBase reader and it is clunky, unattractive and a little awkward to use. The databases themselves are in ChessBass format though, so if you have a more recent version of Fritz/Hiarcs/Junior/etc., I would strongly encourage using that instead of the included reader to access the databases.<br /><br />ICT is really not a bad product. It has a lot of good tactical training broken into very logical areas of practice, but mostly for players working their way up from the lower end of the class rankings. It is unfortunate that the reader with it is poor. While I can recommend this product for certain players, I would encourage stronger players to look at more challenging options.",

    "title": "Fun game, though the rules are somewhat ambiguous",
    "text": "I picked up this game recently when I was on travel and I found a copy in a gift shop. I picked it up because of the name and I thought it would make an excellent conversation piece. It has proven to be more than that for my family.<br /><br />Morgan's Revenge is a form of gambling game, similar to craps though using a spinning top instead of a die. It's a game for groups, where everyone antes up and then each player takes turns spinning the top. How the top lands determines what action to take - put more in the pot, take some out, take all, etc. It's a lot of fun and even includes some \"silver\" pieces of eight and \"gold\" doubloons.<br /><br />There are a couple of problems, though. First, the rules are not very clear. Apparently this is intentional, as the rules explain that you can make rules up as you go. Well, ok, but a good starting point would be to mention how much of an ante to start with... More of a problem though is the limited number of coins in the box. You get 6 pieces of eight and 6 doubloons, so even though the rules state that any number can play, there's not enough coinage to go around unless you add some. That's all right, though, since you can play with pennies, marbles, rocks - whatever. If you can find more tokens/coins, you're in fine shape to play. I disagree with the notion that any number can play, though, from a practial standpoint - if you have 10-12 people at the table, it's going to be a long, long game with some frustrated players. We play it with 4 and it seems to be about right, though I could see up to 6 without too many headaches.<br /><br />The game is exceptionally durable. It comes in a metal tin, with a wodden block holder for all of the metal game pieces.<br /><br />As for its educational value, there are some piratey things you can learn from the tin and from the booklet, though once you have read those there isn't much else. It was not meant as an educational game, though.<br /><br />This is a fun game for groups, and it makes an interesting gift.",

She loves cutting up veggies & fruit & cooking them in her oven (my bookcase).<br />The velcro makes these easy for her to “cut” & then put back together. I thought I would need a storage bag, but she loves the wooden box & can easily get it off the shelf & carry it around. As always, Melissa & Doug make high quality items, right down to rounded edges & smooth chip-free paint. Dont hesitate folks. This set is a winner.",

Each piece is nicely painted. I like the color palette used for both the wooden pieces and play rug. The painted wooden pieces stand out against the rug.<br />The 4 piece train has rounded magnetic connectors which keep the cars attached when rolling over the curved tracks or just driving around on the rug or floor. The train tracks have nice grooves, which help little hands keep the train on the track. The puzzle ends of the train tracks are easy peasy for toddlers to attach. The RxR crossing track piece has moveable gates on each side. There is also a train track bridge that had a good size tunnel for the vehicles to go thru.<br /><br />The plastic wheels on all the vehicles are securely attached and roll freely.  There are 12 freestanding road signs that stand in square bottoms. The signs are the shapes and colors of actual road signs which is a nice learning feature. The words on the signs are large and easy to read.<br /><br />The vehicles are very easy to wipe off.  The rug is completely bound on all edges and had a non-slip rubber backing. All the images woven into the rug are crisp, large and easily identifiable. One of the best features of this set is the rug is machine washable.<br /><br />I love this entire set for my grand daughter and highly recommend it.  Hours of fun for kids and adults. Definitely stimulates the imagination.",

Small enough for young hands and large enough to make it easy to track and retrieve when flying outdoors. The bright red and white colors also make it easy to find.<br />Assembly is simple - place the rotary on top of the plane and click into place.<br />The instructions tell you to place the plane on top of the launcher hand grip and pull the string. Our first few tries, we were having a hard time trying to hold it straight so the top of the launcher grip was level, otherwise the plane kept falling off when we tried to pull the string, which was extremely frustrating, especially for a pre-schooler.  Eventually I figured out,  if you placed it on top of the launcher grip and gave it a gentle clockwise turn, the small metal bar under the plane would seat into the gear and remain in place until you pulled the string. Now it was fun to fly.<br />The action of the pull string is smooth and so far it has fully retracted to the original position after each flight.  I did notice, when I turned the launcher grip over, there is a hole in the bottom and I can see the rubber band. It looks like a narrow, generic rubber band so I am not expecting this to last very long before the rubber band breaks due to dirt getting into the hole or the elastic drying out and cracking.  Wont last as long as a spring loaded, twist-on, trigger release design.<br />As expected, the faster you pull the string, the higher it flies.  Fun to fly outside with pre-schoolers. They love chasing after it.<br />IMHO, this is pricey for the design/quality, but it is pretty fun for kids once you figure out how to seat the plane to prevent it from falling off the grip launcher. I wont be surprised when the rubber band breaks.",

    "title": "Book is extremely heavy",
    "text": "The Pop-a-Dots are a novel tactile experience for any little kid. The initial excitement is lots of fun. The color pallet is bright. The layout of the book is excellent:<br />1. The beginning of the book contains 14 pages showing 2 letters of the alphabet, per page, with a “Look for:” list of words at the bottom of the page. There are Pop-a-Dots for 1, 2 or 3 objects, per page.<br /><br />2. Next, there are 5 pages of upper case letters of the alphabet. Each letter has the head of an animal beginning with that letter and a Pop-a-Dot. There is a “Can you find” word list of the animals at the bottom of each page.<br /><br />3. The final page is an alphabet grid. Each block of the grid shows both the upper and lower case letter as well as an object. The full upper case alphabet and lower case alphabet run across the top and bottom of the page, respectively.<br /><br />I give 5 stars for the font, punctuation and correct relative sizing of upper and lower case used throughout the book. Excellent!<br /><br />There are some challenges for the intended age group, in my opinion, that I would like to share.<br /><br />Potential Challenges (imho):<br />1. When this arrived, the first thing that struck me is the weight of this book. It is too heavy for me to hold while reading alone or with a toddler. Book is recommended for ages 3-6 yrs. and those little ones could not hold this book. The only comfortable way to read it is opened flat on a table or the floor.<br /><br />2. The structure of the binding prevents the pages from laying flat when the book is open on a table.  The binding will be damaged/tear if a child presses down on the book trying to make the pages lay flat, specifically the pages in the middle of the book.  You can see in my pics the stress creases already showing at the inner binding edge of the first and last pages just from me flipping thru the pages for 15 minutes, or so.<br /><br />3. I am on the fence about the artwork (perhaps just a personal  aesthetic) and choice of some items used to represent the letters. For example, I had no idea what a Xolo was. I had to google it to find out it is a rare breed of hairless dog. I dont find the artwork for Quail, Iguana, Vulture, Ice or Gorilla to be easily recognizable to a child. Yoyo, Nail, Wig are not common objects for this age group. ( I checked the copyright date to ensure this was not an older book where a yoyo would be a known object. Copyright is 2019)<br /><br />All in all, the Pop-a-Dots are THE selling feature of this book. Kids love to pop them and the sound they make. If you are looking for a novel gift,  this would be a great choice. As far as a learning tool, this would not be among my top choices.<br /><br />I hope the pics below will clarify my thoughts on this book. Thanks!",

    "title": "Perfect size for toddlers",
    "text": "In writing this review, I am keeping in mind this toy is designed specifically for toddlers learning the concept of action/reaction. My 2 yr old grand daughter was my 'assistant' tester and we had lots of fun with this.<br />PROS:<br />1. Size is terrific for toddler hands. The car measures 5\" wide X 6.5\" long and 3.5\" from the floor to the top of the bubble dome. The remote control, not including the antenna, measures 3\" wide X 3.5\" long. The big round control button measures 3.25\" across. The antennas on both the car and remote are 6.5\" tall.<br />2.Antennas:  Both of the coil spring antennas are completely enclosed in clear, flexible tubing. No worries about little fingers getting pinched. The plastic \"receiver\" bobble at the top of each antenna is securely attached. I was unable to pull them off so no worries about small piece choking hazard. Also, I was unable to detach either antenna.<br />3. The bubble dome on top of the car is large and clear, giving a nice view of the circuit board, gears and lights from all angles. The plastic dome is securely attached and appears to be quite durable. It would take a good pounding with a wooden toy hammer to crack it.<br />4. Both the car and the remote are made from a very strong plastic and all edges are curved. No sharp edges at any point on either piece. The colors are rich and interesting: deep shades of red, cream, olive green, lime green and yellow.<br />5.Batteries: The care takes 4 AA batteries. It comes with batteries already installed in the car, but be aware the instruction state these are demo batteries only to display the flashing lights and should be replaced. The remote requires a 9 volt battery, not included.  My first thought was, why is this not rechargeable USB? But then, when seeing how long my 2 yr old 'assistant' will play with this I realized it would more than likely run out of the charge before she was ready to move on. So,  you may want to consider rechargeable batteries.<br />6. Installing batteries: Each of the battery covers are held in place with one tiny Phillips head screw. I was delighted to see the tiny screws have plastic disks on their tips which prevent them from falling out of the hole while unscrewing. GREAT IDEA!!! I always drop those little suckers.<br />The cover of the remote slides out of the end. It is a 'drop in' design battery compartment, nothing to attach. There is a little lip at the end - you know the battery is properly installed when the end of the battery engages with the lip. Please note the markings for the positive (+) and negative (-) poles are slightly raised and found on the inside, bottom of the battery compartment.  For me, they are very difficult to find and see - I had to get a flashlight to make them out. Minor issue.<br />7. The on/off switch is on the bottom of the car and is a good size. My 2 yr old 'assistant' can toggle the switch by herself, no problem.  Six red, blue and yellow lights inside the dome start to flash as soon as it's switched to \"on\".<br />The remote does not have an on/off switch.<br />8. Sound: I read another review commenting on the annoying sounds. The model we received does not have any sounds other than the gears turning. No music. No honking horn. No screeching tires. I was delighted with the 'no sound' feature and the lack of sound does not diminish my 2 yr old 'assistant's enjoyment with this toy.<br />9. Remote: The design of the remote is great for little hands. One Big Button. This is a 'floating' button design that can be pushed down at any point on the button - center or any point around the edge of the button. As an adult, I was trying to make the care go forward/back/left/right per the position I pressed on the button. Wrong! This remote will trigger two directions, only: forward and left. The button is a toggle. Push is once and it triggers forward. Push it again and it triggers left. Push it again and it triggers forward...... and so on. Push and hold the button and the car will spin.<br />10: Two yr old test drive: She was delighted when she switched it on and the lights started flashing. She likes to carry it by the antenna, so I am really appreciative it is encased in that clear, flexible tubing.  She had fun pushing the car around on the floor and watching the lights. When I gave her the remote, I simple said it had a button you can push. She loved it??? At first she was holding the button down and watching it spin and spin. After a while she unintentionally gave the button a simple short push and it turned left and stopped. She was surprised. From that point, sometimes it would move forward, somtimes left and of course there was the spinning. She has not yet associated the movement with how she is pressing the button, but she is having a great time. She laughs and squeals and loves to 'go get it' when it goes forward. I loved watching her and know she will have it figured out in no time.<br />What a great little sturdy toy to introduce toddlers to a controller.<br /><br />CONS:<br />I really dont have any true cons. I would make 2 suggestions:<br />1. Place the positive (+) and negative (-) makings for the 9 volt battery on the outside of the battery compartment or make them a contrasting color to the cream.<br />2. In the instruction pamphlet, add a little section altering parents the remote button is a forward/left toggle only and is not intended to have forward/back/left/right functionality. This will ensure the parent does not think it is broken.<br /><br />Overall, I give this toddler toy 5 stars. Well thought out design. Perfect size for toddlers. Easy to use. Durable and really cute. My 2 yr old grand daughter is having so much fun playing with this, I could not be happier.",

    "text": "Lovely set of toddler size puppets. She is learning her animal sounds and these puppets are wonderful for acting out “Old McDonald”. You fingers slide into the arms for waving and clapping. The mouths dont move but you can easily move the heads in time with the music while singing the song. They colors and details are aforable. They even have tails 🤗<br />This is a really nice set of puppets at an amazingly low price. Great buy!",

    "text": "14 mo old grand daughter has so much fun playing with this. First off, it is deceptively light weight and the handle makes it easy to carry. She loves opening and closing the barn doors and the 3 swing-open stall doors, putting the animals and farmer in and out. The two levels and various openings make this a lot of fun for her. We also play together - its so light weight I can hold it open on my lap with the doors facing her and play a peek-a-boo game with the figures, which she loves. We already have a bunch of FP Little People animals and they are the perfect size for this barn. This is the toy that holds her attention and imagination the longest at this age. When playtime is over, all the animals can be stored inside, close up the barn and put it away.<br />Exceptional quality and value. In my opinion, this beats FP, M&Doug and Vtech barns, hands down.",

The Stella baby doll was the only one I could find in a light brown skin tone and I am so glad I ordered it.<br /><br />This is a perfect 1st baby doll for an 11 month old - and it matches her skin tone, eye color, hair color and even has an aforable chubby baby belly. I love that the entire doll is soft (no plactic head). The attention to detail is wonderful: ears, belly button, 10 fingers, 10 toes. The soft magnetic pacifier is a clever accessory. I was tickled to discover she even has a little diaper under her bloomers. I am truly delighted with this purchase.<br /><br />If you are looking for a light brown skin tone doll with dark eyes and hair, this ‘peach' Baby Stella doll is wonderful.",

I'd like to find one that has a small watch face, bands that can be changed, uses a good app, and can monitor O2, sleep, and a wide variety of exercise. This watch was a perfect 10 in looking nice for my small wrists, and bands that can be changed. Unfortunately it fell quite short of the mark for everything else I needed.<br /><br />The app has me ready to put this watch back in the box and try something else. It's a really clunky app compared to others I've tried (Fitbit, Da Fit). The exercise feature is very limiting and doesn't account for any indoor exercise like a stationary bike, aerobics, treadmill, etc. Most of the time the steps on the app are wrong compared to the steps on the watch, even after trying to sync it again. It's disappointing that there's so few watch faces to choose from. I can't even choose the screen analog look watch face that is displayed on the box, it's not an option on the app at all. The O2 feature is nice, and so is the sleep feature. I do hope they'll continue to work on the app, it does have potential but doesn't work well for me as it is right now.<br /><br />I'm also having some trouble trying to use the long press on the watch itself to select features. It's just not working no matter how often I try. It's really disappointing that such a beautiful watch has so many problems. I would have really liked to use it as my main watch, but my search will have to continue on.",

There are much better craft knives available that aren't very expensive so I'd recommend using that instead with a self-healing mat. Same for the little scissors, use your own instead. Good tools make the assembly process so much more enjoyable.<br /><br />The kit assembly went well, no pieces were missing. It's a beautiful little kit and I look forward to trying other kits.

What I like is that it can all be stored away in a labeled plastic bin with a lid (I use a clear medium sized Rubbermaid bin), so nothing gets lost.<br /><br />The one detractor of this set in my eyes, is that it's a little overpriced.

Different strokes, you know?<br /><br />I love the color on this Twist n Turn Barbie. She's beautiful, and her outfit is gorgeous too. But the factory did a terrible job with the back of her hair. It's rather ragged and uneven. The hair on My Favorite 1967 Twist n Turn Barbie is much more even. Thankfully it was not too difficult to fix it and she's hanging out in my display cabinet with her titian repro pal in the Zokko! outfit. I really wish Mattel would also lay off the stuff they use to shellac the Barbies' hair. It doesn't look nice at all. They need to rethink the style of stand as well. It doesn't really work to hold up the doll, unless you unsnap her dress in the back. I'll probably pick up different stands.<br /><br />But otherwise I'm having so much fun gathering up some old favorites! I'll definitely be looking for the other Gold Box reproductions.",

Will change the five stars once I've ran some packs. Would recommend. Waiting on the front now<br /><br />Update 9/30 One broke at the threads snapped right of. Not over torqued loose cause I'd would bind the wheel hub but used thread lock. 75 % throttle on grass, seen wheel fly off. I have noticed that the other side is bent at the threads and causes a wobble real bad at high speed. Waiting on replacements from GPM. And will update at that time. So far my recommendation is 50-50 out of the Aarmas and the offbrands on Amazon and eBay these look like they could and should be the best option but again material and craftsmanship it's about a one 3/10. Will update again once I receive the replacement or repair items.",

They are likely pulled straight out of ETBs and resold considering booster boxes and individual packs of Celebrations were never sold like most sets.<br /><br />Yes you will pay a premium but it's only natural because of how these packs are attained out of ETBs but you are getting fresh packs that have not been cherry-picked, weighed or resealed.<br /><br />If they have I never would've gotten the most valuable card in the entire Celebrations set.<br /><br />Here is a photo for proof.",

    "text": "My kids, ages 3, 6 and 8, have now played with this for several days for 2-4 hours at a time. They have made a giant rocket, an igloo type structure, a pretend volleyball net, and more. And they have had issues with all of it. At first they had a lot of problems pushing the connectors on tightly so it didn't immediately fall over. They got better at that, but it still remained a problem because even when one or two weren't tight enough, the whole thing would fall over. They remained determined after the first few fails, and I helped put together a pretty large “igloo” we covered with two full size sheets. It was large enough the 3 of them could all fit inside, but after I left the room for 30 min, I came back to find the whole thing had crumbled and only a small portion remained standing. (And of course I have to mention the 8 million pieces this comes with - if you get annoyed with crap all over the place, this is not the toy for you.) So even though my kids thought it was fun, if they cannot use it themselves, and if it isn't stable enough to stay up even when I build it for them, I have to conclude it's not for us. I don't want to have to continually be there to make this set function as you would hope it would.",

    "text": "My 6 and 7 year old love this train, but ages 5 and up could easily enjoy it (even though the box says 7+). They had it put together in a a few hours and we all love the different things to do with this set. This train is definitely more interesting and interactive than the passenger train!! We really love the auto carrier with the car, and the gas pump too! Of course having more tracks would be more fun, so we will probably add more tracks soon. We also got the train station and that is a really fun addition as well. You could clearly spend $350 making a really awesome set up if you were so inclined, but even without any additions, this freight train is awesome and I'd recommend it over the passenger train since there is more to play with here!",

It was about a 3.5 hour build for her, which isn't super long considering the price, but the thing we really love about all the Friends sets are the attention to detail and accessories that make it ideal for lots of play after the set is built. The space school building is just alright, but she loved the rocket and the space simulator. This set also prompted lots of questions and encouraged us to research space exploration and learn more about science, which was great.",

Lego Friends in general is really designed for kids who want to play with the end build and always provides a ton of accessories (like brushes for the horses, trophies for after their competitions, water hoses, buckets and a spray bottle for grooming, etc). Our favorite part is the top of the trailer where the puppy can sleep. :)",

It looks really cool, but the stunts are really hard to do. The flywheel motorcycles are cool- you push the wheels hard against the floor once or twice to get it spinning, then you let it go (basically the opposite of pull back cars). But they are really hard to line up correctly and at the right speed to complete the loops. They are really easy to get them going too fast, and you have to let go of them quickly to keep the wheels inertia, so you can't spend much time lining it up well. And if you take your time to line it up and do it slowly, it doesn't have enough momentum. Also look at the picture of the monster truck… the motorcycle is supposed to go up the ramp and jump through the flames, but it has to be lined up so perfectly and the start of the ramp is hardly any bigger than the motorcycle.<br />So individually, the pieces of the set are all pretty cool, but it's really hard (even for the adults in my house) to use them together to do the stunts.",

    "text": "My 6 year old has been very in to Legos for the past 2 years and can do sets well above his age range unassisted. These looked like a fun alternative to engage similar skills, but they ended up being a disappointment. He was getting pretty annoyed with the general lack of stability and the wobbly nature of these. If you push areas too hard, it often affected other parts of the structure and caused them to bend or become unstable. He was able to build a couple of the creatures himself, but had no interest in playing with them anymore after they were built and did not attempt anything of his own design. We will stick with Legos, which he will play with for hours and hours.",

    "text": "My kids love creating with aquabeads so have tried many different sets. Our favorite is the beginner studio because it comes with a nice variety of beads, a storage container and tray, and a bead pen to help place beads (and had been around $16 the few times I purchased it). This is only a refill - no tray or storage container included, so you need to have those before purchasing this. As far as refills go, it's ok, but we have so many issues with the star beads every single time we use them, and we have mastered the art of spraying and flipping pretty well. The star beads often don't sit exactly right and if they don't make good contact when they're sprayed, they will fall off. And it's hard, if not impossible, to fix after they've been sprayed and flipped. So we prefer the Mega Bead set for the value, included case, and lack of star beads.",

This set gives a lot of colors and a lot of aquabeads, although I personally don't like the star beads AT ALL. They are constantly falling off/not expanding and sticking correctly to my kids' designs, and they make us all frustrated. I wish these were all standard spherical aquabeads. Also the container of pretty annoying. A cardboard box would've been better and more compact, instead of trying to shove the packs into the weird cube case that splits completely in half. I have purchased the Mega Bead set in the past and that is currently $16 for 2400 beads, comes with a nice tray and has no star beads. I'd definitely recommend that one over this.",

Also due to the rubbery/silicon feel of the doll and the outfits, and also because they are very tiny with tiny little limbs, they are very hard to change the outfits. My 5.5 year old could barely get the skirt changed and gave up on changing the top of the dress. It took me about 2 minutes to change one of the dolls. Also they don't all stand up by themselves. Most of the dolls with the long dresses can stand/rest on their dress, but we couldn't get Pocahontas, Moana, and Jasmine to stand up unassisted. If you have an older child (maybe 6-7?) who can change these on their own, or a little one who really loves princesses and is fine without changing them much, these are still cute dolls that will be fun to play with. I just personally wouldn't want to pay more than $35 or so for this set (and be stuck constantly changing them for my child!)",

LuLu is well built and a quality doll. She is interactive and you can take her temperature and feed her a bottle or a spoon for pretend medicine. She does not say any real words. She says “LuLu Achoo” and also makes baby noises. At one point my 2.5 year old said “Why [does she] say ‘ba ba ba‘?“ because LuLu primarily babbles baby nonsense noises. She is fun for small periods of time, but at the end of the day, she is a hard doll and not cuddly or cozy. I briefly searched for additional Baby Alive outfits to buy to increase her appeal/things to do with her, but I didn't find anything. So 9 times out of 10 my toddler is going to pick her simple, soft, changeable Corolle or Bitty baby. Which leads me to conclude, if this doll was only $20 and you could get a few hours of fun out of her here and there, I'd recommend trying her. But at $50, I would personally pass on this.",

While cute, they are limited in how many times you can rearrange them, and then they throw off the aesthetics when tossed in with all of our colored sets. My kids were only interested in the cat in the hat storyline for a short period, then I was just bothered with them not matching, haha. I definitely recommend buying kids magnatiles for the creative, open ended play they provide, I would just recommend buying the biggest solid set you can.

    "text": "My kids have enjoyed playing with this for 20-30 min at a time. It normally ends with them coloring the entire surface then losing interest while it takes 10 min to dry. For less saturated sections, like when they use the stamper or color lightly, it sometimes only takes 5 minutes for it to dry and be ready to color again. It comes with a great amount and variety of accessories like the stamps and stencils and 4 pens, all of which are added bonuses over some other similar mats I've seen on Amazon. I debated between 3 and 4 stars since my kids do like it, I just don't see a ton of long term use since it is already showing wear after a few uses. If you have any Melissa and Doug Water Wows, you can probably picture how it starts to wear out with normal use pretty quickly. So overall fun but maybe not the best cost to entertaining-kids-for-a-long-time value.",

I showed him how to roll it out in to long cylinders and piece them together, but he really just wanted to play with the foam without the cards. Also our set is missing a card, we didn't get the Y/Z card. Also, this is definitely lacking for long term storage. The foam comes in a flimsy plastic tray that I guess you are supposed to reuse, but it's not durable or nice. Overall we enjoy play foam, but much prefer the Pals that come in hard plastic domes.",

The other set, which I gave 2 stars, was so simple that my 4 year old had mastered the one skill of measuring in about 10 minutes. Both of the Osmo Math wizard games are pretty simple in the fact that they don't have a lot of variety and you kind of just do the same problems over and over. But whereas the repetitiveness of this game teaching addition is alright for reinforcing the skill, the repetitiveness of measuring dragons in the Secrets of Dragons gets boring quickly and is unnecessary.<br />I still prefer all of the creative Osmos over this (like Monster and Super Studio), but my kids do enjoy this.",

You basically open the beautiful game board/book it comes with, measure dragons with a ruler, then feed the dragons by lining up physical food tokens. That's it. My 4 year old can definitely do this. And I kept expecting my almost 6 year old to say she was bored and done before I turned it off. I guess if it was cheaper overall then maybe I wouldn't have been surprised by it, but for the price it doesn't seem like the value is there. I can teach my kids to measure and estimate lengths with tokens in about 10 minutes, I don't need a $60 game to help.... I definitely would not purchase this for a 7 or 8 year old.

My 5 year old likes using it a lot. But I paid $8.50 for it and it's definitely worth about $3. On the manufacturers website the list price is $3.99 if you want a few and it may be worth it to pay the shipping cost. I wanted to get my daughter a pen to go with the Frozen set since it didn't come with it, so I purchased this. But I also at the same time bought my son the Aquabeads Beginners Studio for $14.99, and that came with its own pen. I should have just bought 2 of the Beginner Studios.

    "text": "My daughter colors a lot, and we have been testing the various new Bic markers a lot! These are our least favorite.<br /> First, they really aren't that much bigger of an easy grip. The barrel is the same size as the Child's First ultra washable Bics and the Brush tip Bics, it's only slightly larger than the Ultra Washable Medium markers. Also the box for these is really flimsy and was already coming open at the bottom when we received them. Most importantly, the tip is not great for large areas of coloring (like classic Crayola markers) or for details. My 5 year old was really impressed with the Medium markers and loved the detailing she was able to do with the fine tip on those. She also loves the brush tip line. Those have been great for both drawings and for practicing writing and numbers.<br />If you are looking for good first markers, I'd stick with Crayola. If you want something for more detail, give the Medium or Brush Tip Bics a try.",

Since it's not too expensive it's not necessarily a bad value, it's just something to note.

Three of the nine options on the spinner are negative - either give a button to the player on your right, put one button back, or put ALL buttons back. This makes the game way too frustrating. I started playing this with my 4 and 5 year old and we quickly each had 2-3 of the 5 needed buttons, but for the next 15 minutes we kept spinning negative results enough to keep emptying our Pete boards and staying somewhere between 0-3 buttons. My 4 year was finally lucky enough to finish the game and I begrudgingly tried one more round to see if the first was a fluke. It went very similarly with my kids being frustrated that they often would get up to 2-3 buttons then have to put them all back, over and over for a long 15 minutes.<br />We also have The Sneaky Snacky Squirrel by this company. It's very similar in working fine motor skills and a great quality, and it is not frustrating at all!! Of the 10 spinner options for that game, only 2 are negative causing you to put acorns back. And my kids actually enjoy it. That one is SO MUCH BETTER!!! I would definitely avoid this Pete the Cat one!",

The dots were tricky for me to combine and roll out. They were also hard to cut out with the roller wheel because the layer of glitter dots would separate and tear easily. This was solved by kneading the dots thoroughly, but this made the colors run together (but not in a good way). However, the cookie cutter shapes were easier to cut out.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good concept and it certainly cut down on the cleanup usually associated with glitter projects, but in reality the dots are difficult to work with.

The only wood involved is the dowels on the station, making this add on primarily plastic. My son will still absolutely love getting this for Christmas, but I'm not sure if the value is here on this one. The siren on the police car does add a touch of fun, but I recommend checking yours on arrival if it's a gift, because I actually had to replace the batteries (2 LR44) before it worked. Also it was delivered without an Amazon box, and simply had an address label on the Brio box, so I'm glad I saw it on the porch before my son did. Overall fun but pricey for just being plastic.",

    "text": "This version of the classic marble run is just ok. The pieces are interesting, especially the light up one, and they are made of nice, sturdy plastic. But there are a few issues that make this toy frustrating for my kids to play with.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the pieces do not have consistent tolerances for the connecting portions. Sometimes they snap together easily while other times it takes a lot of force. My 2 and 4 year olds cannot do this without help. They always end up knocking the sections over when trying to put the pieces together. This hasn't been the issue when they played with another brands' marble run.<br /><br />Another issue is that there are not enough base pieces compared to the number of “action” pieces (like the ramps, slides, etc). This results in having to build tall, unstable designs that are easily knocked over, which makes the first problem even worse.<br /><br />Also, the piece that shoots the marbles up is difficult for my fairly coordinated 4 year old to use. It requires a quick tap that is firm but not too hard. It would be nice if it was easier to use. Both of my kids like the idea of this piece, but I end up having to do it for them. And I can't always get this piece to shoot the marble properly every time.<br /><br />Last, it would have been nice to have a couple of example layouts included in the instructions. This is not too big of a deal, but the pieces are difficult to connect and take apart, so for my kids' sake, knowing some layouts that use the different sections properly would be nice.",

To close the camper, you have the fold the back up and in to it, which my 3 year old can't always do. Also once it's closed, you can't really fit much/anything in to the back of the camper. So while my kids would love to drive around with all of the other Toy Story Little People they have from a separately purchased set, they cannot.

It's pretty bulky too, so it falls off her wrist a lot and she needs help putting it back on. I personally don't love the two phrases it repeats over and over “Paw Patrol is on a roll” and “Paw Patrol to the Lookout!” At first I thought my daughter was intentionally pushing a button each time it would say that, but she wasn't. Whenever the watch cover has the slightest pressure pushing it down, it hits the inside button and the phrases sound. Its pretty annoying to hear over and over. My daughter would be just as happy with a normal watch that just told the time and had a Paw Patrol picture on it.",

The other three smaller pieces are ok, but pretty small/limited in how you can play with them.
