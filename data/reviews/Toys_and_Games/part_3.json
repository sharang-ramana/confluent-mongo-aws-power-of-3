You put your card in it and record whatever money you received or paid during a turn. The device tallies all the money and tells you who won. If you prefer the original &quot;Life&quot; game but not the hassle of dealing with paper money on every turn just give every player a calculator and let them tally their individual money totals on their own devices. Then you don't have to pass around one device, you don't have any cards to keep track of, and you can play the original game but &quot;electronically.&quot;",

The flap on the end that allows you to connect with another tunnel is easily stowed out of the way by just pulling it back around the open end of the tunnel.  Nothing negative to say about it.

I purchased this product for my 3 year old niece so that she would have something to do at our big family Thanksgiving. She was excited as she looked forward to opening it (after 3 more bites of sweet potatoes). We unwrapped the box together as she sat on my lap. The first thing that I noticed was the multitude of colors -an almost overwhelming array- which immediately sparked creativity and imagination in both of us. She doesn't like to get messy. This is not at all the \"messy\" type of clay. It sticks to itself and nothing else (floor, tablecloth, hands and face). It even has a pleasant, almost cotton candy, aroma. I was so focused on the mindful, stress relieving activity of squishing and snapping the clay, I almost didn't notice the hilarity of what was happening all around the rest of the dining room table. Every member of my family, from age 3 to 66 was playing with the clay. There were enough individual packs to go around and we still have a few unopened colors to delve into next time we gather. The turkey was cooked perfectly, the butternut squash soup was delicious, and Lord knows I love that pumpkin pie; but, the real hit of the party was Sago Brothers Magic Clay.",

They are large enough that you can put perfect fit sleeves and then put the sleeved cards into these sleeves. They are adorable and good quality, although like most sleeves, if you play with them and shuffle a lot, the corners end up bent and split at the seams.<br /><br />These are holding up very well so far after several games and they are adorable. I highly recommend them to any Eevee fans, especially with all the Eeveelution GX cards that have come out!",

The ages are 2 1/2,  4, and  5 yrs old.<br /><br />This is a cute set, but it can get a little boring just watching this go  around in circles.<br />But this is what makes it different.<br />When Thomas gets off the boat, you have to be quick to get the boat back to the beginning of the water part, so<br /> Thomas can get on the boat again to bring it to the other side where the tracks are. Etc.<br /><br />When Thomas is on the plastic water he is rocking back and forth. The kids like that.<br />Would be better if there was a bridge or something more then just circling all the time, and more tracks..<br />All new toys kids are excited About, Not sure how long the kids are going to be playing with this toy!<br /><br />You can put thomas on a flat floor and it goes also.<br />I found it odd, that there was nothing on the box, or in the description that I could find,That you need 2 AAA batteries.<br /> So, be ready.",

This has everything. Sounds , lights , talks , feed the Unicorn its carrot.<br />Over 40 songs, sounds and phrases it says on here..Although I have not notice there are that many!!<br /><br />There are so many different toys out there, that just about do the samething, but this one is in a class all<br />its own..Just being the Unicorn makes it special, watching the wings flap,walk, talk etc.<br /><br />The only soft part on this , is it's tail and Maine, But this toy is not a cuddle toy, although very cute.<br />It walks better on the kitchen, and dinning room floor, then on the thick carpet,<br /><br />Includes a short life battery for just trying..It takes  2 AAA and 4 AA batteries<br /><br />I recommend this Vtach unicorn.

The eyes are huge, kind of scary looking, but the kids like it.<br /><br /> It only shows it is for little girls, All pinkish box , and the box only show's a girl playing with it.<br />I got this kiddy for a 7 yr old boy to have cause his Mother is going to have surgery. I thought it will give him something different to do instead<br />of him using his phone & ipad for games. Also thought he would like to sleep with this, but its Not cuddly.<br />But he seems to like this cat, as he has wanted a real kiddy for a long time.<br /><br />Love the idea of this cat, but for this price (50.00) why didn't did the Manufacture put a thick padding under the fur,to make this cuddly,  but leave little openings to let the sounds out etc.<br />Btw the sounds are loud.<br /><br />The cat measures 12 inch tall..Nice size.<br />If I could give this a 3 1/2 star If I could, so I'm giving this 4 stars cause the child does like it.",

You have to put the steering wheel on, the light bar, decals etc.<br /> The wheels came already on,which made it easy getting this big truck out of the box.<br />I laid the box on its side, opened that end, and wheeled it out, instead of having to lift this 50 lb truck out of<br />the box..<br /> Even my 7 yo grandson loves this and thinks its cool looking.<br /><br /> The problem I have with this is, we live on 9 ac, and for the kids to go around the big dirt driveway that is Not level, it does not work<br />very well, cause the tires are Plastic! So there is not much traction at times.<br />Although this goes pretty fast for young kids.<br />The kids are still getting the hang of steering this. If we do not watch them, they will go into a tree!<br /><br />That said, we follow the kids from behind, have to give this truck a shove to get it up slight incline  No problem when<br />there going down. Once they take there foot off the pedal the truck will stop.<br />Its cute with the gas pedal on the floor. The other electric bike we have has a button to press on the handle bar, so the 2 yo was using his toe instead of his thumb to make it go !!<br /><br />Now he has the real deal with this truck.Pedal on the floor.<br />There is some room in the back for the child to put a toy back there. Or if you do not put the light bars on etc.<br />there might be room for another child to sit there! Have not tried that yet, so do not know if the battery is strong enough!<br /><br />The battery last for a longer time then we expected without slowing this really down.<br />Its better to wait for the battery to become almost dead before recharging.It will last longer.<br /><br />Any child would love this.I think you get allot of truck for the money..<br />This  makes a great Birthday gift, and Xmas..<br />All the kids Love this Truck, and they know it from seeing it on tv.<br />Its a Big Hit.",

    "text": "When My Two year old Granddaughter saw this Radio Flyer Red Trike, her eyes lite up,BIG smile on her face,and she was speechless, for a Second!..<br />It is good looking. Very cute. She loves it.<br /><br />Although the Plastic tires are a disappointment with out groves in them. Since we live in the mountain, (as they do) on a few acres, the only cement to ride this on is our walkways around the house,<br />I Then thought she could ride this Radio flyer trike on our long loop Dirt drive-way, but its a bit hilly and the plastic tires are not good for traction on the Dirt, or any light mud going up a hill.<br />The wheels spin. With out traction its not as fun for her as I thought it would be. We have to push her around in some places.<br />The good part about the plastic tires are,they will not be popped by the stickers that<br />pop the other bikes the older kids ride around here.<br /><br />It was easier putting the Trike together then it was getting the box open, and that is no exaggeration ! It wasn't taped together, it was Glued,<br />and two boxes the Trike came in, It certainly is not damaged.<br />This comes with very good detailed instruction how to put this together..If my Husband can put this together anyone can.<br /><br />The little storage compartment in the back is durable plastic, and adorable for girls or boys. My Granddaughter put her dolly in there, with<br />some other goodies.<br />The seat will adjusts.<br /><br />If you live in a area with sidewalks, or have a Large deck the kids will love ridding this Trike, or even on level grass.<br /><br />I just want to mention, make sure your children have shoes on. I bought a larger Radio flyer for my older grandson (4yr) and he kept<br />hitting his toes on the cement when peddling . They gave that bike away in less then a month. (his toes where bleeding). They lived in Hawaii, and he was usually bare-foot.",

I'm thinking maybe a child that speaks english, can learn to speak some spanish with this doll!<br />Squeeze her hand and she speaks Allot. Her voice is loud and can be understood.<br /><br />The food that comes with this is like Plato, and it says it contains Wheat.<br /><br />I gave this to my 2 yr old granddaughter, who just had a baby sister this labor day, as we said this is a present from<br />your baby sister.That went over Great.<br />My Granddaughter Loves this Doll, Loves to feed it, and she rolls out the plato to make her food,<br />Baby alive chews the food, But be ready when your child changes the diaper. The play poop is a bit of a mess in small pieces.<br />Put down a little receiving blanket, or hand towel under the dolls tush so you do not have to pick up the little pieces of play food.<br />The doll is easy to underdress, & dress. This doll is keeping my Granddaughter busy, and she try's to copy her mother taking care of there new baby.<br /><br />I think this would make a fun Birthday gift, or holiday gift , or just a nice present.<br />It says 18 months or older. I think 18 months is a little young!<br /><br />It comes with starter batteries that do Not last long.  It uses 3 AA. batteries.",

Little flowers that move.<br /><br />I would not let a child use this to try and stand up, it will topple over. But you do not<br />have to put the tree type bottom on, and the child can sit and play.<br /><br />Its All wood, and such nice craftsmanship. I think this is a special toy, that is Not plastic from China.<br />This toy will be  handed down in my family for the other children to enjoy<br /><br />This also makes a very nice baby shower gift, or when you go see a new special baby. ( it is a bit pricey).<br />Its is Bigger and heavier then I expected.<br /><br />I recommend this toy,",

It comes with two batteries so that makes about 10 minutes of less of play time. Also, it's not good with carpet at all if you plan to use it for the 5 minutes. We have used this on leveled porcelain tile and it seems to last the longest on flat smooth surfaces.

    "text": "EDIT (7/3/21):  Star rating downgraded from 3 stars to 2 stars.  The photo provided in the box does NOT show sufficient detail in the very dark and blurry areas.  Assembly requires constant squinting at individual pieces to find minuscule identifying features. This jigsaw took me 2 weeks to assemble, instead of my usual 5-6 days for a seriously challenging jigsaw.<br /><br />This PUZZQUEST JIGSAW PUZZLE (1000 PIeces, “Stroll”) is one of the most difficult jigsaw puzzles that I've ever encountered.  It is difficult because (1) it has many similarly-colored pieces that are almost identically shaped; (2) the correct pieces do NOT click together solidly (unlike Ravensburger or other high-quality jigsaw puzzle pieces); and (3) at least half of the puzzle consists of out-of-focus greenery in dark, muddled colors.<br /><br />In assembling the “easy” border and left side (in clear focus) of the puzzle, I must have made 15-20 incorrect joins that needed to be corrected later.  Assembling by shapes is hampered by the similarity of neighboring pieces--absent a solid click-together, you can easily join two pieces incorrectly and build on them for a while before your error becomes apparent.  The colors of the pieces will NOT alert you to the incorrect joins.<br /><br />The puzzle is a very awkward size.  It is very tall, so you have to stand up and lean over it to work on the top quarter.  Be sure to measure your work area to make sure you have enough space to accommodate the height.<br /><br />The only reason to buy this puzzle is to prove that you're up to any jigsaw puzzle challenge.  To accommodate 1000 pieces, the photo is blown up so much that even the most distinct areas have several pieces.  Thus the assembly is slow-going, and not particularly enjoyable.  Pre-sorting the pieces doesn't help to speed things up, because half the puzzle consists of out-of-focus greenery in muddled dark colors.",

This is mildly annoying, because I like to turn questionably joined pieces over to check the fit from the wrong side--especially when the pieces are a solid color that requires assembly by shape.<br /><br />The puzzle picture looks exactly like the photograph on the product page.  There are large areas of bright color, and not much fine detail.  The picture is nicely printed on the puzzle itself.  The price (about $15 on Amazon) is very reasonable.<br /><br />I like this puzzle, because I like to assemble extra-difficult jigsaws.  However, I wouldn't recommend it for group assembly, because of the many pieces that are visually quite similar in color and shape.  Puzzles like this one require a lot of sorting of pieces in advance by color and shape if the actual assembly is to proceed fairly quickly.",

It's mostly made from recycled material, and printed with soy-based ink (both very good qualities in a cardboard product that will be used once or twice and then discarded in the trash).<br /><br />The puzzle is made of cardboard that is thinner than the cardboard in a Ravensburger jigsaw puzzle.  However, although Ravensburger puzzles represent the gold standard, the cardboard in the FRED puzzles is heavy enough to afford a quite acceptable puzzle-assembly experience.<br /><br />As a fan of “expert” jigsaws that are challenging to assemble, I really love the “Marshmallows” picture.  There are a lot of straight lines to help with assembly, but you have to look closely at the black areas on the individual puzzle pieces to place the individual marshmallows in their proper locations.<br /><br />For a picture like this one, a 500-piece puzzle is difficult enough to challenge even the most experienced jigsaw puzzle enthusiast.<br /><br />The puzzle comes in a sturdy, attractive storage box with a tight-fitting lid.  The box will stack easily, and won't come open and spill the pieces if you drop the box.",

Second, the puzzle pieces are always printed well--sharply and in full color.<br /><br />This puzzle comes in a small, square box (8” x 8”).  The puzzle itself is 21.25” wide and 15” wide, so that it makes a good-sized picture and fits easily on a card table.  The picture is easy enough to assemble, because of the many straight lines and white bands around the depicted trading cards.<br /><br />The puzzle is one of a series of Star Wars puzzles manufactured by Buffalo.

However, this THAMES & KOSMOS PEPPER MINT IN THE FANTASTIC UNDERWATER SCIENCE VOYAGE EXPERIMENT KIT is definitely NOT one of my favorites.  The experiments do teach about the physical properties of water (e.g., siphoning, hydraulics), but they are boring--mostly they require operating a syringe to push water through tubing.<br /><br />The boat is easy to build.  The parts are stamped onto thin sheets of wood.  You punch the parts out of the sheets, and the edges come out smooth and clean.  The parts then lock together without requiring glue or other fasteners.  The assembly instructions are included in a booklet that contains a silly adventure/discovery story that features the girl character Pepper Mint.<br /><br />The story is interrupted from time to time with instructions for science experiments.  Each experiment has a good, easy-to-understand explanation of “what's happening” (e.g., water can move things because, unlike air, it cannot be compressed).<br /><br />The kit is apparently aimed at 11-year-old girls (Pepper Mint's age), but the story and the experiments seem rather simplistic for that age group.  I do wish that Thames & Kosmos had chosen a more serious name than “Pepper Mint” for their girl scientist.  This kit has some teaching value, but it trivializes science for girls.",

    "text": "This KANO HARRY POTTER CODING KIT works as advertised.  It requires an app (Win10, FireOS, Android, iOS) for operation and play.  (The Kano Code app for the iPad seems to work well.)  The wand is fairly large--big enough to look and feel like a real magic wand.<br /><br />The kit includes a booklet with instructions for assembling the wand.  You insert batteries into a circuit board, put a button piece and the circuit board into a part of the wand, and close the wand with another piece.  Adding the last wand piece is a bit tricky, but the finished wand looks nice and doesn't fall apart.  A button on the end of the wand opens it up for battery changes.  Two sets of batteries are included.<br /><br />The app allows a child to create a Kano account, but sends an email to a parent's email address to allow the parent to set the child's privileges.  The app opens to an illustrated map of the Hogwarts campus.  The map has colored spots that you tap or select to open the “challenges”.<br /><br />For example, an early challenge teaches the child to change the colors on a drawing of an owl.  The coding is accomplished by dragging and dropping code blocks until they click together and add the color-changing capability to the wand.<br /><br />As an adult who knows almost nothing about coding, I didn't fully understand how the coding blocks went together or how the wand was supposed to be used once a new coding feature was added.  With a little more study time, I'm sure that I would have figured out how to do the coding.  However, if the wand is intended for a very young child, an adult with minimal coding knowledge will probably be required to help the child get started.<br /><br />The coding kit also includes a nice chart of the wand motions required to execute the spells used in the Harry Potter books and movies.  This kit should keep a child busy for hours, if the child is motivated to learn to use the wand.",

    "text": "This MOONLITE STORYBOOK PROJECTOR (Special Edition Disney Gift Pack, for Ages 1 and Up) is a flawed concept.  The projector is difficult to position over the flashlight on my Galaxy S10 phone, unless I turn the phone over and look through the lens at the light.  This burns an image into my retina, and is clearly not good for my eyes!<br /><br />The projector clips onto the phone, and exerts moderate pressure on the screen.  I don't like this, because I worry about cracking the screen.<br /><br />The projector works with the free “Moonlite” app (available from the App Store or Google Play).  You will have to register for an account to use the app.  After that, you must activate each set of story reels by entering an activation code--the code is on a small card packed in the box.  You tap the “unlock” icon at the top left of the app, and enter the code.<br /><br />Once you've activated the story reel set, you click on the story you want.  The app will then display a story for you to read to your child.  As you read each page, you advance the reel in the Moonlite projector, to get a new illustration for each page of the story.<br /><br />The projector shows a focused illustration (focus is adjustable), as long as you are no more than a yard or so away from the surface you are projecting to.  You cannot project the picture across a room, or for any great distance, because the phone's flashlight isn't bright enough to project for long distances.<br /><br />The photos that accompany the stories in the Disney set are boring, as are the stories.  Kids will no doubt love the Disney characters in the pictures (e.g., Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy), but the story illustrations are repetitious.  Also the detail in the illustrations gets lost because the projected images are fairly small.",

The “Minecraft” sets can be joined together, and they use standard LEGO elements that are compatible with all regular LEGO sets.<br /><br />A great feature is the twisty “mine shaft” inside the Creeper Mine tower.

(It reminds me of a coin sorter.)<br /><br />The set has Steve, blacksmith, and husk minifigs, plus buildable Creeper, cow, and bat figures.  There's a mine car that runs on rails, and TNT that blasts out bedrock.<br /><br />This set is a bit trickier to build than other “Minecraft” sets, but it's a satisfying build.

I strongly prefer the dramatic black-and-orange model, but I suppose the color schemes are true to the fighters' colors in the actual movies.  Both kits include a Poe Dameron minifig.  The current kit adds a minifig for Janna and one for a Knight of Ren.  The current kit has an R2D2 droid; the earlier kit has a BB8 droid.<br /><br />The fighter is fairly easy and fast to build.  It's a bit boring, because the four wings have many parts, but are quite similar in construction.  The model shoots studs from alongside the cockpit, and bolts from beneath the wings.  (This model strikes me as being more dangerous to the eyes than most of the bolt-shooting models, because the position of the launchers makes it hard to load the bolts without looking straight at the business end of the bolts.  Kids should maybe wear goggles when playing with this model.)<br /><br />When the model is properly constructed, the wings fold flat for non-combat flight, ground maintenance, and storage; and open into their combat X-configuration when you shift a lever from the rear to the front of the fuselage.  (The lever locks into place--if yours doesn't, just check the triple-armed connectors between the wings.  One of my connectors was dislodged from a rod during the build, so that the lever didn't lock.  Once the connector was reaffixed, the build became rock-solid.)  The landing gear folds up flat for flight.<br /><br />If you download the LEGO BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS app or the LEGO LIFE app, you can scan the Maze code on the cover of the instructions booklet and easily download the building instructions for this kit to a mobile device.  (The apps are available for iOS or Android, at the App Store or Google Play, respectively.)  The downloaded instructions are the same as the printed ones--there are no 360-degree views available, as with some of the newest LEGO sets.<br /><br />A reason to download the apps, is that they will keep a record of the sets you own.  If you ever need to know whether you purchased a particular set, or if you mislay the instructions and need them again for a rebuild, you will be able to retrieve that information easily.",

    "text": "This LEGO DUPLO MY FIRST ALPHABET TRUCK ((10915) New 2020, 36 Pieces) is aimed at very young builders, aged 18 months and up.  The DUPLO elements (NOT compatible with the elements in standard LEGO sets) are very large, designed for toddlers who are still developing their fine motor skills.<br /><br />The DUPLO truck holds 26 alphabet blocks--each block is printed with a single letter on one side.  This gives you and your child a complete set of alphabet blocks for teaching/learning ABCs.<br /><br />The blocks are so much more interesting than a “classic” set of alphabet blocks!  They can be stacked like regular blocks, and also loaded on and off the two truck trailers.<br /><br />The set includes three doll-like play figures:  a girl, a boy, and a teddy bear.  The set also includes a flat sheet with the alphabet blocks printed full-size, in A-Z order, for learning the order of the letters.<br /><br />Twenty-six of the thirty-six pieces are used for the alphabet blocks.  (There isn't much assembly required in this set.)  I wish that this delightful, versatile set had been available when I was learning my own ABCs!",

The easy-to-build set is aimed at builders aged 6 and older.<br /><br />Assembling the rods for the balloon cables is good pre-training for the challenging, adult-level Technic kits (which often incorporate the same rods and connecting elements).

    "title": "Another Fine Addition to City-Themed LEGO",
    "text": "This LEGO CITY RACE BOAT TRANSPORTER BUILDING SET ((60254) New 2020, 238 Pieces) is fairly easy to build--the difficulty is what I'd call “normal” for a City-themed set.  City sets are among my favorites, because they include fire trucks, police stations, buses, trains, beachgoer minifigs, space stations, and all the rest of the things that a bustling city (or the airspace above it) needs.  This particular set is aimed at ages 5 and up.<br /><br />The set contains all the pieces required to build three separate items:  a semi-trailer truck (for towing the race boat), a trailer for hauling the race boat, and a race boat.  (You can use the truck's trailer hitch to tow other things that you build, of course.)<br /><br />The “Xtreme” graphics are NOT printed on the pieces, but are applied with stickers.  (I hate stickers, too.)  Applying stickers is made easier if you first stick a corner to something long and thin (e.g., a spudger or a plastic knife) so that you can better control the placement on the element.  A good thing about LEGO stickers is that they can be removed and replaced (like Post-Its) if you get them misaligned.<br /><br />The LEGO elements are compatible with other City sets and with all regular LEGO sets (but not with DUPLO sets, which have extra-large pieces for very young builders).  The Race Boat Transporter set is another fine addition to the extensive collection of City sets.",

    "text": "This LEGO TECHNIC 4x4 XTREME OFF ROADER BUILDING KIT ((42099) 958 Pieces) produces a toy that is incredibly easy and fun to drive.  The off road vehicle is controlled entirely by an app (the LEGO Control+ app), which is available for free from either Google Play or the App Store.  It's probably easiest to install the app on your iOS or Android phone, so that you have an easy-to-hold device that feels like a game controller.<br /><br />The LEGO Control+ app has two control modes:  one-touch and multi-function.  One-touch shows you the vehicle, and you control the direction (forward, reverse, turning) by moving a finger on the touchscreen.  Multi-function shows you a dashboard with controls at left (turning) and right (forward, reverse).  Multi-function gives you easy access to a series of driving challenges (e.g., hairpin turn, etc.).<br /><br />The build itself is NOT particularly easy.  The instructions are clear, but there are places where it's tricky to insert everything correctly.  Once built, the Technic model is rock-solid--it won't come apart, even when you drive the vehicle over obstacles, or off a 4” high “cliff”.  (As with any Technic model, you should check each step of assembly carefully, because Technic elements don't come apart easily when you make a mistake.)<br /><br />There are three different motors in the model.  They are powered by six (6) AAA batteries (not included).  The vehicle is definitely NOT underpowered.  The kit includes a big sheet of stickers, which are reasonably easy to apply.  The vehicle shell is NOT printed at all--all of the orange/yellow patterning and sponsor ads come from stickers.",

    "text": "This LEGO ARCHITECTURE SKYLINES: TOKYO 21051 BUILDING KIT (New 2020 ; 547 Pieces) took me longer to assemble than it should have, because the building instructions are printed in white on a black background.  The model's base uses black LEGO pieces, so you need very good light to decipher the white-on-black drawings at the beginning.  I've assembled numerous LEGO sets, but had to restart this one after seriously misinterpreting the instructions for the base.<br /><br />Other than that, the Tokyo architecture model is interesting and fun.  There is quite a bit of studs-not-on top assembly, and there are some very innovative connective techniques.  Happily, the elements are printed with the graphics (no stickers to apply).<br /><br />Thanks to the innovative, amazing architecture that exists in real-life Tokyo, the finished model makes a terrific display piece.  For some reason, I really like the back wall of the model, which represents Mount Fuji.  The finished model is small enough to fit easily into a bookcase or wall-mounted display case.<br /><br />The instruction booklet includes photographs of the actual Tokyo buildings that are represented.  In addition, short text paragraphs (in English, French, and Spanish) explain the functions and backgrounds of the buildings.",

Adults can use this small set as a relaxing “fiddle” set.<br /><br />The all-blue set is a great way to introduce LEGO to someone new.  If the person enjoys playing with LEGO elements, then he/she can invest in larger sets later.<br /><br />The set contains standard LEGO pieces that are compatible with all LEGO building sets except DUPLO.

    "text": "This LEGO FRIENDS EMMA'S PLAY CUBE 41404 BUILDING KIT (New 2020 (36 Pieces)) will be appreciated by any kid or adult who loves miniatures and dollhouses.  It isn't much of a building kit, because there are only 36 pieces (including the doll, the surprise animal, the mirror, the hairbrush, the scissors, etc.).  Because it contains only a few classic LEGO elements, any creative play must come from doll play rather than from rebuilding the elements into something different.<br /><br />Of the three play cubes that I've assembled, Emma's is my least favorite.  The cube depicts a pet grooming and photography studio, so the furnishings are kind of static.  There is a mirror, a little laptop computer (a sticker gives it a display showing a choice of styles for the “client”), a camera on a stand, and a table for a pet to sit on during a photography session.  The right-hand half of the cube has a great background sticker showing a window with a view of the Eiffel Tower.<br /><br />The “surprise” consists of a cat figure in one of four colors (red, teal, gold, lavender).  I love the fact that this series has the same “surprise” animal in each themed cube, the “surprise” being the color of the animal.  This way there is no real pressure to “collect them all“ when it comes to the “surprises”.",

    "text": "Because I love all LEGO building kits for heavy construction equipment (e.g., [[ASIN:B07Y8T4WHC LEGO Mobile Crane]]), I couldn't resist this cute little LEGO DUPLO MY FIRST TOW TRUCK 10918 (New 2020 (6 Pieces)).  It's absolutely charming, all 6 pieces of it!<br /><br />I really like the drivers' windows, with a boy on one side and a girl on the other.  It makes this into a truly unisex toy.  I love the big blue traffic cone that fits between the drivers' cabin and the moveable crane for transport.  Tow trucks always set out traffic cones, for safety, when they're readying a tow.  The crane itself is fun because it swings up and down freely.<br /><br />The building instructions are on the outside of the retail box.  The toy takes about 30 seconds for an adult to assemble, as the wheels are already attached to the truck base.  When the toy is finished, it makes a terrific truck for general play.  The wheels turn freely, and the truck feels solid and satisfying when it's pushed around.<br /><br />Inside the box is a printed city street layout.  The paper is very thin, so this won't last long unless it's glued to some sort of heavier backing.  However the street layout fits the assembled tow truck, and is a nice detail.<br /><br />Note that this is a LEGO duplo model, intended for very young children.  The pieces are much larger than standard LEGO pieces.  They are compatible with other duplo building sets, but NOT with standard LEGO elements.",

    "title": "Cute, Portable Toy With Miniature Pastry Chef Has Lots of Play Potential",
    "text": "With only 44 pieces, this LEGO FRIENDS STEPHANIE'S PLAY CUBE Building Kit (New 2020 (44 Pieces)) isn't much of a building kit, but the finished project is a cute, portable toy that has a lot of play potential.  I love it because I love dollhouses and miniatures.<br /><br />When you open the finished cube, chef Stephanie is there in her bakery/kitchen, alongside a beautifully decorated cake. (Decorating the cake is a fun part of the build.)  She has cupcakes in the oven, and white icing is cooking on the stove.  Her little dog is there, too, watching the whole operation.<br /><br />There are really two builds in the cube, one in each half.  Both can be pulled out of the cube and placed on a table or countertop for play.  The oven door opens so you can remove the cupcakes, and the drawer underneath the cake holds extra decorations (flowers and bows).<br /><br />The background of the right half of the cube is supplied by a sticker that shows an apron hanging up, and a kitchen stool, among other things.  Only two stickers (the background just mentioned, and the oven door detail) need to be applied to LEGO elements as part of the “story”.  There are extra stickers to be used however the builder chooses.<br /><br />Something that I love about this play cube series, is that the “surprise” for each set is always the same animal, but in one of four different colors.  In this set 41401, the animal is a dog that may be red, gold, teal, or lavender.  I like my red dog, and am glad there is no real pressure to “collect them all“ when it comes to the \"surprise”, because it's only a matter of which color dog you get.",

    "title": "Smaller, Simpler Version of LEGO Pop-Up Book Tells Mulan's Story",
    "text": "As a child, I loved pop-up books, so of course I love all of the LEGO pop-up book building kits. The first one (see [[ASIN:B07GYB8D34 LEGO Pop-Up Book]] originated as a fan model submitted to the LEGO Ideas fan-voting site (if you want to participate, just google for LEGO Ideas).  This DISNEY MULAN'S STORYBOOK ADVENTURES 43174 BUILDING KIT (New 2020 (124 Pieces)) is a smaller, simpler version of the original pop-up book, but it's still a lot of fun.<br /><br />The basic pop-up feature is the arched bridge that goes from the center--the book's stationary spine, where Mulan's buildings are--to the little “tea service” island in the left half of the book.  The bridge goes up and down on a LEGO hinge, and snaps into place when the book is completely open.<br /><br />There are LEGO studs strategically placed around the open book, so that the three dolls, Mulan's pony, and Mulan's cricket cage can all be firmly attached at once.  This way, they don't rattle around loose (or get lost) when the book is closed to be put away.  When the book is open for play, the dolls fit on the bridge, under the arches, and can stand anywhere on the book surface.<br /><br />The assembly instructions are reasonably easy to follow--just look closely at the pictures.  I had to take my book covers apart and reassemble them because I got the left (blue water) and right (white land) sides switched, so that the water was on the wrong side when the book was opened.<br /><br />There are quite a few stickers, but only a few that need to be carefully placed on LEGO elements.  The instructions aren't terribly clear on where to place the stickers that go onto the book's interior surfaces (e.g., the swimming Koi fish, the lily pads, Mulan's bed roll, the campfire, the cooking supplies).  You can consult the box photos, or even the photos in the online LEGO Shop, if you want extra guidance for these.<br /><br />One of my favorite features is the two little tassels or bells that swing from Mulan's temple-like building.  I don't know whether this is an entirely new LEGO element, or whether it has appeared in other sets, but it was new to me.  There are enough LEGO pieces in the set to make the book interesting to assemble; and the book is fun to play with after it's built.",

    "text": "This LEGO SPEED CHAMPIONS 76895 FERRARI F8 TRIBUTO BUILDING KIT (New 2020 (275 Pieces)) is recommended for ages 7 and up, but very young children may need some adult help with this kit.  It takes some hand strength to add the tires to the hubs; and there are quite a few small left-oriented and right-oriented pieces that have to be placed just so, or the bodywork won't curve correctly (see my closeup photo).<br /><br />The finished Ferrari is cute, and solidly built for play.  The top comes off so that the minifig can sit inside.  There are no car doors that swing open (a feature that is standard on the big Technic car sets).<br /><br />The minifig comes with a wrench, and with both a helmet and a wig (the helmet does NOT fit when the wig is on).  There are two different sets of wheel covers for the Ferrari.<br /><br />The set takes an hour or two to build, if you're not in a hurry.  As always, the printed step-by-step LEGO building instructions are very clear.  You can also get the building instructions onto a tablet or other mobile device by scanning a maze code (included in the printed instructions) and then following the directions to download the appropriate app.",

    "text": "This LEGO FRIENDS MIA'S PLAY CUBE  (41403 Building Kit, New 2020 (40 Pieces)) is fun for any kid who loves doll houses and/or miniatures.  When you open the assembled cube, there's a little world inside:  Mia dressed as a veterinary, ready to vaccinate her little rabbit “patient”.<br /><br />The vet's office is decorated with three stickers:  a poster in the back of the right half, and a meter and a display screen with a rabbit pic  in the left half.  (There are bonus stickers that can be used anywhere a child likes--perhaps on the outside of the cube?)  The assemblies stay solidly in place when the cube halves are closed for travel.<br /><br />Something that I love about this set, is that the “surprise” animal for this set 41403 is always a rabbit, but a rabbit in one of four different colors.  I was happy to get a gold rabbit, but was relieved that I felt no pressure to “collect them all” when it came to the “surprise”.  The current play cube series sets have animal surprises as follows:  birds (41400); puppies (41401); mice (41402); rabbits (this set 41403); and cats ((41404).<br /><br />The furnishings in Mia's cube are easy to build, though you need to study the drawings carefully because there is NOT a separate step for each piece that is added.  When you're finished, you will probably have some extra single pieces left over (e.g., a few dots, an extra syringe).  However, if you have any two-stud pieces left, you' ve made a mistake and have left something out.",

    "text": "This LEGO IDEAS 21319 CENTRAL PERK BUILDING KIT (New 2019; 1,070 Pieces) started out on the LEGO “Ideas” website, where LEGO fans submit their own ideas for builds.  When a build receives 10,000 votes from individual LEGO fans (not as easy as you might think!), LEGO considers it for manufacture and release as a regular LEGO set, made available in retail stores and online.  (To find the site for participation in “Ideas” voting, Google for “Lego Ideas”.)<br /><br />The Central Perk set is true to the TV show that inspired it. The familiar orange couch is there, along with the coffee shop service bar, and the stage with standing microphone.  Minifigs represent Ross Geller, Rachel Green, Chandler Bing, Monica Geller, Joey Tribbiani, Phoebe Buffay, and Gunther.<br /><br />The thing I love most about LEGO building sets is the way that the square and rectangular bricks transform as you build into recognizable things (e.g., the orange couch).  I also find that building LEGO sets is relaxing, like assembling a jigsaw puzzle.<br /><br />As always, the step-by-step LEGO building instructions are crystal clear.  Do note that this Central Perk set has a LOT of small pieces (e.g., coffee cups, single- and double-stud plates, etc.).  This makes it a bit fiddly to build.",

    "title": "Simplified “Frozen” Ice Castle Set Has Light Brick!",
    "text": "[[VIDEOID:1c8150e87e66d2b60e0ec8095157a4f1]] If you're an adult, this LEGO DUPLO DISNEY FROZEN ICE CASTLE (10899; New 2019; 59 Pieces) takes less than half an hour to assemble, but it's a terrific set.  DUPLO blocks are intended for very young builders, and are much larger than regular LEGO blocks.  Thus this “Frozen” ice castle set lacks the detail of the regular  [[ASIN:B07TB4WCJM LEGO “Frozen” ice palace]] (see photos).  But this DUPLO set has a light brick!<br /><br />The light brick is powered by 3 button cell batteries (pre-installed).  When you press the button on the brick, it cycles through a series of colors for a short time, then stops automatically.  By repeatedly pressing the button, you can get all white lights; or all blue, red, yellow, green, purple, orange lights.  The batteries are replaceable, but you will need a small Phillips head screwdriver to open the light brick.  The batteries are NOT accessible to small children.<br /><br />In comparison to the regular LEGO set, the other great thing about this DUPLO set is the size of the play figures.  Elsa, Anna, and Olaf are much larger than regular LEGO mini-figures, so they're more fun to play with or display.  Elsa and Anna have skirts with elastic waists that go on over the plastic figures.  Elsa has a sparkly cape, and Anna has a dark red cloak.  Olaf is just himself!<br /><br />It's kind of amazing, how much the look and feel of the LEGO “Frozen” ice palace set is retained in this simplified DUPLO set.",

    "text": "This LEGO SYSTAR PARTY CREW BUILDING KIT (from THE LEGO MOVIE 2; Set 70848, New 2019, 196 Pieces) is kinda fiddly to assemble.  It has a lot of pieces, but they're mostly small pieces (1 or 2 studs).  Mixed in are some specialty pieces (e.g., Unikitty's cloud stole, the golden scallop shell, the piano keyboards) that require considerable creativity to be used in other projects.<br /><br />As an adult Unikitty fan (don't ask me why!), I love the new Unikitty figure.  She has fancy boots, and two different faces.  One face has sunglasses, the other has a starry-eyed expression.  Unikitty's cloud stole adds a touch of elegance.<br /><br />The finished pirate figure, with all of its one-man-band instruments, stands up solidly.  This is a tribute to the designer, because the arms and back have a lot of weight to support.  The arms and legs can be repositioned in their ball-socket joints.<br /><br />If you download the Lego Life app (available for both iOS and Android), you can scan the maze code on the front of the printed instructions and get building instructions for an “Intergalactic Drum Set” (see photo).  This uses parts from the basic build, and extends the building fun.  Scanning the maze code also provides the set's building instructions, in case you prefer to build from a tablet or cellphone display.",

    "text": "This LEGO DISNEY PRINCESS ELSA'S MAGICAL ICE PALACE 43172 TOY CASTLE BUILDING SET (New 2019; 701 Pieces) is a reissue of the previously discontinued 41148 set of the same name that was originally released in 2017 (also at a retail price of $79.99).  Some of the ad pages in the 43172 building instructions are different, but the models are the same.<br /><br />The Elsa's Magical Castle model isn't large, but it has loads of sparkle and detail; and tons of play potential in the many accessories (e,g., castle furniture, Olaf's train) and moving parts (e,g., swirling staircase, snow slide). It's one of my all-time favorite LEGO buildings--one that I have on permanent display (alongside my big Disney castle model).<br /><br />What I love most about Elsa's castle is that it incorporates a lot of transparent “Frozen blue” bricks, many of which have embedded silver sparkles.  I love shiny stuff, and Elsa's shimmering cape is something to behold.  I also love trains, so Olaf's train is another plus.  The little snowmen's teeter-totter (near the snow fort) is fun.  I don't really care for the scary snow monster, but it helps in reenacting scenes from the movie.<br /><br />Some of the model's sparkle is added with stickers, but there aren't a lot of stickers, and they're easy to apply.  There is a moving slide that opens and closes the tall castle front doors.  There is a spiral staircase that swirls open when you turn a knob.  The figures of Elsa and Anna are true to the cartoon figures in the Frozen film.  This is truly a great, classic LEGO set, based on a great, classic Disney movie.",

    "text": "One reason to like this SHIMMER & SHINE SPARKLE SPA! 70837 BUILDING KIT (from THE LEGO MOVIE 2; 691 Pieces) is that it includes a lot of the beautiful, sparkly, transparent blue elements previously seen in the LEGO “Frozen” kits.  Another reason to like it is that it includes a rotating platform for the vampire (or another minifig), and a transparent lever for emptying the spa tub (along with Unikitty or any other hapless tub occupant).<br /><br />Despite the high number of pieces (691), this is not a large model.  Many of the pieces are one- or two-stud elements or specialty elements (e.g., flames) that are mostly added for architectural decoration.  Still, the high piece count means that the model takes a while to build (always a good thing, in my opinion).<br /><br />As always, the building instructions are easy to follow.  The instructions can also be downloaded to an Apple or Android mobile device.  You use the LEGO Life app to scan the QR code (looks like a maze) that is printed on the box and the instruction booklet.  (The downloaded instructions are exactly the same as the printed ones.)",

    "text": "This REX'S REXPLORER! 70835 BUILDING KIT (from LEGO The Movie 2; 1172 Pieces) is a big kit that takes a while to build (a good thing, in my opinion).  The worst thing about it is the color choice of dark blue for the bricks.  Dark blue always makes the printed building instructions hard to follow--the printed black brick outlines merge right in with the blue of the bricks unless you have strong lighting.  The best thing about the kit is the little raptor figures, which have vicious-looking moveable jaws.<br /><br />At times the build is repetitive, because the Rexplorer has four wheels and corners to complete (like any LEGO vehicle).  I ran into one problem with the build:  For the four corners beginning at Step 115, you must add the assembled piece with studs DOWN to make a solid build.  I originally added the piece with the studs sideways, which didn't look quite right, and which made the area unstable later (pieces were easily dislodged with play).  The correct placement isn't clear from looking at the Step 115 page (see photos).  When built correctly, the Rexplorer is a robust model that holds together well.<br /><br />Once built, this set has a lot of play potential.  The Rexplorer has a cargo hold that opens at the side, and it's loaded with stud- and bolt-shooting weapons.  The vehicle also has cockplts that open to hold raptors or minifigs.  The set has Rex and Emmett minifigures with weapons, two brick-built Plantimals, and 2 raptor figures, plus a big weapon for a raptor to carry on its back.",

    "text": "At 1000 pieces, this SPRINGBOK EIFFEL MAGIC JIGSAW PUZZLE (1000 Pieces) is definitely an “expert” puzzle.  However, it goes together very quickly, because it has large blocks of unique colors--if you color-sort your pieces at the beginning, the jigsaw morphs into a series of much smaller jigsaws.<br /><br />My puzzle, received in March 2019, had ALL of the pieces.  No surprise, because I've assembled many, many Springbok jigsaws in my lifetime, and have never found one to be less than perfect.  (The negative reviews suggest that Springbok temporarily had a quality control problem with this puzzle design.  I sympathize with the people who received defective puzzles--even though Springbok will replace a defective puzzle, any guarantee is cold comfort when you finish a jigsaw and discover pieces missing.)<br /><br />Though I wasn't crazy about the picture, I ended up loving this jigsaw, and am saving it to put together a second time.  It's really fun to assemble, because the crazy-shaped pieces let you find fits by overall shapes as well as by design colors and patterns.  There are very few dark or ambiguous pieces that are hard to place in a particular area of the design.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't like about the puzzle is that two pieces frequently slide together side-by-side to make holes for the tabs of other pieces.  This means that when you assemble a small area (e.g., the pink automobile in the middle), you can't easily pick it up to move it to the correct location.  You have to slide the assembly across your tabletop, or slide a sheet of paper under the assembly to support it as it's moved.<br /><br />Note that this is a very large (30” x 24”) jigsaw.  Check to make sure that it will fit on your tabletop.",

The LEGO building instructions are always crystal clear, so that even the biggest sets with the most unusual building techniques are easy to assemble.  All that's required is that you set out the pieces for each step, and check your model against the picture before you go on to the next step.<br /><br />This big Voltron mech is made up of five smaller transformer lions, just like in the Japanese anime TV series and the later Dreamworks series.  This is the absolute best kind of big LEGO set, because the many elements and parts extend the building experience as long as possible. When you're done, you have a great model to display, and when you tire of the model, you have a lot of elements available to use for other projects of your own design.<br /><br />Volton comes out of the LEGO Ideas program, which means it was originally submitted to the LEGO Ideas website by a LEGO fan.  After the fan model received 10,000 supporting votes from other LEGO fans, it was selected to be sold as a regular LEGO set.  The Ideas sets are generally available for a limited time, so you should order Voltron fairly promptly if you love the set.<br /><br />Downloadable building instructions are always available at the LEGO website--look them up by the set number (121311 for Voltron).  However, the cheapest way to get all the necessary elements--and any specialized elements--is to buy a building set when it's still available from LEGO.

    "text": "This LEGO CREATOR EXPERT VESTAS WIND TURBINE BUILDING KIT (10268; 826 Piece) is a fascinating set that's much more fun than the advertising makes it appear.  Its best feature is also its greatest drawback--the huge turbine blades take a lot of space to display and operate.  The blades are motorized (with a servo hidden in the “Vestas” box at the top), and when they're turning, the two house entrance lights turn on.  What better way to dramatize the point that a single huge wind turbine can power thousands of homes?<br /><br />The model is slightly challenging to build, because it calls for a lot of studs-not-on-top assembly.  It's especially interesting to see how the heavy wind turbine assemblage is secured to the base with only LEGO elements.  The set does use specialized large green elements around the shaft to hide the battery box and to help hold the wind turbine firmly.<br /><br />The model also demonstrates the one feature that bothers me about wind turbines as a source of electricity--they are huge, and loom over their surrounding landscape.  The little house is dwarfed by the wind turbine.  The house is cute, with windows and door that open, a range and sink, a lamp on a table, and a patio with a table and chairs (created from “repurposed” wheel-well elements).<br /><br />The minifigs (two Vestas engineers, a female homeowner, and a dog) are great.  The engineers have a van that holds their work bench and a hand truck loaded with service tanks and a big assortment of tools.  The instruction book includes several pages describing the development of wind turbines as a power source, and showing diagrams of how they work to create electricity from wind currents.<br /><br />The wind turbine on the model can be rotated by hand atop the shaft.  Only the wind turbine blades are motorized.  The blades are operated by a switch at the bottom of the shaft.  The motor and lights run on 6 AA batteries (not included).  The trees in the set are made from plants.  (My LEGO Wind Turbine set was purchased from a LEGO Shop.)",

My favorite thing about the Unikitty cartoon is the ever-changing Unikitty expressions, so I'm delighted to get two new “faces” for my collection of LEGO Unikitties.<br /><br />All eyes and details on the figures (the ice cream cone, the chocolate bar, and Unikitty herself) are printed--there are no clumsy stickers to frustrate a small child.  This set is designed for children 5 years of age and up.  The elements are standard-sized LEGO bricks and plates (not DUPLO) that are compatible with all LEGO sets.<br /><br />The pictorial instructions are simple and easy to understand.  The set makes the three figures shown on the retail box, plus a charming tea cart accessory.<br /><br />.",

    "text": "The LEGO MOVIE 2 trailer suggests that EMMET AND LUCY'S VISITORS FROM THE DUPLO PLANET are destructive, evil creatures, but the figures you build from this 53-piece set (10895) are awfully cute.  The Duplo bricks are much larger than standard LEGO bricks, because they're designed for very young LEGO builders (ages 1½ to 5).<br /><br />This set is intended for children ages 2 and up, but it's fun for adults like me as well.  I love the scaled-up figures of Lucy and Emmet.  They arrive already assembled, but move just like regular minifigs--the heads turn, the arms move, and the legs bend to allow sitting or standing.<br /><br />The elements with the invaders' single eyes are printed, so there are no clumsy stickers to add.  The bricks come in bright crayon colors (red, blue, yellow, orange, green, red, purple, white).  There are simple, illustrated building instructions for all of the models shown on the box.<br /><br />THE LEGO MOVIE 2 is scheduled for release on February 8, 2019.",

    "text": "This THAMES & KOSMOS GIANT DINOSAUR SKELETON KIT is a child's building toy straight out of a parent's worst nightmare!  IF you are able to assemble the model, the large size is the only good thing about it.  There aren't many pieces; the pieces all lack detail; the front leg pieces are ridiculous, pathetic cutouts; and the skull and jaw are tricky to assemble.<br /><br />Perhaps my kit was defective, but the pieces were so badly manufactured, it was NOT possible to even build the T-rex model.  Only 3 of the 9 rib pieces would slide into the slots intended for them.  The other 6 rib pieces were simply too big to fit into their slots.  The only way to make them fit would be (1) to file down the rib pieces to narrow them, or (2) to file the slots to widen them.  Prying on the slots to open them wider only met with failure.<br /><br />Other joints in the model (e.g., the spine, the hips, the large legs) were hard to fit together, and took tremendous hand strength to press together and join.  A young child would NOT be able to “snap together” these pieces at all.  My dinosaur stood up--it balances on its tail when you position the legs just so--but a dinosaur without ribs is not anything you want to display.<br /><br />Even the manual was disappointing. The building instructions are all right, but the accompanying “scientific” explanations are nothing more than a collection of simplistic illustrated factoids.<br /><br />As a child's gift, this building kit is bound to disappoint, and is all too likely to produce tears of frustration and unhappiness on a child's special day or holiday.",

    "text": "It's possible to build this THAMES & KOSMOS GECKOBOT WALL CLIMBING ROBOT so that it will climb mirrors, but it's an incredibly fiddly build.  If you decide to try it, keep these things in mind:<br /><br />1.  Attach the legs so that they look EXACTLY like the drawings, with the small moving connector pieces standing parallel to the tabletop.  (The suction cups will be positioned without any legs lifted up.)<br />2.  Check your assembly with the legs attached to make sure that the legs move easily.  (Don't push the gears too tightly against the body pieces.)<br />3.  Make sure that the motor piece is attached with the orange circular part starting in neutral position (per the drawing).<br />4.  Position the red “pointer” cams with one pointing straight up and one pointing straight down when the legs are positioned as in (1) above.<br />5.  Position the two stacked red “circles” (the pieces that hold the short axle on top) so that the two little extensions are pointing in opposite directions.<br />6.  Position the top axle with the “x” in the position shown in the drawing.<br />7.  Attach the hoses so that the tops of the legs don't contact or catch on the hose loops when the model walks.<br /><br />My Geckobot walked smoothly across the tabletop, and stuck to a mirror, but walked only a few steps before it would slide down the mirror.  When I tried to follow the instructions for fixing this, the model came apart in places, so that a rebuild was needed.  (You really MUST build the model exactly according to the drawings.)  At that point, I put the project aside to fix at a later date.<br /><br />A problem with this model is that some of the connector parts are easily dislodged.  Another problem is that two AAA batteries don't seem to supply as much power as is really needed to drive this fairly heavy model.  My alkaline batteries actually heated up with the effort, and they couldn't drive the model if there was any drag on the moving parts.<br /><br />The batteries were NOT quickly drained with the effort.  Every time the “on” switch seemed not to be working, I removed the batteries and tested them.  They still were good, and they were still able to power the model after I made adjustments that eliminated drag.<br /><br />Kids will find this model frustrating, unless they really enjoy tinkering with something for as long as it takes to make it work.  I spent an extra 2-3 hours beyond what it takes for the build, just repositioning the cams and fixing the legs for smooth operation.",

    "text": "This THAMES & KOSMOS THE BIG ENGINEERING MAKERSPACE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT KIT is the real deal--a fun model-building kit that painlessly teaches basic concepts of physics (e.g., thermal air currents, levers, momentum).  Each model (e.g., crane, helicopter) actually works, and is accompanied by a “what's happening here” explanation in the manual of why it works (e.g., turning a crank hoists a crane load by exerting force on a rope threaded through pulleys that share the weight to be lifted; a helicopter's fast tail rotor produces a force that counteracts the main rotor's force to stabilize the helicopter).<br /><br />The models are assembled from plastic parts (some parts are similar to LEGO Technic elements) by following clear step-by-step diagrams (similar to LEGO building instructions).  They are powered by a pressurized air tank controlled by a switch with a lever.  There are no batteries to buy or charge, because you pressurize the air tank by pumping air into it (the pump assembly resembles a bicycle tire pump).<br /><br />Each model has suggestions for finding out more about the scientific principles that relate to it.  The manual indicates the difficulty level of each model with a three-dot system (easy, medium, difficult).<br /><br />This kit may seem expensive (about $90 on Amazon), but it teaches a LOT about the practical application of physical and engineering principles, for the price of a single medium-sized LEGO Technic kit.

    "text": "This UBTECH JIMU ROBOT-BUILDERBOTS KIT (Interactive Building Block System (357 Piece)) is so beautifully packaged, you'd almost think it was a smartphone or an Apple product.  It comes in a heavy-duty, magnetic-closure box that opens like a book.  Inside, the main controller, connectors and fasteners are packed in colorful paper boxes that nest perfectly in the big outer box.  Is such a lovely unboxing experience wasted on a kid's toy?<br /><br />This kit will make either a “Grabberbot” or a “Digbot”.  I say “either”, because the building components are extremely hard to take apart--you are NOT going to want to try a rebuild of either completed robot.  Some (but not all) of the components are similar to LEGO Technic elements, but they're smaller and definitely NOT compatible with LEGO.<br /><br />In an afternoon (about 4 hours), I built the Grabberbot, which I like a lot.  Using the Jimu app (iOS or Android), it's easy to drive, very responsive, and actually picks things up.  Grabberbot has a cool, multicolored LED light (you can program custom colors), and he has a voice cube with a large repertoire of sounds (also programmable).<br /><br />Grabberbot is controlled with Bluetooth--pairing is easy, once he's turned on or plugged into a power source.  He does NOT have a separate controller, so you must have a tablet or a smartphone to make him work.  (I use an iPad Mini.)  It's a good idea to charge the controller cube before you start building--it takes an hour or so.  You do NOT want to spend an afternoon building a robot, and then have to wait for the battery to charge before you can play with it!<br /><br />You can't build the Grabberbot without a tablet or smartphone--you have to download the app to get the building instructions.  (This is a pet peeve of mine; I believe that the instructions for building toys belong in the box.)  However, in defense of the download-only instructions, they are presented in 3D!  If you're unsure about a particular step, you can rotate the model 360 degrees and look at it from every angle until you're sure that you've got it right.<br /><br />Grabberbot is more difficult to build than a motorized LEGO set.  There are three reasons for this: (1) the instructions don't always show the elements recognizably or exactly the way they go together (e.g., the sensor box has fewer connector holes than the one shown in the instructions); (2) the instructions don't always start at the easiest place for the next step in the assembly; and (3) the components click together so firmly, you need pliers to separate some of them if you make a mistake.<br /><br />Sadly, the color-changing LED light needs to be programmed if you want it to do more than flash colored lights for a few seconds when Grabberbot is first turned on.  I did very little with the programming portion of the app, which requires you to identify which of the four servo motors you want to give instructions to (they are numbered), to choose commands for the motor(s), and to name and record the resulting<br />action.  Programming doesn't seem to be hard, but it does take some study and practice.<br /><br />There is a charger with an AC adapter included.  The red light on the controller box changes to green when the battery is fully charged.  A firmware update starts automatically when you first connect the Grabberbot; it takes only a few minutes.",

    "title": "Fun Set Builds Laboratory of Unikitty's Resident Mad Scientist",
    "text": "The LEGO UNIKITTY DR. FOX LABORATORY BUILDING KIT (359 Piece) is an inexpensive LEGO set (about $27 on Amazon) that has a lot of play potential.  With 359 pieces, it takes a while to build the laboratory of Unikitty's resident mad scientist (Dr. Fox), and there are many interesting features (e.g., the little “refrigerator” with the transparent door, and its contents).<br /><br />Taking center stage is the “sparkle matter” scanner from the second episode in the Unikitty cartoon series.  It's at the left side, and next to it is a little set of white rollers that make a conveyor belt for jars filled with sparkle matter.  At the far right is a turntable for filled sample jars that moves when you push it.<br /><br />The building techniques are easy, and the instructions are clear, so young children should be able to assemble the set.  There are a couple of stickers (Dr. Fox's blackboard, and her instrument panel) that will probably need adult assistance in applying.  The faces of the figures are printed on the bricks (no stickers required).<br /><br />The laboratory has a two big clamps that can hold a figure, an examination table (ditto), and various mysterious lamps and instruments.  The set includes Princess Unikitty, Prince Puppycorn, Dr. Fox, Richard, and a robot helper.  This Unikitty building set is a lot of fun (especially for an adult Unikitty fan like me).",

    "text": "The LEGO STAR WARS SANDCRAWLER BUILDING KIT (1239 Piece) is a kit for serious “Star Wars” fans, because it's basically a Tatooine garbage/trash truck.  There's not a whole lot of action surrounding a Jawa sandcrawler, but the LEGO model makes up for this by including many hinged and sliding panels that open up the interior to show Jawas and their salvaged droids and space junk inside.<br /><br />This set doesn't have a huge number of pieces (1239), and the finished model isn't particularly large (12” long, 7” high, 4” wide).  However, like all LEGO sets, it's interesting and fun to build.  My favorite part is the chains on the four tractor wheels--the elements are sort of fiddly to connect up, but the finished tractor chains are convincingly realistic.<br /><br />There are some Technic elements included to make the tractor wheels work, and to make it possible to steer the sandcrawler with an external gear wheel at the front.  Minifigs included are young Luke Skywalker, 2 Jawas, an RA-7 droid, an R5-A2 astromech droid, and a medical droid.<br /><br />If you want some shooting action, this set pairs nicely with the [[ASIN:B075SCRBQ6 Tatooine Battle Pack]].",

You will need three (3) AAA batteries (for the controller), and six (6) C cell batteries (for the engine).  Once the batteries are installed, you only need to set up the track (not electrified), and you'll have a fully operational model train.<br /><br />I love the diesel engine in this set, which reproduces the engine of the iconic “Santa Fe Super Chief” (the flagship of the old Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway). I hate the windows of the coach and observation cars. The windows are yellow, and some have old-fashioned, 1950s-style silhouettes that are supposed to be people inside the train. (The windows are exactly the same on both sides of the cars.)<br /><br />I don't know what Lionel was thinking--this set would be so much nicer without those ugly, distracting silhouettes.  It would also be nicer if there were a pullman car, since the train was famous for those.<br /><br />The train has the usual features of the battery-operated Lionel trains.  There is a working headlight, a train horn, and a bell. The controller is paired with the engine using Bluetooth, but you don't need to download anything to operate the train.",

The set is packed in a big, white LEGO storage box; the box is NOT completely full of bricks, but this means there is room to store other Unikitty sets if you purchase them.<br /><br />The bricks for the figures' heads are printed with their faces--small children won't need to apply stickers.  The set has three building instruction booklets with pieces in corresponding numbered bags.  (The presorted, numbered bags of pieces are standard with larger LEGO sets.)<br /><br />The many small building projects are great for very young children.  The building techniques are all basic, simple ones.  The elements in the set are all standard LEGO elements (they're NOT Duplo bricks), so they're compatible with other LEGO sets you may already own.",

I'm totally awed by the clever way that the wall is chained together and secured, so that it meanders up and along the grassy ridge.<br /><br />The kit took me about 2¼ hours to build, working steadily but taking time to read the factoids in the building instructions as I went along.  How interesting to learn that “sticky rice” used in the mortar contributed to the wall's longevity!  (Because this kit is part of the LEGO Architecture series, the instruction booklet has extras such as photos of the actual monument, a few pages of history, and some structural schematics.)<br /><br />The kit includes a large quantity of beautiful dark green bricks (hunter green) that make me want to think of something else to make with them--or with that color, if I don't ever want to disassemble the model.  I'm keeping the model for now, because it is very decorative when complete. (A nice feature is that there are two different “Great Wall of China” ID plates--one in English, one in Chinese.)",

I also like the use of a blue crystal element that becomes a fountain in a tiny park.<br /><br />The figures have their faces printed on special bricks (no stickers).  Unikitty has a wide, open-mouthed grin; her head turns, and she fits in a space in the cloud car.  Other figures are Square Bear and Feebee.<br /><br />Princess Unikitty was introduced in “The LEGO Movie”.  At first I thought that a hybrid unicorn/cat was creepy, but now I'm totally charmed by the “Unikitty” TV series that airs on the Cartoon Channel, and by the LEGO Unikitty sets.  I only wish that the Unikitty minifigs with different versions of Unikitty (see [[ASIN:B07BMF3K48 Unikitty Add-On Item]] were marketed as a straightforward collection, instead of as expensive grab-bag “mystery figures”.",

    "title": "Versatile, Fast Robot Is Somewhat Challenging to Build",
    "text": "This UBTECH JIMU ROBOT TANKBOT (Robot TankBot App-Enabled STEM Learning Kit (190 pcs)) makes a wonderful gift, because it's so beautifully packaged.  It comes in a heavy-duty, magnetic-closure box that opens like a book.  Inside, the main controller, connectors and fasteners are packed in colorful paper boxes that nest perfectly in the big outer box.  The unboxing experience is beautifully presented--it reminds me of unboxing an Apple product.<br /><br />The Tankbot is a very cute, sturdy little robot.  He's fast and responsive, and moves extremely well on his plastic tank treads.  He's controlled with an app (iOS or Android), using Bluetooth.  For me, pairing was almost instantaneous (once Tankbot was plugged into a power source).  He does NOT have a separate controller, so you must have a tablet or a smartphone to make him work.  (I use an iPad.)<br /><br />You can't even build him without a tablet or smartphone--you have to download the app and the building instructions.  This is a pet peeve of mine; I believe that the instructions for building toys belong in the box.  However, Ubtech should perhaps be forgiven, because the building instructions are written in something that resembles Autocad.  If you're unsure about a connection in a particular step, you can rotate the model 360 degrees and look at it from every angle until you're sure that you've got it right.<br /><br />That said, Tankbot is something of a bear to build--much harder than the most difficult motorized LEGO sets.  There are three reasons for this: (1) the instructions don't always show the elements recognizably or exactly the way they go together (e.g., the wires have a colored band that is on the wrong side in many drawings); (2) the instructions don't always start at the easiest place for the next step in the assembly; and (3) the components click together so firmly, you need pliers to separate some of them if you make a mistake.<br /><br />But the struggle is probably worthwhile, because you end up with a solid, programmable robot that you can drive around, use to pick up things, and spin in celebration (just like “Battlebots”).  Tankbot does take some practice at driving--I'm still learning the controls, but I'm not great at handling remote control toys in the first place.  I haven't tried the programming portion of the app yet--even the simple programming is something you have to learn--but I have no reason to think it won't work.<br /><br />Note that Tankbot's battery needs charging before you can do anything with him (including connecting to the controller app via Bluetooth).  There is a charger with an AC adapter included, and Tankbot charges fairly fast.  He does a firmware update automatically when you first connect him, if an update is available.",

The LEGO UNIKITTY PARTY TIME BUILDING KIT (214 Piece) takes less than an hour for an adult to build, but has some interesting building techniques for young children.  For example, the boxes for the two birthday gifts are constructed from slightly different LEGO elements--teaching that there can be more than one way to build something.<br /><br />I particularly like the Hawkodile figure, which has a specialized brick for the head with a protruding yellow hawk's bill.  The faces for Unikitty, Puppycorn, and Master Frown are printed on the specialized bricks for their heads.  The heads on all but Master frown can be turned for play.<br /><br />The birthday cake is on a trolley with wheels (like roller skates).  The round plate in front spins in a full circle to imitate a dance floor, and will hold one figure at a time. The only possible negative about this set is that there are four stickers (gift box bows and “Party Time”) that small children will need adult help with.<br /><br />My kit had quite a few extra small pieces.

The LED cube is the star of the kit, but it's worth having for lighting up LEGO builds that go way beyond the projects explained in the kit booklet.  All of the cubes connect with LEGO studs.<br /><br />Unlike many toy kits advertised as educational STEM kits, this kit has the building instructions packed inside the box.  There's no need to go online and join a club (and get your personal info entered into a database) to get the instructions, although there is a Circuit Cube Club available if a child is interested.<br /><br />The booklet with the projects is very clear and easy to follow.  The projects include flashlight; hand-crank flashlight; telescope flashlight; gobo; lighthouse; night light; spinning light car; desk lamp; shadow puppets; and motorized gobo.<br /><br />The kit has lots of different things for a child to try.  It isn't a kit that takes 5 minutes to assemble, 5 minutes to see what the build does, and 5 minutes to tire of it and set it aside never to be played with again.  The kit includes a small drawstring bag that is great for keeping the cubes and other parts together once the kit is unpacked.<br /><br />The one thing that I didn't like about the kit is that the booklet doesn't explain anything about how circuits work.  Whatever the child learns is going to come from trial-and-error experimentation with arranging the cubes.  I still don't know why my original connections for the hand-crank flashlight didn't work, except for the observation that they crossed to opposite posts instead of going in a straight daisy chain sequence.<br /><br />Something to watch out for if you're buying more than one of this series of kits is that you'll get the same three basic circuit cubes in some or all of them.",

    "text": "This LITTLEBITS BUBBLE BOT STARTER KIT (9 Piece) has everything you need to make a cute electric bubble-blower, but why is it so expensive?  (The kit is about $40 on Amazon.)  And at that price, why aren't the simple instructions included in a printed leaflet inside the box?  And at that price, why isn't the solid purple tube printed with the dragon/tiger/shark design shown on the packaging and in the advertising?<br /><br />I was able to produce basketball-sized bubbles, using dish detergent mixed with a small amount of water.  The instructions don't include a recipe for the bubble solution, so you have to experiment to get a soap bubble mixture that works.  The bot works best if you put the solution into a bowl (so you can pull the tube out freely).  To blow big bubbles, you need to speed up the fan gradually, using the dimmer slider.<br /><br />Assembling the bot is a snap.  You line up the circuit parts according to the photo in the instructions, and they click together because they're magnetized.  If they're lined up wrong, the magnetic poles will force them apart, so you know you must reverse one of the circuit parts.  An 8-year-old child can surely assemble this kit.<br /><br />However, I don't see how this kit teaches much of anything beyond clicking magnets together and flipping switches.  The instructions don't say anything about the physics principles involved.  Also, it was a big disappointment to find that the tube needs to be decorated by the kit buyer.  That might be okay if a stencil or template for the design shown in the ads were included, but there's nothing beyond the picture on the package.<br /><br />The printable assembly instructions that you get from the littleBits web site include a link to another bubble bot that you can build from LEGO bricks and some of the parts from this kit.  However, the LEGO bot requires a littleBits light sensor part, and this doesn't appear to be available for purchase except as part of an expensive set of littleBits components.  Too bad, as that bubble bot is more interesting than this one.<br /><br />UPDATE 08-06-18:  The pdf version of the assembly instructions (if you can find them--try Googling &#34;littleBits bubble bot instructions&#34;) has more STEM teaching information than the web site instructions that I used.  The pdf explains why the circuit components need to be assembled in a certain order, and shows photos of real-life devices that use the same types of components as the components in the kit.  Why these instructions are NOT included in the kit is a mystery to me.",

    "text": "UPDATE 08-04-2018:  My mistake re the leaflet link for the instructions--the ending after the dot is &#34;co&#34;, not &#34;com&#34;, so the link as printed does exist.  It doesn't change my star rating, though.  An adult or child still must create a profile on the kit manufacturer's site to be able to view the &#34;thirsty plant&#34; instructions.  In a high-priced kit (about $34 on Amazon), the instructions belong in the box.<br />-----<br />The first strike against this TECH WILL SAVE US THIRSTY PLANT KIT (Educational STEM Toy, Ages 8 and Up) is that there is NO instruction manual packed in the box.  The second strike is that the printed leaflet actually included in the box gives a web address for obtaining the manual that no longer exists.  (The company domain is available for purchase, as if the company were out of business.)  The third strike is that once you locate the online manual, the thirsty plant kit requires you to cast a columnar sensor from plaster of Paris (what a mess!), but doesn't include a stirrer or the soft clay needed to close the bottom of the mold during casting.<br /><br />If you want the instruction manual, you can Google “tech will save us thirsty plant kit”.  It appears that the PDF version of the manual no longer exists.  (At least my browser wouldn't open the pdf file from the link that Google brought up.)  However, there is an online instruction manual available (as of 08-04-2018) if your child--with adult permission--signs up for a free membership in the kit maker's “Club Make”.<br /><br />The third strike is a little unfair of me, in that the product page listing mentions the use of plaster of Paris.  However, if you haven't made anything with plaster of Paris in years, you will end up with a horrible mess on your work table.  It doesn't help that the instruction manual says to pour “a thumb” of water into the included dish for mixing, when you actually need about ¼ of that (or about ½ of the amount shown in the photo). I guess the manual means a child's “thumb”.<br /><br />If you succeed in making the water sensor--which needs to dry for 24 hours before you can continue assembling the kit--then putting together the circuitry seems fairly simple.  I do wonder whether an 8-year-old can do it without adult help, though.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the completed water sensor will work as advertised, and flash a LED light (in the daytime only) when a potted plant's soil dries out.  Unfortunately, I can't say for sure that the sensor works, because I bombed out at the sensor-casting stage.",

It even delivers “dino gas” when you press and hold the nose and back of the head.<br /><br />Mine works perfectly out of the box, and is mesmerizing.  With a little practice, I was able to get consistent responses from my little guy (e.g., tapping 1, 2, or 3 times on the nose would consistently produce the same sounds and behavior, depending on the number of taps).  The easiest actions are the transition from untamed to tamed (stroke from nose to back of head) and tamed to untamed (press and hold back of head).<br /><br />I can well believe that a child would be very, very disappointed if the raptor suddenly stopped working, so parents should be prepared for this possibility.

    "text": "This HOT WHEELS TRACK BUILDER STUNT BRIDGE KIT is fun for lovers of drawbridges and motorized models (like myself).  The main drawback is that it takes up so much floor space.  If you already have a Hot Wheels Track Builder layout, you can connect this stunt--nice because the escape from the stunt is an upward-pointing launch ramp.<br /><br />There are clear instructions for assembly.  If you follow them carefully, the stunt will perform as promised.  Despite the dual-car launcher, this kit comes with only one car.  Fortunately, Hot Wheels cars are fairly cheap, but I cannot understand why the bigger, more complicated Hot Wheels sets are always released with only one car.<br /><br />The set requires two D-cell batteries, which are NOT included.  This kit is NOT a good choice for Hot Wheels newbies, even though it's attractive and fun.  You get the most bang for your buck with the starter kits like the [[ASIN:B01JMYP9OQ Hot Wheels Track Builder Stunt Box]].  You can add all sorts of track builder stunts to the basic set later, and choose the stunts to fit your available floor space.",

The stunt is fun by itself, but also connects to the track in your existing Hot Wheels layout, if you have one.<br /><br />The stunt uses standard Hot Wheels cars.

    "text": "This ETA HAND2MIND 20-BEAD REKENREK (with Activity Guide) is a solid, beautifully made wood-and-metal counting frame.  The beads feel nice, and slide easily.  The frame is accompanied by a teaching manual that includes lessons, number “cards” to be cut out and mounted on heavier stock, and student problem worksheets for duplication.<br /><br />The Rekenrek is intended to help students visualize numbers.  I found the lessons hard to follow at first—an important element is understanding that the starting “Home” position is with all the beads on the right. If taught correctly, I can see how the Rekenrek would make early math classes (K-2) more tactile and fun.<br /><br />The Rekenrek isn't expensive (about $15 on Amazon), considering how well-made it is.  However, it will cost a fair amount to equip a class for “Rekenrek math”.  One Rekenrek is required for each student, and one for the teacher.",

It's nice that you can steer it with a handheld remote, or with voice commands, or even set it to follow behind you (as you wear the remote).  But for me, that gets old very fast.<br /><br />This toy also requires a lot of storage space.  The lower ball is bigger than a basketball (more the size of a small floor exercise ball).  The overall height is something like 18”.  It's also rather heavy (more than 10 lbs.).  Both the head and the body require charging, which is kind of a pain.<br /><br />The Hero Droid BB-8 is very realistic, and mimics the movie experience.  However, it's a space hog, and I think that a smaller, table-sized BB-8 is more fun.",

Elastigirl is interesting to minfig lovers, because her body element is molded with long tubes (solid plastic) for arms,  instead of having the standard poseable arms.<br /><br />The set has reasonable play potential, with a helicopter and a motorcycle (the Elasticycle) for zooming around.  Both vehicles have space to accommodate a minifig operator.  A cute graphic element is the hypno-disc on the helicopter's propeller.  The brick-built scenery (billboard, satellite dish, antenna, and helipad) inspires the acting out of many different creative stories.<br /><br />LEGO Juniors building kits use standard LEGO pieces, but have slightly simplified building instructions with extra illustrated steps.  The kits also use fewer brick-built components (e.g., a baseplate may come with two levels molded in), and have printed graphics rather than tricky-to-apply stickers.  The bricks may come in more colors, to aid in assembly.",

    "text": "This LEGO STAR WARS KESSEL RUN MILLENIUM FALCON BUILDING KIT  (75212; 1414 pieces) is a great set—definitely one of my all-time favorites.  When completed, the kit produces a large, heavy but solid, fun-to-play-with model of the “Kessel Run” Millennium Falcon that's featured in the new Han Solo movie (“Solo:  A Star Wars Story”, released on 5/24/2018).  As an adult, I really love this Millennium Falcon, which has a large removable space shuttle in front that accommodates a minifigure, and two powerful, spring-loaded bolt shooters.  The bolts always fly 18” or more (you get four bolts).  There is also a gunnery pod for minifigures in the center circular area.<br /><br />The build is fairly demanding, which makes it a lot of fun for experienced builders.  The parts you assemble aren't always symmetrical, and there are a lot of left- and right-handed components, so you have to pay attention to the instructions as you build.  There are some “studs not on top” segments, and some components (like the removable transparent nose cone) that are attached “sideways” to vertical studs.  There are also a few items (e.g., the lever-action doors at the top front) that attach with Technic parts.<br /><br />Most of the “triangular” pieces on the top of the model swing up for easy access to the furnished interior.  Inside there are chairs that accommodate minifigures, control panels (done with stickers), coffee bars, and engine parts storage boxes.  The stickers aren't excessive, and are easy to position.  (I use a thin, flat, metal spudger to pick up and place the stickers accurately.)<br /><br />The set has several specialized bricks that I haven't seen before (e.g., the bricks that form a channel for the space shuttle to slide in and out of the front of the model).  It also has some unusual building techniques that are used to link together pieces that are installed along a curved line.  The model has four sturdy feet, which allow it to stand on a flat surface with space for the underbody gun turret.<br /><br />The set has only 1414 pieces, but many pieces are very large (e.g., the triangles that open on top).  The finished model is a big, substantial toy (the circle is 12” across).",

It's aimed at young children, and it really hits the mark.  I think that any child who is able to read the simple instructions should be able to make his/her own LEGO movies, and that even younger children can make stop-motion movies with adult help.<br /><br />The book includes LEGO parts, background scenery, and basic scripts to get the reader started with a few simple movies, using animation apps that are loaded with cell phone cameras or that are readily available online as free downloads.  My favorite feature of the book is the deck of “scene cards” that can be removed and photographed in sequence to test the performance of the reader's chosen animation software.<br /><br />If you perform this “scene card” test, you will master the basic photography skills needed, before you invest a lot of time setting up your stop-motion frames with actual LEGO pieces.  This book isn't just for kids, either—it's a great starter book for anyone who's interested in learning how to create his/her own LEGO movies.",

The center portion with the monastery buildings and their reflection goes very quickly, but the four outer corners are a total slog.<br /><br />At least half the puzzle is pale blue or white sky/sea. There is little in the way of color differentiation, so the only way to put the pieces together is to eyeball the shapes.  You can speed this up a little by sorting the blue/white pieces (e.g., 2-tabs, 3-tabs, 1-tab with squarish “foot”, etc.).  But it will still take a long time, and close study of individual pieces, for even an expert jigsaw assembler to complete the picture.<br /><br />Like all Ravensburger puzzles, this one is high quality, with 1000 totally unique pieces.  The pieces click together smoothly, so you always know immediately when you've located the correct piece.<br /><br />This very difficult puzzle will teach you a lot about the pattern Ravensburger follows in cutting its jigsaws.  If you love jigsaw puzzles for the pure challenge, this is the puzzle for you!",

    "text": "This LEGO FLOWER DISPLAY SET (100 pieces (40187)) is a quick build that produces a charming pair of bright-colored potted flowers (a rose and a daisy) for your desk, bookshelf, table, or windowsill.  You can use the simple instructions as the basis for your own designs for other flowers to add to your little “garden”—the flowers use standard LEGO pieces.  (Use the set number above online at the LEGO website to identify the specific “replacement pieces”.  The set is listed at a lower price (less than Amazon's $19) on the website, but it was sold out at the time of this review.)",

    "text": "This PETIT COLLAGE RABBIT WOOD STACKING TOY works well for my unusual purpose—to give my stroke-disabled husband a new and different hand-therapy challenge.  The rocking base makes it slightly harder to stack the wooden pieces onto the center post.  The fact that the differently shaped and colored pieces are stackable in any order (except for the rabbit's head) adds visual variety to the therapy exercise.  The wooden parts are durable, and the rabbit is seriously cute.",

    "title": "Great “Quick” Project for Jigsaw Puzzle Expert",
    "text": "This RAVENSBURGER VIEW OF TOWER BRIDGE JIGSAW PUZZLE (1000 Piece) is a great “quick” project for a jigsaw puzzle expert.  It took me about 2½ days, working several hours at a stretch in four or maybe five extended sessions. (I get kind of compulsive about jigsaw puzzles, always hunting for “just one more piece” before stopping.)<br /><br />The puzzle consists of five main parts: the water and tower bases (easy because of the colors); the tower decks, suspension cables, and pedestrian walkways (easy because of the colors, patterns, and straight lines); the towers (moderately difficult because there are two similar towers); the autumn leaves (hard, because there are a lot of similarly-colored pieces with “abstract” patterning); and the sky (hard, despite the clouds, because there are a lot of pieces to place by subtle color differences and by shape).<br /><br />These different sections draw on all of an expert's skills, but there aren't so many pieces that the assembler gets sick of the photo before finishing the puzzle.  One thousand pieces make the puzzle a lot more challenging and satisfying than an ordinary 500-piece tabletop puzzle, but the photo is an easy one that reduces the difficulty level.<br /><br />As always with Ravensburger puzzles, this one is excellently made, with unique pieces that fit together in only one way.  The soft-click connections tell you immediately whether or not you have joined the correct pieces.",

    "title": "“Build and Swap” Advertising Seems Overstated",
    "text": "What I like about this LEGO DISNEY PRINCESS MULAN'S Training Day 41151 BUILDING KIT (104 Piece)—which is obviously marketed to girls—is that it features a strong, active female.  Mulan is at home, but her home features a sword, a catapult, and a spinning training dummy, not just a cherry tree in bloom, a fan, and a tea set.  The foal Khan is included, though Mulan can't ride (she's wearing a skirt).<br /><br />What I don't like about this set is the “Build and Swap” balloon on the box.  LEGO pieces are generally interchangeable, so it made me think that this set was part of a Mulan series of similar sets.  But it isn't—the other 2018 Disney Princess sets are Sleeping Beauty's Fairytale Castle, Ariel's Royal Celebration, Cinderella's Dream Castle, and Elsa's Market Adventure.  None of these are compatible, theme-wise, with the Mulan set.<br /><br />Apparently “Build and Swap” merely refers to the fact that some of the completed elements (e.g., cherry tree, catapult) can swap positions in Mulan's home.  (See my photo.)  This doesn't seem interesting enough to warrant special advertising, especially advertising that suggests the child needs to collect more sets for swapping.<br /><br />Priced about $15 on Amazon, this small LEGO set is affordable as a gift, but isn't exactly cheap. However, anything with the “Disney” trademark always costs more, and it's a cute little set that Mulan fans should enjoy assembling and playing with.",

With 198 pieces, there are a lot of parts to identify, so it will take longer for anyone new to LEGO.<br /><br />It's a highly varied, satisfying build, even for an adult.  There is quite a bit of sideways building, and there are some combinations that take some attention to figure out.  As always, the instructions are clear.<br /><br />The finished Bat-Dune Buggy shoots LEGO dots from side-mounted guns.  There is a rubber-band suspension that is activated by pressing down on the tail fins. It's a fairly solid build, though the back section can pop off if you press too hard.  The buggy has big wheels that turn.  (You may need to turn the front wheels by hand at first to loosen them up. The front wheels are not mounted on an axle like the back wheels.)<br /><br />There are two minifigs, Batman and Boomerang Man.  Batman's head has two faces with different expressions; the minifig has a marvelous fabric cape.  Priced about $16 on Amazon, I think that this set returns good value for the money.  When finished, the Bat-Dune Buggy is fun to play with.",

He stands about 4” high, and arrives attached to a solid plastic base, under a clear plastic dome.  You may want to save the domed box, because it doubles as a nice display case.  The figure attaches to the base with easy-to-turn plastic bolts (use a coin, such as a quarter).  The dome has a hole in the top that lets you reach in to change the figure's three expressions by pushing down on the head.<br /><br />That's all it is—a Hulk figure with three different cartoon expressions—but it's cute, and I love it.  It seems to be solidly constructed, and it will probably stand up to a reasonable amount of abuse in the course of children's play.  It does stand up on its own when removed from the base.",

They're the most versatile, because they can be connected into all sorts of different layouts.  This HOT WHEELS STAR WARS MILLENNIUM FALCON PLAYSET (with Movie Ticket) was kind of disappointing, because it comes with only one Star-Wars-themed truck (Chewbacca).  Without purchasing more of the character cars and trucks, you can't come close to the exciting, fun experience promised by the product page ad video.<br /><br />The set is simple to assemble, but there are a LOT of stickers to apply.  This playset can be attached to other Hot Wheels playsets, but it's mostly a standalone Star Wars shoot-em-up-and-crash-em toy.  There aren't a whole lot of play options (although there are more options than with most HW stunt playsets).  The sound effects consist of shooting sounds and Chewbacca wails.<br /><br />Priced around $50 on Amazon, it doesn't deliver a lot of bang for your Star Wars buck. (I think that Millennium Falcon toys without the cars and chutes are more versatile and fun.)  Of course any Star Wars toy costs extra because of the Disney licensing fees.",

To carry out the carnival theme, Cleo holds a pretzel, and Deuce has an apple on a stick.  Both figures can ride on the Scaris Wheel.<br /><br />The Scaris Wheel and its supporting tower are decorated with little skulls.  There is a ticket booth that attaches to the wheel tower and swings out (or can be removed to stand alone).  I love the dark-charcoal-and-blue-mottled bricks that are used in the support structures.<br /><br />In my experience, Mega Bloks are slightly harder to assemble than LEGO bricks.  The don't seem to be manufactured with the same precision, so they don't snap together cleanly.<br /><br /> Also, the Mega Bloks assembly directions are harder to follow than LEGO instructions, because they are written as “exploded” add-a-brick diagrams rather than as diagrams showing how the model looks after each brick is added.  Still, learning to understand exploded diagrams will stand kids in good stead when they grow up and start assembling furniture!",

    "title": "High-Quality Building Set, But Builds Don't Look Much Like Intended Things",
    "text": "This CLICFORMERS BASIC SET (150 Piece, Multicolor) is a high-quality building set.  The pieces are solid, uniform, smooth-edged, and easily snapped together.  However, the pieces aren't particularly versatile--most builds seem to use a chain of connected basic pieces rolled or wrapped around an accessory piece, or folded into boxes.<br /><br />Also, the finished builds don't look much like a “duck” or a “penguin” or a “necklace” or a “truck”.  It takes imagination to see the build as the thing it is intended to be.  To me, the builds always look like an aggregation of Clicformers pieces, instead of transforming visually into an entirely different object.<br /><br />This set includes a booklet of clear instructions for a variety of builds.  There is also a sheet of stickers to apply to the pieces, either for decoration or for birds' or animals' eyes.  The set is fun to play with, if you like building toys.<br /><br />I think that LEGO sets give better value, because you can build so many different, recognizable things from the basic bricks (LEGO, or LEGO Duplo for younger children), without needing a lot of special connectors.  If Clicformers offer something that LEGO doesn't, I don't know what it is. Clicformers certainly aren't cheaper (as are K'nex and Mega Blox building sets).",

    "text": "This BARBIE 2017 HOLIDAY TERESA DOLL (Brunette) has beautiful brunette hair, with light brown highlighting to add interest.  The full-skirted, full-length gown, made of dark red, sparkly metallic fabric, is to die for, with the skirt slit to above the knee.  The earrings are lovely (though they don't actually move like dangly earrings, because they're made in one piece from plastic).<br /><br />The doll is intended more for display by collectors than for play.  Both arms move at the shoulder joint, but the left arm is permanently bent into a hand-on-the-hip pose.  The hair is very fragile--some of it started to fly away even as I was removing the doll from the box.  The doll comes with a nice little stand.<br /><br />The giant star has costume jewelry “rubies” set into the points--very pretty.  The star attaches to the gown with two prongs that fit into loops on the back of the bodice.  (The star doesn't quite work as a tree ornament, because of the prongs.)<br /><br />Removing the doll from the box is a job for an older child or an adult.  The cardboard backing (carrying the doll) is held inside the clear plastic display box with plastic tabs that must be flattened to release the backing.  Both the skirt of the gown and the doll's long hair are sewn to the cardboard backing.  The doll's head, waist, hands, and feet are secured by clear plastic bands and tabs that are taped to the backing.  Clipping all of these “restraints” requires fine scissors, a good eye, and a steady hand to avoid damaging the hair or gown.",

This LEGO “FUN AT THE BEACH” BUILDING KIT (60153) gives you a wide selection of minifigs attired in swimsuits, wetsuits, and playsuits, with appropriate accessories.<br /><br />As always, it was fun to see how the brick-built accessories (sand castle, lounge chair, volleyball net, lifeguard tower, beach umbrella, ice cream stand, hammock) transformed from regular LEGO bricks into things that looked like something else.  This set has a lot of specialized accessory bricks (metal detector, sand pail, Dalmatian dog, porpoise, lobster, kayak with paddle, windsurfing board, banana, fish, shovel, volleyball, camera, binoculars, boombox, cellphone, bullhorn) that are nice to have.<br /><br />The minifigs can be assembled per the instructions, or mixed and matched.  There are people of different ages (from grandmother to kids), and many different hairstyles (short, long and loose, braids, buns) in different colors (gray, brown, beige, yellow).<br /><br />These beach-attired minifigs are just what you need if you're creating your own ocean- or beach-themed models from regular LEGO bricks.",

    "text": "I'm a lover of the really big LEGO sets, especially the Creator buildings (e.g., Cinderella's Castle; the Detective's Office) and the Technic heavy construction equipment models (e.g., the Bucket Wheel Excavator).  In my opinion, this medium-sized set, the DISNEY FROZEN ELSA'S MAGICAL ICE PALACE (41148) is one of LEGO's very best efforts.<br /><br />The set has lots of beautiful transparent blue bricks, and a couple of specialized large panels for the castle that are transparent blue with embedded silver sparkles.  The transparent blue bricks exactly match Elsa's blue from the “Frozen” movie.<br /><br />If you've seen the movie, you will love the spiral staircase that expands and rises up with a twist of the ball at the top--very much like the icy castle walls that rose up magically in response to Elsa's sweeping movements in the movie.  As is always true with LEGO sets, it's fun to see, as you build, how the simple bricks become furniture, chandeliers, doorways, and other details.<br /><br />The set has minifigures of Olaf, Elsa, Anna, a snow monster, and small snowmen.  The balconied castle is furnished with a chandelier, a bed with coverlet, a table and chairs, a music stand, and a kitchen.  Stickers printed on sparkly silver paper go onto the moving castle doors to complete the dazzling look of the ice palace.  And despite all the detail, this set is fairly easy to build.",

    "title": "Hard-to-Identify, Hard-to-Set-Up Buildings Destroy Fun of Assembling Kit",
    "text": "This 4D CITYSCAPE CHICAGO SKYLINE PUZZLE is great in concept, but falls way short in the execution.  It's a three-part puzzle.  First you assemble a standard jigsaw (an 1867 Chicago street map).  Next you assemble a foam-based jigsaw with identical interlocking tabs (a modern Chicago street map) that goes atop the first jigsaw.  Third you add three-dimensional plastic buildings to the foam jigsaw.<br /><br />The first jigsaw is difficult, especially in the large blue Lake Michigan area, but the street names and the boats on the lake help enough to make this an expert-but-fairly-easy jigsaw.  The second foam jigsaw comes partly assembled, with several large pieces, and is very easy, taking less than an hour. (Unless you separate all the smallest foam street-grid pieces, which will require a lot of close comparison with the color map, and a lot of extra unsatisfying puzzle time, to reassemble.)<br /><br />The third part, adding the buildings, is where the whole puzzle concept breaks down.  Unless you're familiar with Chicago already, the buildings are hard to identify by comparing the plastic pieces with the photographs on the color buildings poster.  You have to identify each building by finding its numbered location on the color map, and then matching the appearance of the roof to the line drawing of the roof found in the punch-out foam puzzle piece at the location in the foam map. (With some similar buildings, this is quite difficult, and you have to check the size of the plastic bases as well.  It also helps to know how to read architectural diagrams.)<br /><br />Finally, inserting the buildings is a major problem.  If you punch out the foam piece where the building goes in, you will NOT be able to tell how the building is oriented to the street and the buildings around it.  If you don't punch out the foam piece, but merely jam the building down onto it, the building will fall over whenever you jostle the foam as you add more buildings.  Another problem is that some historic buildings are gold and the rest are silver-gray.<br /><br />The puzzle kit also includes a set of silver-gray &quot;generic&quot; buildings that you can add to make the Chicago downtown look more like a skyscraper city.  However, you don't know when these buildings were built, so inserting them destroys the historical timeline that helps you see how Chicago grew.<br /><br />I was really excited about this puzzle, because I wanted to see all the buildings added after I departed Chicago in the sixties.  However, adding the buildings was fiddly and far too much of a hassle, so I bailed on the project after 25 buildings.  (If I ever decide to go back and finish it, I will glue the buildings in place atop the foam.)<br /><br />In sum, although the standard jigsaw is fun to assemble, it is overpriced at the cost of the entire kit (about $30 on Amazon).  The rest of the kit was a big disappointment. Now I think I'll try to find a book of photographs that will show me how Chicago has grown since 1867, or since the sixties.",

    "text": "Unlike the other reviewers, I found the manual for this THAMES & KOSMOS GYROSCOPES & FLYWHEELS SCIENCE KIT to be fascinating.  The experiments are interesting, and the explanations of the physics principles that are demonstrated by the experiments are clear enough.  The assembly diagrams were also easy to follow, once I understood that the gyroscope and fly wheel come already assembled, and once I found the instructions for using the zip cords (on the opening booklet page, not counting the cover).<br /><br />However, there can be no forgiving the fact that the building pieces are hard to fit together.  This is a manufacturing problem that needs to be fixed.  The manual is of little value unless the experiments can be performed--the manual and models are meant to be used together to teach the scientific principles.",

    "text": "This year's Amazon collectible bear, the GUND 2016 PLUSH BEAR, may be the cutest yet!  I love the red snowflake-print hat and mittens.  The bear is a little bit smaller than the 2015 bear (with the red-and-white striped cap).  It is a good-sized, high-quality, Gund bear that is very soft and cuddly.  The Amazon logo is embroidered on the bear's left hind foot.<br /><br />I think this bear gives great value for the money (about $19 on Amazon).  Amazon usually offers the bear free with various toy and gift card offers, but I'm a collector, so I ordered mine early (before Black Friday).  Last year's bear sold out very quickly (before December 25).",

    "text": "This BRIO DELUXE BIRTHDAY TRAIN is a cute, sturdy toy, with both wooden and plastic parts.  I love the idea of using this toy as the centerpiece in a small child's birthday celebrations (ages 1-6 years).  What a nice family tradition that would be!<br /><br />The train is a little large for a table centerpiece, but the large size means it will photograph well when it's displaying a child's age on his/her birthday.  The set includes wooden blocks with numbers 1 to 6, but you don't really have to stop at 6 years. You can easily draw or print the rest of the numbers you need (0,7,8,9, and duplicates of 1 through 9), tape them over the blocks, and set up as many as two number blocks in the two cars.  You can celebrate birthdays from 1 to 99!<br /><br />Also, I think that a small child would have a lot of fun playing with this colorful little train.  The two cars couple and uncouple easily, and have a lot of room for loading in small toys like zoo animals or building blocks.  When the locomotive and cars are coupled together, the wheels turn freely, so the train is easy to push along a table or floor, hauling its load.",

The launcher requires four &#34;D&#34; (standard flashlight) batteries (batteries NOT included).<br /><br />The track in this set is the same track that is used in standard Hot Wheels gravity-car layouts.

    "title": "\"Pre-Assembled\" Statue of Liberty--Jigsaw Puzzle Pieces Construct Statue's Base",
    "text": "This RAVENSBURGER STATUE OF LIBERTY 3D PUZZLE (108-Piece) makes a nice souvenir of a visit to Liberty Island, but it's not a great 3D puzzle.  All of the flat plastic jigsaw puzzle pieces are used to construct the truncated-pyramid platform (a brown, brick-and-stone building in real life) that forms the base of the Statue of Liberty.  There are only two &quot;puzzle pieces&quot; for Lady Liberty--a molded green plastic statue with a golden torch, and a molded green crown that snaps onto the head of the statue.<br /><br />The plastic jigsaw pieces are nicely printed to look like the statue's base, but the brown tones and pictures of bricks are boring to assemble. The jigsaw pieces are numbered on the backs to give the correct order of construction.  You can assemble them by the numbers if you want a fairly easy puzzle (or if you're new to building 3D puzzles), or you can assemble them the traditional way by matching up the pictures on the fronts of the pieces.<br /><br />Some of the jigsaw pieces are hinged, to make the corners of the 4-sided base.  You just bend the pieces gently in the middle before using them to connect other pieces.  The statue snaps onto the platform, and the platform snaps (with little clips) onto a laminated cardboard piece that is printed to look like the plaza that surrounds the real statue.<br /><br />I'm a big, big fan of Ravensburger jigsaws, and I love the Ravensburger 3D-puzzle globes. But I was very disappointed with this puzzle, because the Statue of Liberty itself is &quot;pre-assembled&quot; (except for the crown).  Because the puzzle itself is of high quality, and produces a decent Statue of Liberty model, I rate this 3D puzzle at 3 stars (&quot;It's okay&quot; on the official Amazon scale).",

    "text": "This EUROGRAPHICS TREE OF LIFE BY GUSTAV KLIMT 1000-PIECE PUZZLE is a challenger even for jigsaw puzzle experts.  The design is full of repetitive elements (e.g., the tree-branch spirals, the gilt triangles).  The puzzle pieces fit together well, but they are NOT interlocking, and there are many, many weirdly shaped pieces.  Worst of all (or best of all if you love difficult jigsaws), the puzzle is cut on the diagonal, so you don't have the usual rows and columns to help you out with assembly by puzzle piece shapes and color areas.<br /><br />There are some clues to help with the assembly—the painting has colored triangles on the left, colored squares on the right--but you must constantly refer to the photo on the puzzle box to locate the recognizable elements on the pieces.  Success requires sorting of puzzle pieces, accurate placement of recognizable elements inside the puzzle frame before the background is filled in, and a generally highly organized approach to assembly.<br /><br />This puzzle is a terrible choice for a group project—not only because of the need to place elements in position before attacking the spirals in the background, but also because the non-interlocking pieces are easily jarred apart after recognizable elements are assembled.  The shapes are so weird, I even had a little bit of difficulty locating all of the edge pieces for the frame, to get the puzzle started.<br /><br />This puzzle is ONLY for the most dedicated, highly expert, jigsaw puzzle fans.  I doubt that children or most retirees will have the patience to stick with it to completion.  Because the puzzle is well made, but is difficult to the extent that it interferes with jigsaw puzzle enjoyment, I rate it at 3 stars (“It's okay” on the official Amazon scale).",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:5795137e2a23bd3d76a56d2b9446c889]] If you're already familiar with K'Nex building sets, this K'NEX THRILL RIDES-REVOLUTION FERRIS WHEEL is a simple, fast build.  The Ferris wheel is big, but it doesn't require a lot of pieces.  Also, much of the assembly involves building duplicate parts that combine to make the wheel and its swinging gondolas.<br /><br />The set is recommended for age 7+, and that sounds reasonable (assuming that an adult provides some initial help with making the connections, and assists with lifting the wheel onto the axle).  Each shape of piece is a different color, which detracts from the appearance of the finished Ferris wheel, but makes the construction simpler.  There aren't many “snowflake” connections, which I usually have to puzzle over to get the right orientation.  (K'Nex pieces are much harder to work with than LEGO pieces.)  The instructions are reasonably clear.  This set took me about 5 hours to build (from opening the box to completion, working at a leisurely pace).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the finished “thrill ride” isn't very thrilling.  Like a full-sized amusement park ride, the Ferris wheel doesn't do much—it just goes around and around in a circle.  Also, it does NOT have a variable speed control—you cannot start, stop, or speed up the wheel gradually (like a real ride).  Although the motor has a single speed, it does run in forward and reverse directions.  The motor is powered by two AA batteries (not included).<br /><br />For the Ferris wheel to turn properly, one edge of the inner wheel track must be settled into the groove on the “gear wheel” attached to the motor.  You can easily fiddle with the base to adjust things so that the track and groove always make good contact.  Because it's sort of boring and lacks a variable speed control, I rate this K'Nex Ferris Wheel kit at 4 stars (“I like it” on the official Amazon scale).",

It's motorized, and it performs really well.  It's fun to watch the chain pull the roller coaster car up to the top of the tower.  And of course it's fun to watch the car do the curves and loops of the track by gravity when it's released.<br /><br />It took me a couple of days, working off and on, to assemble this roller coaster.  The K'NEX pieces are fiddly to join, and the drawings in the instruction booklet are hard to interpret if you're new to the K'NEX system.  (The “snowflake” connectors are confusing; the rods must be inserted “just so”; and the drawings sometimes change their directional perspective without warning.)<br /><br />What I really loved about this set, is that the roller coaster car will often go around the loop more than once without any help.  Three continuous loops is fairly common.  Whether the car continues to loop by itself seems to depend on where the “chain-grabber” underneath the car hits the chain—whether it hits an opening in the chain or not.  If you're aiming for continuous loops, it helps to hold the base down.<br /><br />The K'NEX rods are thin, so the roller coaster support structure is kind of flimsy.  However, the connections are tight enough that you can pick the whole structure up and move it without destroying it.  A few connections may come loose, but they're easy to reconnect.  The roller coaster is a large structure (30” wide, 16” deep, 25” high), so you need quite a bit of space to build and play with it.<br /><br />The three experiments (one included in the box, two downloadable from the K'NEX web site) add to the educational value of this building set.  The first experiment suggests adding different amounts of weight to the car to test how added mass affects the car's ability to run the loops.  For the second and third experiments, you rebuild the coaster into a long gravity ramp, and then into a half pipe, to learn more about how a car behaves on a straight or U-shaped track.  Neither of these builds makes use of the motor, which is why the roller coaster build is far and away the best.<br /><br />When you open the box, keep the contents of each bag together, more or less.  You'll save time if you don't dump all of the pieces out in a big pile on the tabletop.  The pieces that are the same type are grouped together in the plastic bags—chain links, rods of certain lengths, red connectors, blue connectors, spacers, etc.<br /><br />When I'm assembling a big project like this one, with a lot of pieces, I use disposable plastic dinner and salad plates to hold the similar, or the same-colored, parts.  A nice thing about this K'NEX set is that each different type of connector is a different color (the orange connectors are different from the yellow connectors, and so on), so it's enough to check the color of the piece when you're following the instructions.",

    "text": "The great strength--and weakness--of this CREATIVITY FOR KIDS SPARK!LAB SMITHSONIAN &quot;INVENT A MOTORIZED ROBOT&quot; MODEL KIT is that there are NO step-by-step instructions for building even one simple model robot.  The idea of the kit is that a kid will figure out how to use the included parts to assemble a heavy paper robot of her/his own design.  The included booklet only gives general hints on how to use the parts.<br /><br />The illustrations on the box give further hints for assembling the parts into different-looking robots.  The parts include:  foam gears; plastic soda straws; bendable wire; gold metallic tape; glue; paper fasteners; punch-out, foldable, printed paper robot body parts; a motor wired to a pair of LED lights and a battery box; decorative stickers; and other items.<br /><br />The box shows a complete inventory of the parts, except that it doesn't make it clear that the boxy robot body parts are only made of lightweight paper, and that they arrive in flat sheets (although the punch-out body parts do have score lines to help with folding them into three-dimensional components).  For some reason, the batteries for powering the motor (two AA alkaline batteries) are NOT included.<br /><br />For the right child, this may be a fun toy.  It is relatively inexpensive (about $20 on Amazon) for a building toy.  However, I think that many children would be as baffled as I was by this building set.  How do you attach the gear wheels?  Do you use the plastic straws for axles?  If so, how do you attach the axles to the robot body so that they will turn?  Where should I place the motor?  What, if anything, will the motor power besides the big gear wheels?<br /><br />Many of the included parts are merely decorative, and struck me as being a waste of time.  I don't know whether the motor will power anything besides wheels (e.g., robot arms), but I do know that the motor's usefulness is severely limited by the very short length of wire between it and the battery box.  The two LED lights are attached to the battery box with short wires, too, so they always have to be placed close to the motor.  The lightweight paper components will not stand up to being taken apart and reassembled into different configurations--at least not very often.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think this kit will teach anything about robotics.  It will teach that gears attached to a motor will turn when the motor is turned on; and it will teach that you can rearrange decorative items to make robots that look different.  Because of its limited educational value and lack of instructions that make the assembly task fun all by itself, I rate this building toy at 2 stars (&quot;I don't like it&quot; on the official Amazon scale).",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:e0353531352173525aa3b993e4d37802]]This LIONEL MEGA TRACKS (CORKSCREW CHAOS GREEN ENGINE) playset was a big disappointment, even though I love model train layouts, Hot Wheels track sets, and LEGO building kits. What it is, is a car (like a train engine) that runs around a circular track that you can configure in different ways (assuming you have the extra parts for tracks, supports, and connectors).  Like a model train set, it takes up a large amount of floor space.<br /><br />The remote-controlled car charges in minutes, the car responds quickly to the pistol-grip remote, and the car doesn't jump the track easily.  (A charger for the car is included, but you will need to buy a 9-volt battery for the remote.)  However, the car only runs around and around the loop, so the real fun lies in building new and different track configurations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, building a new configuration is not easy, because the construction pieces are very hard to put together and take apart.  The square beam and clamp ends, and the gear-like round connector ends, take some force to insert in the joining spaces.  After they're inserted, they can only be removed by exerting more force as you rock them back and forth slowly out of the joining spaces.  In contrast, the track connectors are easy to attach (by snapping them shut), but you need a pry tool (a U.S. quarter or a flat screwdriver) to get those track connectors open again.<br /><br />I made a lot of mistakes during the first setup (which took me 1-1/2 hours).  I got a lot of practice at taking the parts apart, and my fingers hurt afterwards. (I'm really not looking forward to taking my set apart for storage.)<br /><br />The assembly instructions leave a LOT to be desired.  The tiny drawings don't clearly show the positioning of various connectors that can be inserted in more than one orientation, or the subtle differences between similar parts (e.g., the “B” and “C” track connectors).  There is also a mistake in one diagram, which labels a part “I” as a part “H”.<br /><br />Because the construction parts are so difficult to put together and take apart, and the playset is boring unless you can fool around with different track configurations, I rate this LIONEL MEGA TRACKS toy at 3 stars (“It's okay” on the official Amazon scale).  Note that you can buy this set with either a red engine or a green engine—if you buy one of each, you can build a larger layout and you can race or crash the cars, because the red and green remote controllers operate on different frequencies.",

It includes a snap-together plastic frame, plenty of colored embroidery floss for string, and reasonably clear instructions.  The box says it's for ages 8 and up, which seems about right.  (Adult help might be needed to assemble the frame, which requires the pegs to be properly oriented upwards or downwards for everything to snap together tightly.)<br /><br />There is some artistic creativity involved with this kit, as there are no stringing diagrams to follow.  Instead, the instructions say to knot your string to a peg in the frame, and then &#34;wrap the thread from a peg in one (upper) heart to a peg on the other side (the lower heart).&#34;  This is simple enough, but it's up to you to choose the pegs so that you get an eye-pleasing criss-crossing of the thread.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care for the color combinations:  bright blue small inside heart, purple edge for the large outside heart, yellow front of large outside heart, pink back of large outside heart.  When you're finished with all the stringing, you can set the big heart up on a little plastic stand.<br /><br />A small child might enjoy this project a lot.  However, being an adult, I was bored by the time I'd finished the small blue heart.  Because this kit persuaded me that I don't care for the string art craft, I rate it at 3 stars (&#34;It's okay&#34; on the official Amazon scale).  However, the budget price probably makes it a reasonable purchase if the intent is to keep a small child busy.",

    "title": "Great Action Figures, But Small Scale Makes Assembly More Difficult",
    "text": "This MEGA BLOKS CALL OF DUTY ANTI-AIRCRAFT VEHICLE has a lot of interesting detail, but it's quite a bit smaller than I expected.  The small size requires small blocks, and to stay in scale the soldiers' accessories (e.g., the hand grenade, the pockets, the belts) get really tiny.  Thus the assembly is more difficult than for other building toys with similar numbers of pieces.<br /><br />The camouflage coloring on most of the blocks also slowed my assembly down, because it makes the blocks harder to see and identify.  (But of course that's what camouflage is supposed to do, and you want camouflage in a military-themed building toy!)  The soldiers are indeed &#34;superposable&#34; action figures, per the claim on the box.  The figures bend at the knees and elbows; and the head, torso, arms and legs all attach with ball joints, so they can move in many directions.<br /><br />The instruction booklet (4-3/4&#34; x 8-1/8&#34;) is pretty good, though some of the pages have a few too many of the assembly steps combined.  It's easy to make mistakes when blocks are added on the top and the bottom of other blocks in a single step.<br /><br />Because I found the toy overly difficult to assemble on account of the small size, I rate it at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",

    "title": "Rebuilds Into Four Different Gravity-Defying Configurations; Uses Minimal Floor Space",
    "text": "This HOT WHEELS TRACK BUILDER SYSTEM STUNT KIT is one of the best &#34;stunt kits&#34; yet, because it can be set up in any of four (4) different gravity-defying configurations.  You build a basic &#34;stunt base&#34;, then choose the build that suits your numbered experience level:  High Jump (1), Criss Cross (2), Long Jump (3), or The Drop (4).  If you tire of one of the builds, you can easily take it apart and rebuild it into a different one.  (The stunt pictured on the box is the High Jump.)<br /><br />Because I'm experienced with the Track Builder System, I chose to build the Long Jump.  (I passed on The Drop for now, because it requires a tabletop as well as floor space for the setup.)  This is a high-performance stunt--you load a car into the rubber-band-powered launcher, hit the launcher release disk hard, and send the car up a ramp, around a loop-de-loop, over a wide gap to a ramp landing, and then down the track to exit the stunt into the rest of your Track Builder layout.  You can use the &#34;measuring stick&#34; to measure and lengthen the gap (the distance to the ramp),  once you master the launching technique needed to send the car through the entire stunt to a successful completion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this stunt kit is also one of the most difficult to build.  The Hot Wheels instructions are always a bit confusing--the drawings are three-dimensional, but they lack the dimensional accuracy of LEGO drawings.  The parts are shown in the instructions in their actual plastic colors, which helps, but the drawings don't always make it easy to identify the shapes of the parts or to see exactly how they go together.  However, the Building Instructions and parts for this kit have a feature I don't remember seeing before:  letters (A, B, C, etc.) molded into the parts, so you can match the letters (A to A; B to  B: etc.) to connect the parts.  This, too, helps with the building stage.  (Always remember that if you can't get the car to complete the stunt--no matter how hard you try--you probably made a mistake in the build.)<br /><br />The parts in the &#34;stunt base&#34; (see my first photo below) click together very tightly, and more or less permanently.  I was unable to pry the parts apart, even using workshop tools.  As a result, the assembled stunt kit cannot be taken completely apart for flat storage in the original box.<br /><br />This stunt kit comes with only one Hot Wheels car, and you will need at least one more car to fully play with it.  All four configurations have suggestions for using two cars (crashing at track crossings,  comparing speeds, etc.).  The kit has two (2) extremely powerful 4-speed launchers--I love these!  The launchers are the best I've ever seen.  (They are already set up when you take them out of the box--don't fool with the rubber bands.)  Another new wrinkle in this Stunt Kit is that you can use the retail box itself to add interest and difficulty to your larger Track Builder System layout.  There are printed ramps and &#34;fire pits&#34; that can be pushed up and locked together to make a platform with more obstacles for the cars.<br /><br />This is an excellent choice for any Track Builder System layout, because of its versatility, economical use of floor space, and low price (about $24 on Amazon).  The only drawback is that it's harder to build than most Hot Wheels stunts.",

    "text": "This  PEGBOARD SET WITH PATTERN CARD comes with lots of big, colorful, stackable pegs, but the foam base is something of a disaster.  Out of the box, the holes are too small for the pegs, so the instructions say to &#34;condition&#34; the base by inserting the pegs all the way through the holes and leaving them there overnight.  This does enlarge the holes in the foam base, but the holes still want to close up.  This makes the pegs difficult to insert into the base for play.<br /><br />I purchased this set for my husband to use for occupational therapy at home, in conjunction with a Saebo glove,  to help restore functionality to his stroke-damaged hand.  Unfortunately, the set is useless for this purpose, because of the effort it takes to insert the pegs (even if you have full use of both hands).  I think it would be equally difficult for a child to use this set, at least until the foam base becomes well-worn so that the peg holes will stop closing up.<br /><br />A couple of pegboard sets that do work for my husband's hand therapy are the [[ASIN:B0009K30YY Learning Resources Stacking Shapes Peg Board]], and the [[ASIN:B008E18S60 Hape Color and Shape Sorter]].

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:9dfca535e4cfc492b8a727bc7728e93b]] Of all my many Hot Wheels sets and stunts, this HOT WHEELS MONSTER JAM DRAGON BUILDUP set is my least favorite.  It's a one-trick show--you hit the launcher, and your big-wheeled truck is either &#34;chomped&#34; by the dragon, or the truck clears the dragon's mouth, dislodges the dragon's head (sometimes), and knocks the championship cup off the dragon's tail.  The outcome is strictly a matter of how hard you hit the launcher.  After about five minutes, I was tired of playing with this setup.<br /><br />Kids may like the three (3) big-wheeled trucks that come with this set.  For variations in play, the dragon element has two connectors for the launch ramp.  The first connector aims the truck at the dragon's mouth and tail; the second connector aims the truck at the dragon's tail.  Also, you can buy a second Dragon Buildup set, and connect the ramp from that set to your original dragon element, to be able to launch two big-wheeled trucks from different directions at the same time.  (I can't see this as being fun enough to justify purchasing a second set.)  Finally, the launcher will launch two standard Hot Wheels cars (not included), as well as one big-wheeled truck.  (It is kind of fun to launch two cars at once.)<br /><br />This set does NOT connect to other Hot Wheels layouts.  It's a standalone.  The set took me about 10 minutes to assemble, and about 15 minutes to add the stickers.  The stickers are worth the trouble, because they include the dragon's teeth, and two mean red dragon's eyes.  There is also a sticker for fans sitting on bleachers to watch the action.<br /><br />Because Hot Wheels Monster Jam Dragon Buildup is kind of boring and doesn't connect to other layouts, I rate it at 3 stars (&#34;It's okay&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",

    "title": "Not Fun, Not Educational--Another Bad Toy Marketed for Girls",
    "text": "[[VIDEOID:a7abc24222a8ac6ac6e109fd1d38813d]] This COOL BAKER CHOCOLATE TREATS MAKER is one of the worst toys marketed for girls that I've ever encountered.  One, it isn't fun (too many \"wait several minutes\" steps, and needs a lot of adult help).  Two, there is no suitable chocolate included in the box.  Three, it's extremely hard to create the candies as shown in the advertising (even though you're given the molds).  Four, it cannot be taken apart (for flat storage) once it has been assembled.  Five, it's hand-washable and even requires a brush for cleaning the crevices.<br /><br />MELTING CHOCOLATE.  Much to my surprise, this toy DOES melt chocolate with hot tap water alone.  (At least if your household has very hot tap water like mine does.)  You fill the pink warming tank (which has a separator that can be added for melting different chocolate colors at the same time) with hot water.  Then it takes 5-10 minutes, per the instructions, to melt the chocolate (even if you chop and stir with the spatula as you wait).  If you must actually heat the water for the tank, you must keep the water under a maximum 111 degrees Fahrenheit (well below boiling or simmering), because that is all that the plastic tank can handle.  The instructions warn that an adult should perform the task of filling the chocolate-warming tank.<br /><br />Different kinds of chocolate do take different amounts of time to melt.  My idea of using butterscotch chips, for the caramel color, turned out to be a bad one.  Butterscotch chips take much longer than milk chocolate chips or white-melting-chocolate disks, and the melted butterscotch isn't very workable even after it's melted.  I was unable to find any colored chocolate disks (as shown in the advertising) for melting, but maybe these are available online or in cooking specialty stores.<br /><br />CREATING TWO-COLOR CANDIES.  The 10-minute wait for melting isn't too bad.  While you're waiting, you can oil your candy molds.  If you want to create two-color chocolates, you must \"paint\" the details (owl eyes, gift package ribbon, central heart) into the molds with your first color, and then harden the details in the freezer for another 5 minutes.  Trying to paint in the details was a disaster for me!  Even though I read the instructions, I couldn't see what I needed to do to add the details and get well-defined owl eyes, or anything else.<br /><br />After you harden the details, you fill the molds with the rest of your chocolate, snap the molds shut, and wipe off any oozing chocolate.  You click each mold into the spinner thingy, and spin it for about 1 minute, before putting the mold into the freezer for a final 15 minutes to harden the candy.  I don't know what the spinning is for--maybe it helps eliminate air bubbles--but I do know that spinning isn't fun.  It's just boring.<br /><br />After 15 minutes of freezing, you can unmold your chocolates fairly easily.  They will probably have edges that need to be knocked off, because the chocolate oozes onto the flat parts of the mold when the mold is snapped shut.<br /><br />AMOUNT OF CHOCOLATE NEEDED.  An unpleasant surprise for me, was that a warming tray full of melted chocolate was NOT enough to fill all three candy molds.  It was only enough to fill 1 to 1-1/2 candy molds.  I had to melt chocolate in the largest section of the warming tank TWICE more to fill all three molds.  (And being an adult, I didn't spill or waste any melted chocolate to speak of.)<br /><br />GIFT TAGS AND BAGS.  The full toy kit includes a spinner thingy, three candy molds, three tools (a two-ended scoop, a \"paintbrush\" for details, a useful spatula), some small plastic gift bags, and a sheet of gift stickers.  The gift tags and bags are a nice idea, but you will have to practice with the molds if you want to create giftable candies.  The whole process is, of course, very inefficient, and practicing will require a lot of melting of chocolate and washing of molds.  It took me a couple of hours to go through everything for the first time.<br /><br />ASSEMBLY.  Probably the best thing about this toy is that it snaps together easily, and assembles into a solid \"spinner\" device.  However, the snap-together parts expand behind the openings they're pushed through (sort of like toggle bolts).  This means that the parts cannot be pulled apart again, for flat storage, once they've been connected.  (I couldn't pry them apart with a screwdriver.)  This is a space-hogging toy.<br /><br />CLEANING.  The parts of the toy are hand washable only.  Chocolate sticks in the crevices of the molds and the chocolate-warming tank, and doesn't come out with soaking, so that a dish brush is required for cleaning.<br /><br />SUMMATION.  This toy will allow a parent and child to create candies from melted chocolate, but there is little educational value.  Making candies this way bears no relationship to how candy is ordinarily made in the home kitchen.  Also, making candies this way isn't fun.  Most of the process involves waiting for chocolate to melt  or waiting for chocolate to harden in the freezer.  It's very difficult to fill the molds with the precision needed to create candies that resemble the ones shown on the box. Thus the finished candies are likely to be disappointing.  The finished candies taste like what they're made of--melted and hardened chocolate chips.<br /><br />Because this toy does actually melt chocolate chips or melting chocolate disks, and allow them to be molded into candies, as advertised, I rate it, rather generously, at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).",

    "text": "This MATCHBOX DINO TRAPPER TRAILER toy is great fun for me, as an adult.  I love the growling T-Rex sound effects, the glowing red eyes, and the whole operation of shooting a dart and then loading the sleeping dino onto the trailer.  It is quite easy to hit the T-Rex in the chest with a dart, to put him to sleep.  For the loading, you have to collar the T-Rex, attach him to the truck's winch, crank the winch to pull him onto the trailer, and then secure the load with a chain.<br /><br />A couple of reservations I have:  (1) I'm not sure how long this toy will sustain a child's interest; and (2) I think that attaching the rubbery collar and chain will require more strength and dexterity than a small child's hands are likely to possess.  However, the T-Rex is fun to activate and move around,  and the trapper's truck is a big, solid, detailed toy--a great truck for playing with by itself.  The darts are easily aimed, travel just far enough to be retrieved without effort, and have padded tips that are unlikely to do any damage to anyone who is hit by one.<br /><br />Getting the T-Rex and trapper's truck out of the box is a bit of a challenge.  There are posts that need to be rotated from the underside of the cardboard, a string to cut, some clamshell packaging (for the darts), and a rubber band around the truck's wheel that secures the winch.  A small child would definitely need help unpacking this toy.<br /><br />Note that this is a \"Matchbox\" toy, but not a matchbox-sized toy.  It is a very large toy.<br /><br />I genuinely love the Dino Trapper Trailer, and want to keep it for myself!  It will be given to a child, though--eventually.",

    "title": "Time-Consuming, Fiddly Build; Fun Except That Spiral-Lift Gears Disengage Easily",
    "text": "I love building toys, perpetual motion machines, and Rube Goldberg inventions, so of course I like this MARBLE MANIA ZOOMERANG BUILDING KIT.  It's not as much fun as it ought to be, though.<br /><br />First, it's quite fiddly to put together.  The black &#34;universal&#34; connectors must be oriented correctly (with holes outward) whenever they support ramp clips.  The purple tower pieces come in several sizes, and choosing a wrong size piece will create a tower that's the wrong height so that the ramps will slant incorrectly.  The clear tube surrounding the orange spiral lifter has a light gray connector at the bottom that must be placed &#34;just so&#34; or the marbles won't be able to enter the tube.<br /><br />Second, playing with the setup is constantly interrupted because cranking the spiral lift causes the gears to disconnect frequently.  I found that I could achieve fairly constant motion if I held the support piece for the lower gear (the green one) down with my hand against the black (gridded) base, but even then the gears would unexpectedly disengage--just when I was beginning to enjoy the perpetual motion rhythm.<br /><br />The &#34;Rube Goldberg&#34; aspect of the toy is a lot of fun.  The marbles climb to the top of the spiral, move quickly down the ramps, and circle around or drop straight through the blue funnel to begin their journey anew.  The spiral lifter will hold as many as eight marbles--the building kit comes with three marbles--and you can get more marbles going through if you can solve the problem of the disengaging gears.  The marbles occasionally jump the track, but not often.<br /><br />The assembly instructions aren't as clear as LEGO instructions, but they're not very hard to follow.  The black universal connections have a little red dot in front of them when they need to be oriented with the holes forward (see my customer photo).  The parts are reasonably well made.  One of my connector pieces was flawed, but it worked all right as a support piece (see my customer photo).  The $19.99 price seemed about right for this toy.<br /><br />This kit did in fact require a couple of hours for assembly.  Usually I can assemble a structure with the equivalent number of pieces much faster.  The black universal connector pieces in particular were uncomfortable to handle.<br /><br />I believe that this kit can be combined with other TechnoGears Marble Mania kits to create a more complex marble maze.  However, I wasn't interested in building onto this particular kit, because of the problem with the spiral crank and the disengaging gears.  I rate MARBLE MANIA ZOOMERANG at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:794a93ea445d6873412d11a47fb6c604]]This HOT WHEELS FAN MAN ACCESSORY is a fun addition to any Hot Wheels Track Builder set.  It adds color and motion, but not a lot of car-triggered action.  When a car  hits the lever that supposedly \"flattens\" the Fan Man, he pops right back up, because the trigger doesn't turn off the fan or the air flow that keeps him aloft.  (This is probably a good thing, because it means that the accessory doesn't need constant resetting.)<br /><br />The Fan Man accessory is easy to assemble.  It requires two alkaline C batteries (not included) to run the fan.  You use a Phillips screwdriver to open the battery case and insert the batteries.  Then you pop the fan blade onto the blue base. Then you click the red fan guard and Fan Man assembly onto the blue base.  Then you click the orange \"track holder\" onto the side of the blue base.  And you're done!<br /><br />The red switch turns the fan on and off.  You run a section of orange Track Builder track through the orange track holder (in any layout).  When a car comes down the track and hits the gray lever (from one direction only), the Fan Man is temporarily flattened.<br /><br />My Fan Man came with a crease under one arm (from the way it was packed) but the crease smoothed out some when I blotted it carefully with water.  It will probably iron out with low heat, but I'm not going to try this, because of the danger of melting the little guy.  The crease makes no difference whatever when the Fan Man is twisting and waving his arms while the fan is turned on.",

    "title": "Challenger Puzzle Tests Skills of Expert Jigsawer",
    "text": "[[VIDEOID:51e7617cadf31bd8d128cb7d9c7b5e17]]It's hard to believe that a mere 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle can be so difficult!  The RAVENSBURGER TITANIC PUZZLE is a genuine challenger--a puzzle that's interesting to assemble as a test of an expert jigsawer's skill, but one that's NOT fun to put together, because it's so very, very difficult.  Even the borders are difficult, and it's a temptation to quit altogether when the \"easy\" parts are completed, and only the top one-third with the dark blue, starry sky remains.<br /><br />The puzzle painting captures the very essence of the Titanic's last night, showing the doomed ocean liner steaming ahead at top speed on a clear, starry night--through a field of ice, toward the disaster that awaits her.  The dark blues of the sky, the stars in the Milky Way, and the reflections of the ship's lights on the water are so peaceful and beautiful!<br /><br />This puzzle would be a terrible choice for family entertainment, because the deep-blue sky pieces (in particular) are nearly impossible to distinguish by their colors or starry patterning.  The sky pieces must be laboriously assembled by closely examining the shapes (total number of tabs, large/small tab combinations, left/right offsets for tabs, etc.), and this is a task for a dedicated jigsawer working alone.<br /><br />Fortunately, it's not easy to make mistakes, because this is a high-quality Ravensburger puzzle with individual pieces that click softly into place.  This makes the assembly job a little bit easier.  (For an equally difficult jigsaw puzzle, one with pieces so similarly shaped that you CAN make mistakes, try the [[ASIN:B00B4RQU5C Tintin Rocket Puzzle]],  if you can find one.)",

    "title": "Cars Complete Their Runs Flawlessly; Versatile Design With Many Options for Addition to Existing Track Layout",
    "text": "This HOT WHEELS TRACK BUILDER SPIRAL STACK-UP set is a terrific choice for expanding an existing Hot Wheels track layout, as long as you have a fair amount of floor or table space.  It's a really large stunt that's about five feet long when it's assembled according to the boxed instructions (though the launcher ramps can be rearranged, using two towers instead of one, to use less space).<br /><br />The way this set works, is that the first car launched from the top of the tower launches two more cars (not included with the set) as it speeds down the ramp, then triggers a release that dumps a car off the second level of the &#34;box&#34; located at the end of the double ramp, until it finally exits the stunt through the lower level of the &#34;box&#34;.  The second car that is launched (by the first car) speeds down a long ramp that is connected near the top of the tower, and exits the stunt.  The third car that is launched travels down a short ramp and stops on the second level of the exit &#34;box&#34;, waiting to for the first car to dump it.<br /><br />There's a lot of action that makes me smile in this track builder set.  Also, the two cars that actually exit the setup have a lot of momentum left that will carry them elsewhere in a well-designed layout.  One of the best things about this setup is that all three cars usually complete the entire run flawlessly, without jumping the track or losing momentum or stopping too soon.  The &#34;Nitrium&#34; car that comes with the set is a fairly heavy one, because the set works best with a weighty car starting in the top position.<br /><br />For me, this Hot Wheels playset was a little more challenging to assemble than others that I've set up.  As always, the key thing is to identify your parts correctly, and to keep looking until you find the right place to make a connection if you don't understand the instructions right away.  The color-coding of the plastic parts helped me with one confusing part--the set has two red launcher arms that attach to a yellow base, and one gray launcher lever that attaches to a gray base.  In my customer photos, there are three cars loaded into the set--the orange/white car at the very top is the included Nitrium car.",

    "title": "New Favorite Hot Wheels Stunt Accessory",
    "text": "This HOT WHEELS SHIFTERS COLOR SPLASH SCIENCE LAB PLAYSET is my new favorite Hot Wheels Stunt accessory!  It's messy, because the car splashes water when it lands in a pool, but it's fun.  You load the tank at the top with ice water, and the pool at the end of the track with hot water, and the included Color-Shifter car will change color when it comes in contact with either the hot or the cold water (dark to light color, or vice versa).<br /><br />My Color-Shifter car needs to park underneath the cold waterfall (below the tank) or the cold spray (the pipe extending from the water tank) for a little while in order to change color, but there are moveable barriers that allow parking.  The Color-Shifter car changes color instantly when it lands in the hot pool.  At room temperature, the car retains its dark, light, or partially-shifted color (see my customer photos).<br /><br />A feature that I really like, is that when you launch one car, it triggers the release of a second car if you have placed a second car under the spray pipe, so that the two cars will exit the stunt playset simultaneously (at the bottom on the ramps at the left and the right).  You can adjust how the launched car will exit--you can set a ramp in the middle to either crash the car into the hot-water pool or allow the car to jump the pool and continue down the track to the exit.  Because the two exit ramps can be connected to other tracks, you can incorporate this messy water stunt playset into a larger Hot Wheels layout!<br /><br />The Color-Shifter cars apparently vary from playset to playset.  My playset came with a Nitro Doorslammer (dark green with cold water, light green with warm water).  Additional Color-Shifter cars (e.g., [[ASIN:B00IVP9UHA 24/SEVEN]]) are available from Amazon, but a regular Hot Wheels car that weighs about the same as the included car works fine.  The playset instructions caution that all Hot Wheels/Hot Wheels Color-Shifter cars may not work in every playset.  This playset's box has &#34;City&#34; printed on the front, so I would guess that all Color-Shifter cars in the &#34;City&#34; series will work with it.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained that the cars won't stay on the tracks, but I didn't have this problem.  The launcher has three tension settings, and my cars negotiated the tracks perfectly as long as I launched them with the first or second tension setting.  The track needs to be snapped together firmly for it to work.  The assembly instructions are easy to follow, although there are some tricky parts.",

    "text": "This MANHATTAN TOY STACK AND PULL TRAIN is irresistibly cute!  It's ready to play with, right out of the box--the three wooden train cars are already assembled, and the wooden stacking blocks are loose so you can immediately begin fitting them onto the poles that \"attach\" them to the cars.  The toy is well-made, all-wooden, and rolls smoothly across my living room carpet with the lightest of tugs on the woven pull cord.<br /><br />There are only a few ways to fit all of the stacking blocks squarely onto the train cars--the blocks with curved sides (that fit with the cylinder-shaped blocks) align with the diagonally cut blocks, but their plain sides don't sit flat on the cars.  I found myself looking at the picture on the box, to get all the blocks loaded onto the cars in the best possible arrangement--and had to laugh at myself!  No small child would be the least bit bothered by stacking his or her blocks in a way that leaves spaces between the blocks.<br /><br />I love the bright colors of these blocks, and the cheerful expressions of the farmer, the cow, and the pig.  The colors harmonize no matter how the blocks are arranged, and the painted triangles, dots, and curlicues add extra variety to the possible building-block combinations.  A detail that I particularly like, is the pair of yellow circles for headlights that appear on an edge of the green block that is used to represent the train or tractor engine.  This is an extremely well-thought-out toy.<br /><br />Also, this is a marvelously decorative toy.  I think it will look great on a shelf in a child's room, long after the child has outgrown playing with it. Best of all, it's a toy that makes me smile when I look at it.",

There are 1000 pieces, but the puzzle goes together fast, because of the many vertical lines (e.g., buildings, billboards), written advertising messages (e.g., Kodak, Marriott), and distinctive color areas (e.g., beer bottle, taxicabs,  window patterns).  It took me two days to complete.  (I'm admittedly rather obsessed once I get started on a jigsaw puzzle.)<br /><br />The \"augmented reality\" add-on is fun to play with.  You download the free \"AR Puzzle\" app (available only for iPhone 3GS, 4, 4S; or iPad 2, 3) from iTunes; start the app; select your puzzle; and choose \"360 degrees\" or \"facts\".  You then activate the augmented reality display by aiming your iPhone or iPad camera at the finished puzzle (or at the complete full-color puzzle photo that's packed in the box).<br /><br />If you choose \"360 degrees\", your device will display a view of Times Square.  The view changes as you turn yourself and your device around in a circle, so that the app seems to put you right there in the middle of the Times Square scene.  If you choose \"facts\", you can click on the \"i\" balloons as they come up over your puzzle, and get factoid displays.  (You must be patient and sweep over the puzzle photo to get the fact balloons).  My accompanying video slide show shows what you can expect from the augmented reality app on an iPad2.<br /><br />My only complaint about this puzzle is that the photos of Times Square don't seem to be very current, judging from the taxicabs and the things being advertised on the billboards.  However, it's a very satisfying puzzle to assemble, and the add-on feature is interesting and easy to use.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent playing with this.",

If you decide to try it, you won't need another jigsaw to work on for quite a while!<br /><br />With any 1500-piece jigsaw, you have to work by general color areas.  After rough sorting, I had the fewest pieces in deep orange, so I started with them.  Because they also had the cafe tables and people, I thought they'd go together quickly.  Wrong, wrong, wrong!  Progress was so slow, I didn't want to work on the puzzle at all (even though I love doing jigsaw puzzles).  It took me about 5 weeks--working on and off (mostly off)--to finish the orange part. Now I'm working on the cobblestones, and the puzzle is going faster--because I've got the hang of Van Gogh's painting style--but it's still going much more slowly than is usual for me.<br /><br />Aside from the difficulty, another problem with this puzzle is that it's very tall.  Because it's taller than my work table is wide, my original plan was to work the puzzle sideways on the work table.  I soon discovered that the puzzle is far too difficult to be assembled that way.  After a time, I turned the puzzle around so that it would be facing me straight on, and separated the top part of the puzzle border (the part that wouldn't fit on the table) to work it later as a separate puzzle section.  When both the main section and the top section are finished, I'll join them briefly for a photo session.<br /><br />CAFE TERRACE AT NIGHT is a puzzle that only an expert, addicted, jigsaw puzzler will enjoy--primarily for the challenge.  Like all Ravensburger puzzles, it is manufactured to very high standards.  The pieces are made of fairly thick cardboard, and they are perfectly cut, so that the pieces slip effortlessly into place when you have the right ones.  However, because the puzzle is almost too difficult to be fun, even as an extreme jigsaw challenge, I rate it at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).",

    "text": "This NEUSCHWANSTEIN CASTLE XXL puzzle is not for beginners, or for the faint of heart!  Any 2000-piece Ravensburger puzzle is difficult, simply because of the number of pieces, but this puzzle is probably above average in difficulty.<br /><br />The puzzle measures 52\" wide by 24\" high--it's a panoramic puzzle--so make sure you have cleared a wide space for it.  The XXL size means that the fine photo details are spread over more than one puzzle piece, and this increases the difficulty.  The puzzle is easiest to assemble if you stand over it as you go, so that you can see the bigger, overall picture.<br /><br />Ravensburger puzzles always have color areas to help you.  That's true of this puzzle, but the sky--there's lots of it!-- has less color variation than usual.  The border pieces are easy to find and assemble, but when you start on the remaining puzzle, it really dawns on you what a challenging task you have undertaken.  There are piles of dark blue, light blue, autumn-colored, and mostly-white pieces that look very much alike. For me, the hardest area was the lower left side, with all of the blue trees; and the big snow-covered tree at the right was far more difficult than I expected.  The castle was easy, and the autumn-colored trees were easier than you would think from looking at the box photo.<br /><br />Despite its difficulty, this puzzle was a pleasure to work.  The photo is just so beautiful!  Working at a comfortable pace (one to several hours at a stretch, but not every day), I needed about a month to finish this one.  As usual, I found the Ravensburger craftsmanship to be extraordinary--the pieces fit together so nicely that mistakes were few and far between.

The pieces slip into place easily if they're correct, and only rarely do two similarly colored pieces seem to fit.  With Ravensburger puzzles, my mistakes are minimal.<br /><br />I love to work difficult jigsaw puzzles, and assembling this LOFOTON, NORWAY puzzle was totally enjoyable.  The picture divides by color into several main areas (mountain, mountain range, dark sky, light sky, water, buildings, rocky outcropping, green trees), and none of the areas have a huge number of pieces.  If you take the time to sort the pieces, you can make quick work of this big, 1000-piece puzzle.  The hardest area is the green in the bottom right corner--that was a bit of a challenge, because the pieces are dark and have little or no photo detail!<br /><br />The \"augmented reality\" portion of this puzzle is fairly simple.  After you download the \"AR Puzzle\" app from the iTunes store (you may have to Google it to find it), you aim your iPad or iPhone at the finished puzzle and start the app.  By tapping the screen, you get white dots of \"snow\", and the scene changes to a winter scene.  If you tap too much, you get a nasty and disconcerting--but harmless--little surprise!<br /><br />This puzzle, although difficult, is much easier than the [[ASIN:B007ADICS2 Paris, 1000-Pieces Augmented Reality Puzzle]], which I found far less enjoyable because of the extreme difficulty of the photo.  However, the Paris puzzle has a much more elaborate and impressive Augmented Reality portion, which shows and describes the major landmarks of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower.  I really believe that jigsaw puzzles like these have educational value--doing jigsaw puzzles as a child helped me later with high school solid geometry and with art classes.",

    "title": "An Extremely Difficult Puzzle, Even for Jigsaw Puzzle Fanatics, Because of Puzzle Photo Problems",
    "text": "This Ravensburger \"Rooftops of Paris\" puzzle is probably the most difficult jigsaw puzzle that I've ever assembled.  The manufacturing quality of the puzzle is superb--every piece slips easily into place when it is the correct piece, but not otherwise.  But problems with the puzzle photo itself and the puzzle box photo increase the jigsaw's difficulty to the point where the puzzle is a chore--not a pleasure--to put together.<br /><br />First, the puzzle box photo:  you must work the left and right corner segments of the puzzle without ANY photo, because the puzzle box photo has descriptive graphics (a \"video-animation\" banner and a photo of an iPhone display) that completely cover large segments of the puzzle photo.  A tiny supplementary photo appears on the side of the box, but the puzzle photo's lower edge is cut off.<br /><br />Second, the puzzle photo:  the photo detail on most of the puzzle pieces is quite tiny, and in many areas, the photo itself is out of focus.  Consequently, to have any hope of finding the location of a piece, you must look very closely at both the piece and the puzzle box photo.  With the most out-of-focus pieces, you often cannot tell whether the piece is turned with the correct edge facing up.  I actually started with the nearly one-color sky, because it was the easiest part. (I like doing single-color puzzles from time to time, for practice with recognizing puzzle piece shapes and orientations.)<br /><br />After finishing the sky, I discovered that I could NOT assemble the remaining puzzle normally, by looking at the pieces, locating the ones that seemed to belong together, and assembling the pieces into various areas of the picture.  Instead, most of the photo detail is so tiny that the \"pictures\" on the pieces look like parts of an abstract impressionist painting, and even obscure the shapes of the pieces.  Worse yet, the pieces are often cut along color change points (for example, a mostly black piece may join with yellow tabs extending from a mostly yellow piece).  In the end, I sorted all of the pieces by general color AND camera focus, and worked the puzzle in horizontal and diagonal bands, using a magnifying glass at times to peer at the box photo and the pieces.<br /><br />The Augmented Reality feature is rather nice, although I had to Google \"AR Puzzle\" to find the free app in the iTunes store.  (The app works only with the iPad and iPhone; it does NOT work with the iPod Touch.)  To view the promised Paris nightscape, you must \"Start\" the app from the button on the menu screen.  This turns on the camera; then you activate the app by focusing the camera on the Eiffel Tower.  Thankfully, you can focus on the Eiffel Tower in the puzzle box photo as well as the Eiffel Tower in the assembled puzzle, so you don't have to finish the whole puzzle if you only want to see the AR app.<br /><br />Once you activate the app, you see a fisheye photo with the Eiffel Tower lit up.  Then you must move your iPad or iPhone to a vertical position to see the 360 degree nightscape that surrounds the central fisheye.  By spinning in a chair, or just turning yourself around in a circle (and holding your device facing you vertically), you see the night view of Paris from the top of the Eiffel Tower.  Circles identify major points of interest (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Louvre, Notre Dame de Paris).  When you touch one of the circles,  a page of historical, travel-guide-type description of the famous landmark comes up.<br /><br />Whenever I'm working on a jigsaw puzzle, I get rather obsessed with finishing it.  Assembling this puzzle (only 1000 pieces!) took me almost five full days--and I didn't enjoy the process, even though I normally love working the hardest  jigsaws.  In addition, the Augmented Reality feature is largely a gimmick that doesn't add much to the jigsaw experience. For these reasons, I rate this extremely well-made, extremely difficult puzzle at just 3 stars (\"It's okay\" on the Amazon scale).",

    "title": "Deliciously Difficult for Experienced Jigsaw Puzzlers",
    "text": "Even for jigsaw puzzle fanatics, this Ravensburger \"Vintage Vacations\" puzzle is deliciously difficult!  At first glance, it looks easy, because there are 10 different travel posters shown, and the poster scenes are separated by straight black lines.  However, the sheer number of pieces converts this \"easy\" puzzle into a challenging one.  It took me nearly 7 hours just to sort the 2000 pieces (by color) to my satisfaction.<br /><br />Bear in mind, this puzzle is HUGE.  The finished size is 29-1/2\" by 38-1/2\", which means you need a large work table or dining room table to assemble it comfortably.  Because I have limited space, I put it together on a work table that was just large enough to hold the finished puzzle.  Thus I had to work from trays of sorted puzzle pieces (disposable plastic dinner and salad plates will do), and this slowed me down.  It took me about 10 days, working half days, to complete the puzzle.<br /><br />To my mind, jigsaw puzzles are highly educational.  They teach shape and color recognition, and mental rotation of shapes.  With this particular puzzle, the assembly goes faster when you pick up its logic:  one travel photo has bathers in a pool, another has bathers on a beach; one photo has motor tours, another has a power boat race; two photos show city tourist spots; and so on.<br /><br />The Ravensburger puzzle is high quality, as advertised.  Each piece is unique as to color and shape, and the pieces are totally interlocking--no pieces have those annoying curved edges that just slide up against each other.  The detail of the tiny people is amazing.  Also, the puzzle has airplanes, boats, clouds, and different colors that break up the larger areas of sky and water, so that the puzzle never seems impossible or boring.",

I see some reviewers commenting on the choice of items for each letter, and while some feel a little odd/non-traditional, I don't see it as a big issue. Two reasons I deducted a star for this rating: (1) the acorn tops do not stay on when these are placed in a bag - and how else do you expect to store or transport these? Every time we try to put these away, it just become a salad of toys, acorns, and tops.

I can only imagine these will be either dropped to the bottom of the toy bin, or else maybe put on a shelf by a collector. In either case, not much use as a toy.",

First of all, I'm not sure the ramp is really all that much &#34;easier&#34; for little hands to put the toys in/out of the bus. But as long as it's there, I wish they would have included a child with a wheelchair. The toy figures are quite diverse - I would have loved to see that go a step further. But the design flaw is really what has me scratching my head. The seats on the bus are recessed, but are too large for the little figures to actually fit into. Once you start moving the bus, the figures fall and scatter. I'm not sure Battat understood how totally frustrating that is for little kids - especially since they don't just keep these rolling along quietly, slowly on the floor, but tend to take toy vehicles &#34;off road&#34; and even flying up into outer space. I _really_ wish these little figure snapped into the seats and stayed put.",

Instead, our son has watched some videos and also come up with ways to use the materials here in his own way. This is a nice set to introduce a child to magic, but is probably not as comprehensive or well-crafted as an older child might want if they get serious about doing polished tricks.",

I do wish all four balls went down the track - the little &#34;door&#34; that opens on the far left chute is tricky for small hands to open & close, and there's not much to be excited about when the ball goes straight down.

It took me far too long to put together, but I was impressed by the finished product.<br /><br />First of all - this is big! Look carefully at the specs on this toy to see if it will fit well (or dominate) your play space. The colors and designs are bright and cheerful, which I like. There are a few specific mechanical steps to make this work right with the car, and I worried that it would be too complicated for my 2yo granddaughter. (1) The arm needs to be clicked down into position, (2) you need to wind the car up the ramp (and the crank for that is tricky - if you let go just a little, it slides back to the bottom), then once the car slides down the ramp into the cradle you need to (3) release the arm for the catapult to launch down the second slide. Again - sounds complicated, right? But my granddaughter mastered it in no time! I was surprised and happy about that.<br /><br />I was also very happy that she played with this over and over. She never seemed to get bored with it. The little car plays music and phrases as it goes along, and even when all the steps didn't go perfectly (ie: the car crashed), my granddaughter was amused. One quick note: some of the joints seem to come apart easily, and since toddlers are a little rough, we needed to keep an eye on this. Still, this will be a great toy that grows with our grandkids!",

I'm wondering if K'NEX has made some improvements in the meantime, because my husband and son said this set was *much* more enjoyable! The parts were sturdier, fit together better, and the instructions were much clearer. It still gave them an afternoon of dedicated father/son time to build it, and they were SO happy with the result! This is a super exciting coaster, made even better by the fact that it can run vertical or horizontal. AND...it glows in the dark! My 9yo and husband are thrilled with themselves, and aside from trying to find space for this 2.5' colossus, I'm happy too. Major win from K'NEX.",

There are a ton of pieces, and though it comes in a container, they are hard to fit in there after you start playing with them. I'm not sure why, but after just a few times playing with them, this set is now gathering dust on the bookshelf. My son has just not been that interested. They are a bit larger and almost more clunky than LEGOs, and I think the bright coloring almost makes it skew a little more juvenile.<br />These would probably be a big hit with another kid, but my son just wasn't very interested.",

The colors on the handles are bright and consistent. The ruler feature on the blade is interesting, but I'm not sure if it's particularly useful for the target age group. And I didn't quite understand the spot where you can customize each pair of scissors with a name - trying to remove the tiny cover and insert a tiny slip of paper with a name took more time than it was worth. Far simpler to just write a child's name with a Sharpie on the blade itself. Overall, though, these are quality scissors and offer up a ton of potential for projects with young children!",

Though we built it on the floor, he asked to have it raised up, so now it is taking up our entire dining table. Make sure you have room for this train set! Also, be careful in unpacking that you don't lose/throw away the directions. They are on a flimsy piece of paper that is easy to miss, and without it, it's difficult to figure these tracks out - they only fit in one configuration. At this point, I am considering marking the tracks in some manner to indicate how they attach, just so I don't have to fish out the directions each time my son wants to move the set. The set works with other tracks, and I can see how this could easily expand into a whole train world. This is a nice, solid, well-made train set!",

The idea is similar to other games out there - (first thing I think of is Scattergories) - where you have to quickly think of words that start with a specific letter for a particular category. In this case, the category might be &#34;pizza toppings,&#34; and then you call out an item, tapping down the letter it starts with, and hand it off to another person who has to call out another item starting with another (non-tapped) letter, etc etc, until the timer buzzes. The concept is generally ok. But there are better versions of this type of game out there. More creative, I guess. And I honestly do NOT like the design of the Tapple board that gets handed around. It's nearly impossible to quickly pass it off without accidentally tapping down one of the letters in the process. Big design flaw. We *have* found an unexpected use for this game - it's been a fun way to help my 6yo expand his vocabulary. We don't play the game, per se, but do use it without the timer and have him think up different words within each category. But for a group game? I'll pass.",

I did find my older kids a little more adept at maneuvering the pieces, etc, and it was a bit more fun to play with them.

The circular part on the top is not very satisfying to slide back and forth, and the piece itself can easily come off. In fact, all 3 pieces come apart pretty easily.<br /><br />The toy feels sturdy and has a nice weight to it, but the magnets feel kind of weak, especially the top and middle magnets. Skip this one.",

I've had it for a few weeks now and it is holding up great. My main issue is that the \"metal\" material they use feels pretty light. I'd guess it's aluminum and not stainless steel (which is what I assumed when I saw the model name was \"AB-SS\".

In the beginning, it was spinning really smoothly and would spin for a long time, but now it has begun falling apart. The big piece in the middle (which spins), becomes unhinged from the top and bottom corners, which removes the smooth spinning (see pic). So you have to click it back in place, which becomes pretty annoying, especially given how recently I got this. Also, this thing is a fingerprint magnet. Overall, I'd pass on this.",

If it becomes too lose, the cards begin separating, which is annoying. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but it loosens within a few minutes, so it's just annoying to have to constantly be re-tightening it. Secondly, I'm not a huge fan of the metallic sound it makes when you slide the cards open/closed. This is definitely personal preference, but I would have preferred a more muted sound. Lastly, because it's heavy, when I drop it, I get nervous that it's going to leave a dent in my wood desk (it hasn't).<br /><br />Despite my gripes, it is pretty satisfying to play with.

Some other review mentioned a laser light, but mine came with a plastic spinner instead.<br /><br />I have several gripes about this thing. Both things, really.<br /><br />First off, the size. The metal one is a little large to reliably spin with one hand. The plastic one is actually much easier to use with one hand. Although I don't love the design. I wish it had points sticking out instead of the rounded edges.<br /><br />Secondly, because the metal one has a spinner at each point, it's hard to get leverage for the spin because the smaller spinners will spin instead. This is more of a problem if you are trying to hold and spin with the same hand.<br /><br />That said, it feels very solid and well made.

    "text": "This is a great BPA-free food grade sensory toy for toddlers. It is rated for toddlers 18 months+. It looks like a spaceship with tentacles. The tentacles are silicone and can be pulled through the \"spaceship.\" There are three fidget circles on one side of the perimeter. On the other side, there is one button that, when pressed, moves from hole to hole.<br /><br />I really like this but it is important to supervise the child when using this. Also, be careful because it can be thrown easily by grabbing onto the tentacles.<br /><br />The current price of $9.09 ($13.99 minus 35%) is a steal as most are around $14. I gave one of these to my neighbor's son and he absolutely loves it.",

It is rated for toddlers 12-18 months or older but my neighbor's toddler is 6 months and plays with one like this; under supervision. This one looks like an airplane with tentacles. The tentacles are silicone and can be pulled through the body of the \"aircraft.\" There are some others like this that have fidget circles and buttons but this one does not. It is a basic unit.<br /><br />I really like this but it is important to supervise the child when using this. Also, be careful because it can be thrown easily by grabbing onto the tentacles.<br /><br />The current price of $8.99 ($10.99 minus $2) is reasonable for this. For those interested in units with buttons but a little more expensive, then take a look at this [[ASIN:B0B62KX3F9 one]].",

I think this is a standard label they slap on everything.",

    "text": "This is a purple baby rattle/teether dumbbell. It is so cute. It bends and the ends are the rattle.  This has to be sterilized before first use either in boiling water for 2 minutes or in the top rack of the dishwasher. It is rated for babies 6 months and above but I suggest supervising during use. It is BPA free and free of phthalates, lead, and cadmium per the box.<br /><br />This is made of 100% food-grade silicone and is made in China.<br /><br />Overall, this is a cute teether and rattle. It is also great for cute baby pictures posing with this dumbbell. The current price of ($8.99 minus 10%) is reasonable for this as a previous one I ordered from another vendor was several dollars more.<br /><br />NOTE - Always supervise a baby when using this because if the child throws this, it could hurt another child.",
