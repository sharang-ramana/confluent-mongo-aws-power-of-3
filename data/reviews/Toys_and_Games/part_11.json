He is though small like 1/8 scale general figure size he is not big he's about 15cm tall but he's cape and sword makes him look big and outstanding.. Of course I preordered him since march 19 so i was looking forward to this day, i was pretty impressed with his details a tiny bit disappointed about his size but i got over that once i saw how very well made he is.",

The elevator isn't very smooth to adjust, you kind of have to force it. It took several hours to assemble this thing. Be prepared to set aside 6 hours because this is definitely a mansion.

Maybe fun for a caterpillar or fireflies or something, and it's so so important for kids to have dirty experiences with the natural world... but parents please don't let these be little starvation cages or let your kid toss them around with creatures in them. That's a terrible lesson to learn more than once.<br /><br />The quality is meh, but excellent for the price. They seem sturdy enough but the seams are a little sloppy. That's just aesthetic though, they seem up to the task of caging bugs or carrying mushrooms. And 4 for $14?? Can't beat that price! I'm a happy camper.",

It doesn't matter if your crawling a 5500lb ,4 door Jeep on 40s or a 1/10 scale , wide-bodied crawling truggy on 4.75\" tires ; the actual rubber tires in both scenarios are going to claim approximately 75%-80% of the effort. The other 20% is made of small , individual skills or options ( line choice, weight distribution, wheelspeed, conditions, driver aptitude, et.al) but I'm just saying this activity is nearly ALL ABOUT THE TIRES.<br /><br />This is fourth set of tires I've bought for a Vaterra Ascender WB2 K10 from '72. Each have been deficient in some manner but then I sprung for the ones w/ such a reputation . I was not just equally impressed, I was floored . I have bought so many tires over the years. I know 35\" -42\" bias or radial carcass design, tread behavior, terrain/conditions affects, durability to durometer, on & on. Well,  let me just say that these 1/10 scale PItBulls are every bit the same product my pals that run them on real , full size crawler rigs & Jeeps. Even gusset reenforced sidewalls inside !<br />The 'Alien Snot' compound is otherworldly adhesive when you scrub them down w/ simple green before mounting. You will find they stick to your fingers once rid of the mold residue.<br />If the RC could escape gravities pull, it would literally climb walls with these tires.<br /><br />Now that you've tried the others , coughup the small added $ for a set of these. There a reason so many RC guys run them .",

Same physics ,same weight & balance considerations, everything. That being said, the closest vehicle choice which comes very close to the exact behavior of a Jeep JKU on 37-40\" tires & beefedup , straight axle housings sprung w coilovers is the Vaterra Ascender.

These raised fasteners also meant you could only hang paper in the very middle of the painting area, because they stick out so far.

Just have to keep track of the math in any form you feel comfortable, and it is an otherwise easy game to play. As a group, everyone works to keep the discard pile under 99. As an individual, you are out of the game if your play makes the pile 99 or over. Then the remainder of players keep going until one player is left. There are some fun changes like reverse card, draw 2 card, a subtraction card, and the dreaded 99 card (has a couple of rules on how to play it, when not to).<br /><br />Inexpensive pack of cards. You may like it or may not. My 5 stars is because it has all the cards, game instructions are easy to understand, and it doesnt feel stressful to learn or play. I find it a worthwhile addition to the game shelf. I dont really play card games, but Ive always taken to the Uno brand games.",

I can see grabbing it as an add on to a themed gift, or simply to have it on hand for yourself whenever the mood to doodle strikes.

Take a look at the product pictures to see the difference between the two. Choose wisely.<br /><br />The mixed color variety is just as pictured. 8 different designs. A roll of 500 total. One has the phrase \"thank you\" printed on it, which I really like as an option because I often give out little token gifts or notes, and the addition of \"thank you\" is totally appropriate. The others are simply different patterns in heart shapes. Certainly not limited to Valentines Day. All the others look appropriate to use any time. Nice way to close off a goody bag (candy, baked goods, etc) or a card. The size of the stickers is a little over 3\" x 3\" so they are a good size!<br /><br /> If you want a more Valentines look, then choose the other \"shinny\" set, which appears to be just shiny red stickers.<br /><br />Quality is fine.. it's a sticker. I am not making unnecessary trips going into stores looking for heart stickers, so the convenience of online shopping makes it worth it to me. I think an option that includes both sets would be nice to see and add greater value.",

I would normally not bother with a review, but I thought it looked promising enough that it was worth recommending (even sight unseen, but I at least has opportunity to really look at it eventually, just not play it through). I bought it as a christmas gift for a couple of young boys- ages 10-14ish. Not entirely sure. When I am selecting gifts I always buy games or books for kids, always looking for educational offerings.. and given the theme of this and how it is designed for education in mind.. I thought this one seemed right up their ally. I had read reviews, looked over the details of the game, and while it cost a little more than I would normally spend on a token gift for kids I don't know real well, I thought it was interesting enough sounding to me- and educationally interesting that it would be worth a bit of a splurge (hoping they liked it and benefited from it!). Math, imagination, intrigue, magic, economics, strategy, skill development.. all UNPLUGGED- no need for apps, electronics. Can play under kitchen table light, or by candlelight. *I* thought it sounded fun. I may have to pick up another game for my own use at home.<br /><br />I also liked the look of the box and the components. The colorful thick cards, bright potions in bottles on a rack, thick play currency.. It just didn't/doesn't look cheap. I was able to look over the materials, and it is a solid looking game. I just didn't have chance to actually play it. I really hope they liked it,and that the parents appreciated it. It seems like a game to hold on to, take care of and use time and time again.<br /><br />It is because I am considering purchasing again for future gift giving, and have recommended other people to check it out, and that I keep it book marked to come back to, that I am going ahead with a full 5 star rating. It looks good, has quality look and feel, has game play with both education and imagination in mind. Instructions are straightforward- not too awkward or frustrating. The marketplace reminds me of any of the online game play (especially mmos) but all without the need to be attached to electronics.",

I don't know if it is complicated or not, but it looked appealing and out of all the other games on here I looked at, I chose this one. I think with games you have to be one to want to learn and play them (I don't) and/or know who you will be playing with- are they patient, receptive to learning, etc.<br /><br /> I bought it as part of a gift for a family with 4 kids of various ages. I bought a few games and this was one of them. I didn't want to spend more than $10 per game, and this fit the bill. Seeing the topical use of \"trash pands\" and \"doggo\" make me laugh, so I thought the older kids would like it too. Who knows how relevant it will be in a few years. I do not know if they ever played it or if it is collecting dust somewhere. I thought a couple of the older ones would like the name of the game. I am not into buying toys for kids, usually it is books, games, or project/activities. They seemed to be curious about it and had mentioned that they were getting into playing games like this, so hopefully they have enjoyed it.<br /><br />I give it a 4 for simply being intriguing looking, sounding fun, well packaged, attractive, current, and seemingly quality game.

They are large enough to provide good view of what needs to be done. The challenge level is considered the \"extreme range\" and best suited for \"gifted or experienced problem solvers\". I don't necessarily consider myself either, but I found some were doable, and a couple were frustrating. Either way, I think these are worth the time whether  you figure it out or not. I sometimes find that  I can solve one, then return to it some time after and have pretty much forgotten how to do it.

It was better when it dried well but this is a very fragile project. However, my granddaughter had fun watching the tree grow as the day continued.

I'm giving to girls ranging from age 6 to 11.  My six year old was literally enthralled for hours on end as she reviewed the endless combinations of colors, patterns and accessories for the outfits.  She's more if a science kid, so I wasn't sure it would interest her.  Her favorite gift this year was a mineral and rock collection.  When we were decided which family member would get what, she asked if she could have one.<br /><br />This would make an excellent party activity for a girls and the kids could take the portfolios home or leave a signed page with the birthday girl.<br /><br />I'm not much of a trendy fashion girl myself and I abhor anything Barbie-esque for the most part.  But I loved the ethnic diversity.  Just wish more body types were represented that reflect what women truly look like.<br /><br />Overall, as a stimulating artistic exercise, I'm very pleased with this purchase.",

Only downside is the pieces get mixed easily and the stamps they put on back of the pieces isn't very dark so it's a little hard for a 3 yr old to differentiate between them. But the puzzle is of great quality and can withstand throwing,chewing and whatever else a toddler can put it through... Bout for Christmas and we are still playing with them. Great buy!!",

    "text": "My wife bought me this for Christmas, and I actually really like the way it flies. It drifts quite a bit and I try to adjust it with the trim settings but can't seem to get it to stand still even in low wind. It is still a lot of fun though and fairly simple to control. The problem with this drone, is the camera! I just don't know what they were thinking. The MicroSD card recording seems like the logical way to go, for two reasons. First, the WiFi signal is weak. So sending video from the drone to your phone using a weak WiFi signal is going to make the video pause when it gets too far from your phone. Second, having the phone mounted on the controller seems to cause interference which also makes the video pause during recording. So when you play the videos back, the timer is counting like it's playing, but the video appears frozen and then skips portions of the video. Epic fail! So I decided to buy a 16gb MicroSD and try my luck with that and ignore the FPV part entirely. Good luck! The video files require VLC because QuickTime won't play them. Some don't seem to record at all. Just overall, not happy with the video part. It's fun to fly and I don't expect much in this price range, but did they even try them before mass producing them? What fun is a drone with a crap camera?",

I'm not cheap, but if I can save money by doing something myself, I'm going to.<br /><br />The lumber, all pressure treated, was about $450. We bought this set, a saucer swing (and lumber/supplies) for the other side, a small rock walk kit. We built another A frame in the same dimensions as the one the kit instructions said to make for the saucer swing, I also bought an extra support bracket for the end.<br /><br />We added solar lights recently too. Total cost, including all the extras, was just about $800. We had everything cut and stained prior to having two friends over to help assemble. It took three adults just about 4 hours to put it together, start to finish, sigh varying levels of skill. My 6 year old and 4 year old love it! Very blessed to have gotten this for them for Christmas right before this pandemic!<br /><br />Saucer Swing: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07QYY4WR4?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title<br /><br />A Frame Support Bracket: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B005KUL00O?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title<br /><br />Rock Wall Kit: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01H5VFI8U?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title",

The only con is that the black residue rubbed away can add up if multiple pages are used at once (which should be expected). The residue was an easy clean up with no black streaks on the table. We've got a long way to go but I would buy again.",

I also thought it would be a good tool to trace letters so they can improve their handwriting. Today, I used these with one of the children. My ideas are going to prove fruitful.<br /><br />I have a few issues that may or may not be of importance to others: The letters are tough for little uncoordinated hands to extract from the box but fine putting them back in (for the most part). The inkpads seem to only have a sheer pigment. I'll have to get different inkpads so that the letter will show up with the 1st stamp. I had to press hard and drag the stamp to get the ink on there solidly. Maybe a little OCD, but the letters are not all centered on the stamp so the letters may create a wave or have too much space between them if stamping out a word or sentence for the academic stuff I want to do with this kit. It'll be fine for creative art activities though. I'll add a photo later.",

After our twins learned the alphabet in order, we then began asking them to name letters by their color. We practiced simple skills like &#34;put on red letters&#34; or &#34;take off blue letters.&#34; We also ask them to name the letters by the column or reading them backwards from z to a. You can help your child say simple sentences like, &#34;the letter z is orange&#34; or &#34;help me find the letter w.&#34;<br /><br />A few of the letters are tough (for the little ones) to fit in. ...the S is an example... However, it just presented us with an opportunity to share directions like &#34;flip, turn or spin&#34; the letter around.<br /><br />We have had these over 2 years and the color is still strong and there have been no cracks or splintering of the wood letters or backboard. The individual letters are sturdy. This is a great tool for children with autism or various learning disabilities.",

The four year olds still play with them. I highly recommend stackable for all growing minds and especially autistic children for project base learning.<br /><br />The cups do have holes vented in the bottom so if you have a child who likes to transfer items from one cup to another, stay close. 1 of ours is fond of pouring juice in them to drink AND plays in the mess when I turn my back. 😉😐😂",

But that's because I was tugging on it so if I had to say if you play with it normal and don't yank on it it'll be fine because my other one I bought (I bought 2 at once) didn't break. It's work they money Not overpriced and it's worth it. It's really gif table because o gave one to my 6 year old brother and he loved it. I do recommend but it does makes a lot of noise.",

Maybe it fits an American boy doll better, I don't know. Last picture is me pulling his helmet down wishing it would stay that way but it won't.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:545a32dca90c47010c7188d45c945621]] Hotep friends. Some of the pros about this display case are it's crystal clear and you can take out the two-tiered stand that's inside. If you don't like the clear handle on the front, you could turn the display to the back. Some of the cons are the top is not clear it's white so you can't see through it from the top or the bottom just the front back and sides. It assembles very easily, and it comes with a pair of gloves to help you not put fingerprints on the acrylic. The only difficulty I find with this Stand is removing the protective film on the acrylic. But it's nice to have that protective film so you don't scratch the acrylic during shipping or unpacking. I highly recommend my friend. Thank you for looking at my review. I hope it was beneficial for you if it was, I would appreciate it if you would click the helpful box below, thank you. God bless you.

My grandson just turned 21 and I shared these financial literacy flash cards with him. I wanted to see what he knew about financial literacy and what we can work on together. One thing I like about these financial literacy flash cards are there in 3 different stages. Easy, medium, and not so easy to understand. It's great when you can teach your child financial literacy, when he or she has a clean slate. In these modern times there's so many scams both legal and illegal that we all must be aware of financial literacy. In some cases, with financial and biblical literacy, you can see right through a scam or something that might get you into trouble down the road. If I could, I would teach everybody, man, woman, and child about financial literacy to help them now and in the future. But you must start somewhere if you really care before your children gets out there. I highly recommend my friend because with the need for financial literacy there is no end.

Totally non-toxic, environmentally friendly and safe.<br />Although this is a kids set it also could be a nice starter set you bet. The little tray and the tools you can reuse to do more art whenever you choose. I recommend using better paper which you can get anywhere when you're on your art caper. Be sure that when you mix it you mix it right and it's best to let your mixture stand overnight. Now here's a secret that the box doesn't tell and that's how you could mix your own solution very well. There are several methods for making marbled papers. A shallow tray is filled with water, and various kinds of ink or paint colors are carefully applied to the surface with an ink brush. Various additives or surfactant chemicals are used to help float the colors. A drop of \"negative\" color made of plain water with the addition of surfactant is used to drive the drop of color into a ring. The process is repeated until the surface of the water is covered with concentric rings. The floating colors are then carefully manipulated either by blowing on them directly or through a straw, fanning the colors, or carefully using a human hair to stir the colors. In the 19th century, the Kyoto-based Japanese suminagashi master Tokutaro Yagi developed an alternative method that employed a split piece of bamboo to gently stir the colors, resulting in concentric spiral designs. A sheet of washi paper is then carefully laid onto the water surface to capture the floating design. The paper, which is often made of kozo (paper mulberry), must be unsized and strong enough to withstand being immersed in water without tearing.<br />Another method of marbling more familiar to Europeans and Americans is made on the surface of a viscous mucilage, known as size or sizing in English. While this method is often referred to as \"Turkish marbling\" in English and called ebru in modern Turkish, ethnic Turkic peoples were not the only practitioners of the art, as Persian, Tajiks, and people of Indian origin also made these papers. The use of the term Turkish by Europeans is most likely due to both the fact that many first encountered the art in Istanbul, as well as essentialist references to all Muslims as Turks, much as Europeans were referred to as Firengi in Turkish and Persian, which literally means Frankish.<br />Historic forms of marbling used both organic and inorganic pigments mixed with water for colors, and sizes were traditionally made from gum tragacanth (Astragalus spp.), gum karaya, guar gum, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), fleabane, linseed, and psyllium. Since the late 19th century, a boiled extract of the carrageenan-rich alga known as Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), has been employed for sizing. Today, many marblers use powdered carrageenan extracted from various seaweeds. Another plant-derived mucilage is made from sodium alginate. In recent years, a synthetic size made from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, a common ingredient in instant wallpaper paste, is often used as a size for floating acrylic and oil paints.<br />In the size-based method, colors made from pigments are mixed with a surfactant such as ox gall. Sometimes, oil or turpentine may be added to a color, to achieve special effects. The colors are then spattered or dropped onto the size, one color after another until there is a dense pattern of several colors. Straw from the broom corn was used to make a kind of whisk for sprinkling the paint, or horsehair to create a kind of drop-brush. Each successive layer of pigment spreads slightly less than the last, and the colors may require additional surfactant to float and uniformly expand. Once the colors are laid down, various tools and implements such as rakes, combs, and styluses are often used in a series of movements to create more intricate designs.<br />Paper or cloth is often mordanted beforehand with aluminium sulfate (alum) and gently laid onto the floating colors (although methods such as Turkish ebru and Japanese suminagashi do not require mordanting). The colors are thereby transferred and adhered to the surface of the paper or material. The paper or material is then carefully lifted off the size and hung up to dry. Some marblers gently drag the paper over a rod to draw off the excess size. If necessary, excess bleeding colors and sizing can be rinsed off, and then the paper or fabric is allowed to dry. After the print is made, any color residues remaining on the size are carefully skimmed off of the surface, in order to clear it before starting a new pattern.<br />Contemporary marblers employ a variety of modern materials, some in place of or in combination with the more traditional ones. A wide variety of colors are used today in place of the historic pigment colors. Plastic broom straw can be used instead of broom corn, as well as bamboo sticks, plastic pipettes, and eye droppers to drop the colors on the surface of the size. Ox gall is still commonly used as a surfactant for watercolors and gouache, but synthetic surfactants are used in conjunction with acrylic, PVA, and oil-based paints.<br /><br />I recommend my friend.

So, with this set when I tried to get some black highlights to just give a kind of shadowing effect. I could not hardly get any black paint out of the marker. All the directions say is to put the marker firmly into the pen. After that you are on your own. Maybe I should learn how to refill my own black markers. I know some here will call me a hater. I am paid for my opinion now and later. But I recommend it, IT is fun, it gives a look that we used to call professionally stippling. I think they still call it that.

In fact if you put your arm in the back you can put your hand in her head to move her mouth to say and do just about anything you want. She comes with a rod that you can put on either hand to move and make gestures. Another thing I like about this super chick superhero is she has a removable Cape that if left on it can hide your arm, so that your audience does not get alarmed.  OZ",

As is, it seems pretty fast. But I don't think this will be much of a problem. You can always turn it off if you want to add little details to the egg.

Can't find anything on YT either. The closest thing we found was something called the pindaloo. So if you need some help, search \"pindaloo juggling\" since it's based on the same principe. The only difference is the pindaloo is fully enclosed, so I think it's a little easier to learn, since the ball can't escape the loop. With this \"Scoop de loop,\" the ball easily falls out of the open enclosure.<br />* The juggling balls are too dense. Was going to give this to my children to play, but these balls can do damage in your home, especially if you have things on display like collectibles, picture frames, etc. So I recommend this for outdoors only.<br /><br />I'll rate this 3-Stars simply for the lack of information and demo.",

For both kids and adults!<br />* Made of plastic, but nicely put together at this price point.<br />* Comes with two 1000 mah batteries and extra back-up propellers. I reviewed a competitor shark whose batteries are only 500 mah each.<br />* Battery compartment designed is superior to other sharks on the market. (Watch my video).<br />* Remote control uses two AAA batteries, not included.<br />* Remote control has a demo button, allowing the shark to just move on its own.<br />* Controls for this remote is more traditional. The shark can go straight by moving the left control stick forward. The control stick on the right moves horizontally left or right for turns. This is much easier for younger kids.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Remote control is bland compared to others on the market, but at least it has the basic function of allowing the shark to go straight, unlike the other one I reviewed. (Watch my video).<br />* No water shooting from the top of Shark feature like the other one I reviewed.

Press it, and water will spray from the Shark's top.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Battery compartment on shark requires the removal of 3 screws. The battery compartment of a competing product was much easier. Watch my video.<br />* Removing the battery cover from the remote control is a little convoluted. It requires pressing in a dimple, while sliding it out. I found it difficult to do. I have to press with a screw driver with one hand, and slide the cover out with the other hand.<br />* This Shark does not go straight. This is not a defect, I've seen this type of design in RC cars too. One stick controls the left turn, and one stick controls the right turn. So for it to go straight, you need to constantly balance each control stick. Not ideal for younger kids.<br /><br />Despite all the bad things I listed, I'll still rate this 4-Stars because of the price point and fun factor. But watch my video. The shark I compare it to in my video is a 5-Star.  Here's the other shark I compared this to in my video: https://www.amazon.com/review/R3QXJRAO2EAZ63/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:f60c8d38ecf6f303c318aed73eb3bcd5]] THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* All in one kit to get you started in stop motion animation.<br />* Educational, and fun.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* First off, app will be hit or miss. How is it a miss for Google Pixel Pro 6, but a hit for our dinosaur Oneplus 5t? Very basic app that is children friendly, but you'll still need to do a run-through with them first.<br />* Requires a lot of patience. 10 to 30 minutes of work and posing, for a few seconds of video.<br />* Lighting can be an issue. The best lighting is natural light. If your home is not naturally lit, and you turn on artificial lights, it can cause glares that will show up in the video because the cardboards are very glossy.<br />* Cardboard studio has gaps where light will seep in. This can also show in the video. You'll need to tape it shut.<br />* Camera tripod is terrible.<br />* The Stickbot takes a lot of patience to pose. Their rubber band joints are very confusing to sort out.<br /><br />In conclusion... honestly, I am very surprised by the popularity of this brand.  Because to get started in stop motion, you don't need this kit. You can get more real estate by getting those foam or thick boards from dollar stores. They have all sorts of colors, and green is definitely available. Or, you can buy green muslim backdrops. You can use Legos, Playmobils, any type of action figure at all, it doesn't need to be stickbots. And you can use any apps at all besides the Stickbot app, which is woefully lacking in features. So, why use this kit? I guess the one advantage they have is the Stickbot suction feet and hands. They will stay in place, which makes this ideal for children. Simply to let your children learn on their own, knowing that the video they make will be terrible. LOL! But once you see that they have a sincere interest, then perhaps you can buy them better accessories. The video clip in this review is by my 7 yr old daughter. I was surprised when she showed it to me. It's terrible, but pretty good for a 7 yr old with little patience. LOL! We'll go 3-Stars overall.",

    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />---------------<br />* Super huge, lots of fun!<br />* You need a high quality inflator to get a completely round donut. At first, I was using my Ryobi inflator which was more for basketballs and tires. Then I used a mini rechargeable inflator that was specifically made for pool inflatables. Neither of them would get this to a donut shape. Once enough air is inside, you can see it starts to take an oval shape, and you can see the bends and the creases. Weak inflators will not get by these creases. Air is just forced to escape back out where the plug input is. No matter how long I let it run. Then the very next day, I got in the mail, a 25 psi Sup Air Pump. The kind people take to the beaches to pump up their paddle boards. This guy pumped up the rider into a completely round donut and it was super fast.<br />* Small supply of vinyl patch is included.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* It takes just 2 to 3 sessions with little kids ages 7 to 10 to already do damage to this thing. LOL! We got two holes already, which I patched up with the provided adhesive vinyl.<br />* One of the wheels is already peeling from the center seat. The good thing is that, this is not a hole. Because there are 3 air plug locations. Each wheel and the center seat have their own plugs. So you're blowing up three separate components. In the event that the vinyl completely tears and all 3 components are separated, they can still be individually used. As long as the seams are tearing along the perforation, each component is still sealed. It just won't be as fun if it's no longer a hamster wheel. LOL!<br /><br />I'll rate this 4-Stars overall! I recommend having a good supply of vinyl patch. Just patch it up every time you get a hole. It's too expensive and too fun to just throw away.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:8a2a841129f89fa27807cb1af4940424]] THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* 9900 games... wow!<br />* The Pandora arcade has been around for awhile now, so you're getting one of their more powerful, and polished generations.<br />* Build quality is not bad. The acrylic glass at the top is very nice.<br />* Sticks and buttons are probably not high end Sanwa stuff, but they are good enough for casual gamers, and par for the course at this price range.<br />* HDMI and VGA outputs. I've read negative comments by others about the VGA, but I think that's because they're not familiar with this hobby. Hardcore retro gamers want and appreciate the VGA port because then they can use it with CRT monitors. They actually prefer it over HDMI because visually, CRTs are more arcade accurate. I don't care. I'm only a casual gamer, but I'm just letting you know why it's there.<br />* Many games, you're offered game saves, so you can continue next time where you left off. But I didn't see this offered for every game I tried. Some didn't offer it.<br />* Plenty of 4 player games are available, just plug in a usb gamepad. You have two usb ports in the back. Watch my video for tips. Out the box, the 3rd and 4th player usb ports do not work. You need to go into the settings. I have two kids, so it was important for me to figure this out. LOL!<br />* Customer service was very quick and responsive. I was trying to get 3rd and 4th player to work, and I figured it out before they got back to me, but they did get back to me the very next day.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Not all the games function properly. For example, Rampage World Tour has no audio. Many games seem to be duplicates, or unnecessary duplicates. Still, there are 9900 titles, so there will be plenty to keep you happy.<br />* Don't think you can turn off internal speakers. There is a volume rocker in the back, but if you lower this rocker, not only does the internal speaker go down, but whatever audio system you're connected to will go down too. I talk about this in my video.<br /><br />I think this is a 5 star product. Because the prices for these things have gone down, while the specs have gone up. If you're jumping in now, you're getting a more powerful system at a lower price than if you had jumped in 5 yrs ago. I held out. I went the retropie route. I bought an Xarcade stick and built retropie with a raspberry pi. You ultimately have a better system tailored to your liking, but the raspberry pi won't be inside the arcade stick like this Pandora system. Well, it could be, it would just take more work. Building a retro pie will end up costing more, as well as being time consuming because there is a big learning curve if you've never built one, not to mention knowing how to get the games. You can go through all that, or get yourself one of these Pandora systems and start playing immediately! 5-Stars.",

Say something, it repeats it.<br />* Takes three AA batteries at the bottom, not included.<br />* 120 songs!!!<br />* A nice, not so serious, funny toy to gift someone.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* You can skip to the next song, but you can't go back. So if you hear something you like, but accidentally kept scrolling, you'd need to scroll through the next 119 songs to get back. Or, turn it off. When you turn it on again, it starts at the Happy Birthday song. It may be quicker getting to the song you like from the Happy Birthday song than scrolling through 119 songs.<br />* Audio quality is par for the course at the price you're paying.<br />* Repeat mode is hit or miss. Sometimes it repeats you perfectly, and clearly. Other times, it repeats but the audio is terrible. Overall, I'll go 3-Stars.<br />* This is our 2nd cactus, and this one does not have a scarf, or hat like the other one.<br />* The package presentation here is better. It includes a box, which makes it very giftable. The other one we got came in a bag.<br /><br />I'm certain this dude is a white label product, meaning many sellers are getting him from the same factory. If you don't care about a box, and would like a lower price and more accessories, then check this one out: https://www.amazon.com/review/R16OZE8REFBRK9/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8<br /><br />I rate this one 3-Stars as well.",

You'll see in my pictures, it fits in a little craft box. That box is NOT included. Tiny isn't the problem. This theme is about pixels, so it should be small. The problem is the price. It doesn't feel like you're getting much material, and if families have to choose between one or the other, I don't think these things are competitive against the establishment like Legos. For the same price, you can do a lot more with Legos. I'll go 4-Stars.",

    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Very high quality components. Each piece has good weight to it.<br />* What you build is limited only by your imagination, and your patience to code and program.<br />* Two pre-programmed robots out the box in BIC and BAC. You can only choose to build one version at a time though. They are very lively, and seem to react to the environment.<br />* From the Clicbot app, you will have access to other creations that you can build. The section for this is called \"THE PLAYGROUND.\" To get instructions for a robot you want to build, you need to hit \"PLAY.\" You can then build simply looking at the completed robot, or tap to switch to step by step instructions.<br />* If you can afford it, the Maker Kit is definitely the one to get. In the app, you can keep a tally of all the components you have in \"MY MODULES.\" Underneath the \"PLAY\" button for any particular robot, there will be a message that says \"Module is insufficient, click to refresh.\" Click refresh, and you'll get to the MY MODULES tracker. Here, you can update all the modules you have, so that when you're interested in building any other robot, it'll know if you have enough for the project.<br />* Lots of fun with the family. Get you children into robotics and coding.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* As we learn more and more, I'll update, but for now, here are some noteworthy things.<br />* It seems Bac and Bic are the only builds that have any sort of A.I. I've built one other robot called \"Little Cutie,\" and I was disappointed that all the personalities of Bac or Bic were gone. They are simply RC robots when you make these other builds. You control them from your App. Like I said, I've only built one. I could be wrong, there could be AI in other builds. I'll be sure to update.<br />* The APP has a lot going on, it's cluttered. But spend some time in it, and I think you'll get used to it.<br />* The process of disassembling or removing a module is nerve racking. There is nothing in the manual, or the app that shows you how to remove modules properly. At least, I haven't found it. But you are basically yanking the pieces apart. I feel like something is going to break every time I remove a module.<br />* The sticky pads to mount the base for \"BAC\" is a one time use pad. Something that should have been mentioned in the manual. We installed on the tile floor, and wanted to move him, but it was very difficult to budge. Ultimately, we were able to remove the base, and  placed him at a different location, but the base no longer could support BAC, he kept falling. However, we found 20 other sticky pads in the accessories box. Why would that many be included? That's when we realize it's must be a one time use deal. They even sell it on their site, 20 pieces for $20 bucks. So if you don't want to waste sticky pads, I recommend choosing a go-to location for Bac, a place were you rarely have to move the base. The good thing is you can remove Bac and all his components to build other things. Just don't remove the base.<br />* The price.... yikes! I never even heard of Clicbot before this. I just accidentally bumped into this product while browsing Vine. This isn't something you buy to see if your kids have an interest in coding and robots. This is something you buy KNOWING they have a sincere interest.<br /><br />ADVICE ON INITIAL BAC OR BIC BUILD:<br />----------------------------------------------<br />* The initial process of putting together BAC or BIC can be confusing because the app takes you to a certain point, then it tells you that BAC will take over from his LCD screen, and it wants you to follow those instructions. But the confusion was BAC's screen wants to UPDATE, but then it also says, \"Wait till the entire robot is completed before updating,\" so that all modules can be updated at the same time. So the screen is not giving me any instructions cause it's waiting for the entire body to be built. But at the same time, the app no longer is giving instructions either cause it says to follow Bac. LOL! Ultimately, what I realized is that you go ahead and update anyways. BAC's screen will ask for a confirmation if the entire robot has been assembled, this is where you lie and say YES, ASSEMBLED. LOL!  But once it updates the module, it'll know it isn't complete, and it'll give you the next step. Once you connect the next module, go ahead and update again. You're just updating the modules one by one as you're building it. There was a lot of confusion, but somehow we got through and built BAC. I think the company needs to go back to the drawing board on this initial process.<br /><br />FUTURE FIRMWARE SUGGESTIONS:<br />------------------------------------------<br />* Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant integration, or something independent like what Vector by Anki has.<br />* They should make a tempered glass screen protector for the screen, or even a basic film protector.<br />* Remote viewing utilizing the onboard camera. This way you can control the robot around the house and see what he sees. I can do this with Vector, but it wasn't something Anki or Digital Dreams Lab did. It was accomplished by 3rd party developers. So I know this is something the Clicbot team can absolutely do if they wanted to.<br /><br />This was our first day playing with it, and I just wanted to get a review up. I will definitely update as I learn more. Overall, this is still 5-Stars because it is serious tech. If I time travelled from the 1980's to 2022, I would be blown away by this. We are living in the future. 5-Stars.",

Each of the pieces feel great in the hands due to their weight.<br />* My favorite is the hypnotic flowing helix, to the backdrop of Twilight Zone music. LOL!<br />* The playing cards are terrific. They are slightly smaller than standard Bicycle cards. Time will tell if they actually do last longer. Watch my video if you're a card handler, you'll see you can do pretty much the same manipulations as you can with normal decks.<br />* Perfect gift set for a business person, it is indeed classy. But honestly, anybody would be thrilled to get this set. Even people who dabble in magic, such as myself. We constantly have cards in our hands, coins, anything to fidget and manipulate.<br />* Customer service is top notch!<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* At this price range, I expect perfection, but one of my pieces came with nicks and dents. I contacted the seller, and they shipped a replacement ASAP, and no questions asked. I suspect this manufacture defect is just a fluke. In any case, they will take care of you swiftly.

    "text": "REVIEW UPDATE JUNE 30, 2022:<br />---------------------------------------<br />* We were finally able to take this tank for a spin. It is indeed super fun. But here are 3 noteworthy things:<br /><br />1.) It is gigantic, adult supervision is required to make sure kids get in and out of it safely. Never allow them to stand up to get out. Buoyancy can cause them to flip and hit the side of the pool cement. So make sure they simply crawl off the tank slowly and safely, like rolling out of bed. LOL!<br />2.)  It takes forever to blow it up, even with an electronic inflator. So if you want to avoid anxious kids, then prepare it the day before, or at least 30 minutes before swim time.<br />3.) The water gun is not as I imagined. There is no trigger. It's a pump action. A clear straw/pipe dangles through the bottom into the pool, so you can constantly pump water. It is difficult for little children. So the idea that whoever is in the tank has the advantage is wrong. LOL! In our pool, we all have water guns, and whoever is in the tank becomes the target. LOL!  Nevertheless, it's still very fun, and the 5-Star rating is justified.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW MAY 4th, 2022:<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />---------------<br />* Seems like super fun!<br />* 61\"x44\"x24\" is a very substantial size. So this is not for little above ground pools.<br />* The vinyl feels pretty standard. It did not feel thin or cheap.<br />* Everything seems to be complete. It even included little repair stickers in case you get holes.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Well, we won't exactly know yet until the summer. I got this for the upcoming summer, and I'll be sure to update. My kids can't wait. For now, gotta give it 5-Stars.",

Weighs 2.3 ounces in the hands.<br />* Smooth finish, nice build quality.<br />* Some may find it hard to make the sounds, but it's simply a knack that you'll gain if you play with it a lot.<br />* Comes with a back up internal wheel with the mini ball bearings.<br />* Hearing the click is very satisfying. LOL!<br />* Be different than everyone who's playing with the spinning fidgets.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* If you tend to get moist or clammy hands, it will be difficult. The fidget will just slide in your hands. Regardless, this is a 5-Star fidget/toy.",

I will confirm this with more testing. But regardless, this is too cool, and I still rate it 5-Stars.",

They'll ask you to enter the code on the sku label of your box. Don't enter the actual sku, you'll want to input \"P29501.\"<br />* All the lights work! That's the biggest fear with kits like these. But mine was perfect! You are advised to test all the lights too before you start. If there are any that are defective, you should contact the seller for replacements before you get started.<br />* This will take several hours. You'll need mental stamina to follow the instructions. This isn't something you can just casually do while watching TV. It's not difficult or anything, it just requires a lot of focus and attention to details. Well, to be honest, I had the NBA playoffs on. LOL! But with sports, you can just hear, you don't have to watch. I was completely zoned in on this project.<br />* You can power it by connecting a usb cable, or using a AA battery pack. Both options are provided.<br />* The end result is absolutely worth it. I love how the torch light slowly flickers, a very nice touch. I included a lot of pictures to show you how involved the process is. This way, you can decide whether or not you want to pursue this project.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Nothing at all. 5-Stars!",

Be sure to explain why the answer is the answer, otherwise this short-cut chart could actually be detrimental. What is 9x8?

LOL!<br />* The spin function is very smooth, glides perfectly.<br />* Comes with 8 general terms, but the wheels are customizable with templates from their website. I plan to make plates with answers exactly like the Mystic Seer in the Twilight Zone.<br />* Can use as keychain or Christmas ornament.<br /><br />HOW TO CUSTOMIZE:<br />--------------------------<br />* Mine did not come with any instructions, but I contacted the sellers and here are the instructions:<br /><br />Step 1: Twist the top and bottom shell to open the Fidget roulette<br />Step 2: Remove the Sticker with our logo. (It will reveal a screw)<br />Step 3: Remove the screw while holding the front dial with the “?” (This will give you access to the Answer Wheel)<br />Step 4: Go to Fidgetroulette.com , download the Answer Wheel you desire and print it (If you don't have sticker paper available, you can use regular paper and use paper glue)<br />Step 5: put it back together and have fun!<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Nothing at all, this is really fun.

    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Makes a kid's room look cooler.<br />* Makes tidying up laundry fun.<br />* Ball and pump included.<br />* Easy over the door hanger.<br />* Laundry bag has a zipper at the bottom, so you can dump the clothes into a different basket instead of having to unhook actual bag. (But more on this below)<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* I don't know what I was expecting, but I was underwhelmed. It doesn't seem much thought was put into this. I expected an easy system for taking down and putting back up the bag. But that wasn't what Nerf had in mind, that is why they designed a zipper at the bottom of the bag. They know it's a hassle to take down the bag. But it seems ridiculous to have to use a different laundry basket when it's time to actually take out the laundry. LOL! The reason it would be a hassle to take down the bag is because there are 4 drawstring loops on the bag. Two of them hang on dedicated hooks in the back of the backboard. The two front loops is where the hassle comes into play. There are no dedicated hooks for these. You have to squeeze them into the rim's net hooks, which are already occupied by the basketball net. That's why I say squeeze, it's already tight due to the net. BTW, they don't tell you this in the manual. It's something you just logically figure out yourself. There is nowhere else to hang those loops other than to share them with the rim's net hooks. If they would just add two more dedicated hooks for the bag somewhere in the front of the rim, taking down the bag would be easy.<br />* The reason why I'm harping about this or expected more is because we already have higher quality official NBA hoops that are made for over the door too. I had already thought of hanging a bag with drawstrings and force it to share the rim's net hooks. I actually have thought of that before, and I didn't do it. I thought this product that was specifically made for this purpose would provide a better solution. It did not, it is almost the same solution I had in mine. LOL!<br />* I will come up with a solution that will make it easy to take down and put back up the bag... Velcro comes to mine.<br /><br />3-Stars.",

You need to press the square with the piece before and after each move.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-----------<br />* Learning curve to understand all the buttons and navigation is substantial. You must read the manual that's included.<br />* I said it feels retro, which I actually like, but this is subjective. I can see someone just give up and download an app to learn instead. Instead of navigating and studying these buttons, I'm pretty sure the latest chess learning in app in 2022 would be more convenient.<br />* So skip this product if you have little patience.<br />* The price... hmm, I'm not sure this is worth $80. A bigger LCD that's more easily readable would justify the cost, but not as is currently constructed.<br /><br />Despite listing a few cons. I like this chess set.

    "text": "This set is very cute. It's perfect for all children who are unicorn fans like my daughter. There are some pretty cool accessories inside such as headbands, a necklace, coin purse, rings, stickers and of course the stuff animal unicorn. The entire box weighs 1 lb. and 4 ounces, which is surprising since it feels lighter than that. The box is cardboard, but has metal looking handle and clasp, but I think they're chrome plated plastic. The main feature of this set for me was the box. I was hoping it would be high quality enough to last for many years. A go-to box for my daughter to stash her trinkets. But at this price, I guess I shouldn't have expected too much. I'll go 4-stars overall.",

So I weighed it and sure enough, most of our other cars are less than 2 lbs, mostly 1.5 lbs. This RLARRLO car checked in at 2.5 lbs. You can feel the quality.<br />* Alluminum alloy chasis.<br />* Brushed 550 motor with shock absorbers, and metal heat sink.<br />* Rubber tires have great treads.<br />* Two 7.4v 1800mah batteries.<br />* Control distance is 150m.<br />* Most components can be replaced, upgraded, etc. Very customizable for the RC enthusiast.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-----------<br />* Nothing really, but if you force me to pick something... I'd say it's not waterproof. We have other RC cars that can jump into our pool. We'll have to keep this one dry. Still, this car is 5-Stars!",

    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* If you watch Battlebots, you'll understand why this is so cool.<br />* Over 300 parts, 2 bluetooth batteries, 6 cubit motors.<br />* 2 players, and they can choose from 5 robot designs.<br />* They say it's compatible with your BRICKS, which is code for LEGOS!<br />* If Mom gets upset at more toys on the floor, tell her this is STEM. She can't get too mad about that. LOL!<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Nothing! My son and I watch Battlebots, so when I saw this, I had to get it. Can't wait to do this product with him. 5-Stars!",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:a47326bb48b328d18558c86fcccc38a1]] THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Very high quality. The handle alone is 12.4 ounces.<br />* USB-C charging port.<br />* Belt clip included.<br />* Decorative blade plug is included. This is cool if you just want to display the handle without the blade. You can cap off your handle with this decorative plug.<br />* Bottom of the hilt is a decorative speaker cap instead of a pommel/coupling.<br />* Hilt is 1-1/4 inch. This will connect with other 1.25 inch handles to create a duo saber. Another dominant size on the market is a smaller 1 and 1/8th diameter version. This one will not thread onto 1.25 hilts, so to create duo sabers with different brands, be sure the hilts are the same size.<br />* All the special effects are pretty much standard: Lock up effect, changing colors, steady, pulse, unstable, etc. This version also has quotes. Watch my video to see a demo<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Pommel or coupling is not included. As mentioned above, bottom of the hilt is a decorative speaker cap. When you remove this speaker cap, the bottom of this hilt will be male. So to create the duo saber, your other saber should have a coupling so that it's female.<br />* My light saber did not charge properly out the box. When you plug it in to charge, it'll loudly announce, \"Charging!\" Then the red light will blink slowly. When it is complete, it will say, \"READY,\" and the red light will be stable, no blinking. Chances are you're not going to be present when the saber says READY. But as long as you see the red light is stable and not blinking, then you'll know it's fully charged. My issue was that after 10 hrs of charging, the red light was still blinking slowly, and the saber wouldn't turn on. I contacted customer support and they had a solution ready to go. So this seems like a common problem. I talk about this at the end of my video, so watch it if you have a charging issue. My saber is charging properly now. So the word to describe this saber is, finicky.<br /><br />I'll give this an overall rating of 4-Stars.",

Look at the pictures, and notice the frame, it's all wood. Because of that the whole unit looks a little unfinished. But it's fine leaving it as is.<br />* This version also has a leather handle on the side.<br />* Mass produced wooden products always make me nervous. Many will come with scrapes, scratches, chips, dents, etc. But the quality control here is very good, at least in my case. Nothing was damaged.<br />* The four drawers can be completely removed.<br />* Workspace is approximately 30x24.5 inches and can fit most 1000 piece puzzles.<br />* Flat and and can easily be stowed away under your bed.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* The pad on top feels a little cheap, and came wrinkled.

    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* 1500 piece board is the biggest on the market.<br />* 6 magnetic drawers total.<br />* Combination of of wood and fiberboard or MDF materials. The finish is very smooth.<br />* Large matt basically covers the entire board. The material of the mat is the same as you would fine for computer desk or mouse pads. It's like a giant mouse pad.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* With wooden products, my pet peeve are imperfections to the wood. I feel wooden products should be shipped with utmost protection, and this was not. Barely any padding inside, and one of our corners is dented. This would be 5-Stars, I have to knock off 1 star for the dented corner.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:cd131599fe352cad31ef03a30268e27c]] NOV 16, 2021 UPDATE:<br />----------------------------<br />* This is a very proactive company. Upon reading my review, they reached out to me to explain that some of their inventory did not have English manuals. They've since attached the English manual via PDF under the \"Product guides and documents\" section of the Amazon listing. After looking at the English manual, it will definitely help us finish this project. I said in my original review, this would be a 5 star product if not for the lack of instructions, so now there is. So I will change my rating. Thank you very much.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />----------------------<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* High quality metal components.<br />* High quality tools included.<br />* Very cool, giftable packaging.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-----------<br />* I'm very curious by the other great reviews that are not mentioning the elephant in the room. The instructions are not in English! Technically, you can get away with just looking at the pictures, but it will be a strain for your eyes. You'll need to scan the pictures and zoom in for more clarity to see where exactly the nuts and bolts are going.<br />* Throughout the manual, there are important notes they want you to understand. These tips and notes are highlighted in red with an exclamation mark! Unfortunately, you won't understand what's so important. LOL!<br />* Think this will be a cool project to spend some time with your kid? Think again.<br />* Watch my video to understand my annoyance. This could be 5-Stars, but I'm going 3 for the lack of instructions.",

LOL! No, really. Very cute.<br />* The best feature about this box is the ability to send messages or tell your own stories by recording yourself using the app or computer. You do not need to physically be in the same location as the box or figure. This is a terrific feature for grandparents who are not in the same home. They can always send messages and stories.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* I'm not sure how long kids above 6 yrs old will give this time and attention. We've already spoiled them to the wonders and possibilities of tablets. This may seem like a baby's toy to them. So it's a gamble if you want to purchase this for older elementary kids. For toddlers around 2 to 5, I think this is a great gift.<br />* Each figure or Tonie is about $15, so the cost can add up as you want to expand your library.<br /><br />Despite the few gripes about age and price adding up, I'll still rate this 5-Stars because I think it's an awesome idea, and will be a home-run for kids around 2 to 5.",

They don't make them like they used to, but this one feels fairly well made. Each piece snaps into place nicely, very rigid. I grew up with the standard blue and white color combo, or the red and white combo. My daughter loves rainbows, so I had to get this colorful one for her. There are 6 different colors on this 24 piece version. 5-Stars!",

    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Lots of cool colorful artwork on the packaging. So as a collector, you can enjoy this Prime without removing him from the box.<br />* The plastic is not cheap light weight. It is a denser type of high quality plastic.<br />* Converting to robot is an easy automatic feature. Transforming back to truck requires good old fashion step by step moves using your hands.<br />* Energon Armor accessories included.<br />* Ten sound effects, as well as chest lighting effect. Batteries are included for this.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* I'm not sure if this has enough to pry my son away from his tablet and games. We live in such a tech world that kids are growing out of it quicker than when we were kids in the 80's and 90's. I remember enjoying toys even through junior high. My kid is in 3rd grade and is already growing out of toys. :( I'm hoping this Optimus Prime can spark something. We'll go 4-Stars.",

    "title": "Beautiful jeep, but read my review to avoid some potential headaches...",
    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* This is a super detailed 1:12 scale military jeep.<br />* Windshield wipers move, steering wheel moves.<br />* Removable shovel and axe latched to the driver side of the jeep. So much detail.<br />* Jeep clocks in at 1 lb. 5.6 oz. Without battery.<br />* Remote transmitter weights 5.5 oz. Without batteries. It takes four AAA batteries not included.<br />* Packaging is also very unique designed as some sort of ration or equipment container you would find in the military.<br />* Headlights, tail lights, emergency lights, lots of lights!<br />* Jeep is high quality<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* At this price, are you really going to take it outside? We have several other RCs in the home and we smash those cars up good. Their plastic shells are made to be smashed, and replaced. This Jeep is more of a collectible. With all the detail and fragile moving parts, you will no doubt break something if you take this to the gravel.<br />* With all the attention paid to the details, I am surprised not a lot of attention was paid to helping us open the hood. The manual just says open the hood to install the battery. Well, this thing is $250, I don't want to break anything. The hood wouldn't open. I eventually figured out that there are two tabs on the sides of the hood that needs to be removed. Look at my pictures to see exactly what you need to remove. Now even after removing these clips the hood wouldn't open. That's because I use very little strength, I didn't want to force anything. But after mauling around for awhile, I figure there is nothing left I need to remove, so I just used extra force to pop the hood, and luckily that was the proper way to do it. There is a clip inside that keeps it from popping up during play, which is the reason why you need to use a little force to pop it open. Maybe these tabs that you need to remove is common sense in this type of model, and experience collectors know this. But the manual shouldn't assume this, they should always write manuals as if they are writing for an audience of new collectors.<br />* As for the remote controller, there is no room for error, no tolerance for AAA batteries that may slightly differ in diameter. I have found out through experience with other toys that rechargeable batteries can be slightly bigger in diameter than alkaline batteries. Just slightly, I mean your naked eyes can't see the difference. But the battery compartment of some toys are made with no wiggle room, such as the case with this controller. I popped in four AAA rechargeable batteries, but I didn't check the level of the batteries. The controller wouldn't turn on, so I had to remove them to charge them. This was when I found out my big problem!!! The batteries wouldn't come out. With some force and gravity, the top two batteries fell out, but the bottom two were stuck for good. Manual says, do not unscrew or take apart the controller, which was exactly what I had to do, as well as using a micro flat head screwdriver to do some prying. Ultimately, I was able to free the bottom two batteries. I used regular alkaline AAA batteries afterwards, and they slide in and out with no issues. So this is my warning to you.... DO NOT USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES, or you will have a good time just like me.<br /><br />Beautiful jeep, but I'm knocking 2 stars for what I experience setting this jeep up. The manual should have gave more guidance on how to open the hood, and the remote controller needs to be more tolerant of rechargeable batteries that may differ in size slightly than alkaline batteries.",

In the Magic collectibles world, brass and wood magic products are the most collectible.<br />* Spectator will handle the gimmick the entire process, until you take it back to perform your x-ray vision.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-----------<br />* Nosey family members, problem solvers, college students, etc., should not be handed the gimmick after the performance.. they will figure it out. This was one of the first tricks I ever owned as a kid, so when I saw this, I had to get it for my son. He still hasn't figured it out yet, but he's 8. Smart teenagers or College students can figure it out easily if you let them examine it all day. But they say in magic, if it ever gets to that point where people want to examine your props, then your whole presentation is wrong. Try to entertain and do magic. Don't make it seem like puzzles, or brain teasers, because then spectators view it as a challenge they have to figure out.<br /><br />5-Stars!",

    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Perfectly priced toy for the quality you're getting.<br />* Collectible.<br />* Like Rock-Em Sockem, but with electronics, and the figures will split when getting knocked out.<br />* This version come with an arena, but you can fight without it if you wish.<br />* Two warriors included to get you started.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-----------<br />* Nothing I can think of. The price is just right for what you're getting. I don't recall an actual arcade game in the past called Akedo. It seems this toy is simply inspired by all the classic arcade fighting games such as Street Fighter, Fatal Fury, Tekken, etc. It will keep your children occupied for awhile and away from tablets.<br /><br />One more thing, the two default figures that's already installed in the arena have clear bands wrapped around them. We saw the vertical bands on their bodies and cut them off. But when we battled, we still couldn't split each other. My son realize there are more tiny bands in the neck that needs to be cut. So if you're playing for awhile, and you can't knock anybody out, check to see if rubber bands are still holding their bodies tight. You can manually check... you are free of bands when you can pop their heads back and split their bodies. If you can't do that, it probably means there are some bands you still need to cut off.<br /><br />5-Stars!",

    "text": "I recently got a different gatling bubble gun. So we thought this is the same, just different color. Boy were we wrong. This thing is super tiny. This is my pet peeve in marketing. Blow up stock photos to make them look bigger than life. They do reveal the size the gun in the 5th picture, but still, they know what they're doing. The fine print is in the 5th pictures because they're hoping you don't look no further after the first few pictures. It is my pet peeve. The other gun we reviewed is 17 inches long, sound effects and bubble holder. Look at our pictures for a comparison. This tiny gun has no bubble holder, the bubble is poured into a separate mini tray where you then dip your gun. But you know what, it works very well. It makes a lot of bubbles. But how is it that this tiny gun can cost more than the 17 inch gun here? https://www.amazon.com/review/R3JT58F8EGI924/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B092ZGX4G6<br /><br />For essentially the same money... which would you buy? The only reason I'm not going to give this gun a 1 star for being misleading in product photos, as well as being overpriced compared to bigger better guns, is because my little girl had a lot of fun with it.

To load it up, you dip it in your pool or bucket of water and you pull the pump/plunger up like a syringe until the tubes are full.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-----------<br />* As mentioned above, you load water by pulling up the pump/plunger like a syringe. Well, just like a syringe, you only get one shot. You can break it down into multiple shots by not pushing the plunger back all the way, but little by little, but that's no fun cause the water doesn't travel far. So to really have fun, you have to do a full one shot blast. In the product's stock photos, seller compares this gun to other guns and demonstrating how this gun has more capacity. Well, I think that's a bit misleading because this is not a traditionally water gun. A lower capacity traditional water gun will last longer before you have to refill. This gun requires reloading after every shot. This can be considered a hassle or nuisance.<br /><br />It's unique, it's high quality, I'll still rate this 4-Stars!",

At least Altair does not claim their shell is durable and won't break like other sellers. The shell will absolutely break.<br />* A bit of a learning curve for kids when it comes to steering.<br />* The locking pins is a bit of a hassle. You cannot get to the battery from the bottom, you need to get to it from the top, so you need to remove some pins to remove the shell. Each locking pin has two ridges, I don't know the proper lingo, lets just call it ridges. You don't need to push the pin pass the second ridge. Once it passes the first ridge, you should be good. If you want to push it pass the second ridge, you'll need pliers because your fingers will hurt. But I figure you don't need to since that's how it came out the box, all the pins were only passed the first ridge.<br /><br />We'll rate this RC car 4-Stars!",

When you put the boat on water, it becomes activated, so there is no on/off button on the boat. They provide you with two batteries for the boat, one to serve as back-up.

We have not experienced any stuck darts like you normally would with these types of \"nerf\" toys.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-----------<br />* They seem to be very precise with batteries. It requires 4 AAA batteries. Normally, that's all you need to say, right? But they go on to say it works best with Energizer Ultimate, can also be used with Energizer Max, and Duracell Ultra Power. They advised against rechargeable NIMH 1.2v batteries. Basically any brand should work, just don't use nimh batteries. But I get the feeling, the gun might shoot better and even faster with Energizer Ultimate.<br /><br />Until I encounter batteries I can't use, I still rank this 5-Stars! Of all my kid's nerf type toys, I enjoy this one the most.",

    "text": "March 20, 2021 UPDATE:<br />-----------------------------<br />After our family completed this project, I would recommend using very little glitter or no glitter at all. For some reason, I had envision the glitter working like traditional snow globes where the snow settles at the bottom, then you shake it and the snow floats all over the place. Well, this isn't \"snow,\" this is glitter. They simply cling and stick. They will cling to the bottom, to your sculptures, even to the dome, some will even be floating at the top. When you shake your globe, the glitter DOES NOT move. In hindsight, I would have preferred no glitter because they cover your work. So my advice is to use sparingly, or not at all. Still a 5-Star kit!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />----------------------<br />This is going to be so much fun for the kids. The kit looks great! Very cute, and It comes with four figurines to supplement whatever your kids will be creating with the clay. The display domes are good quality. Hard plastic and acrylic. It has to be if its going to hold water. This will be a fun session for the kids, as well as the parents. 5-Stars!",

    "text": "Nah, I would pass on this. Normally, I would say the end result doesn't matter, it's the process and the family time that counts, but even the process was basically nothing. All you do is stir the crystal powder in boiling water until it all melts. That's it, nothing else for the kids to do. Sit back and wait for the underwhelming results. The crystal forms  a square at the base, so you'll need to break it up in order to fit it on the circular display. The black base and clear dome display are cheap thin plastic. The kind of plastic that is used in packaging that you would normally throw away. The crystal cannot stay still on the base because the dome does not clip onto the base tightly. It just covers the base loosely, so if it moves, the crystal inside moves. We threw away the dome lids, and simply flip the base upside down to use as a tray to hold the crystal, and all it's broken crumbs. That's another thing, it's very brittle. The Science is interesting though. I think I'm most annoyed at the display cases actually. The stock photos make it seem like you're getting glass display cases, or at least acrylic, and the black base looks like hard plastic. What you get is the type of thin plastics used as tray liners in packaging, the flimsy stuff you throw away. 2-Star.",

This guy is going to stay indoors to stay mint and pretty forever. It'll be a challenge though because it's really fast for a tank, and it climbs so easily. The doors actually open, and a perfectly scale figure to seat in this tank would be one of those 3.75 inch GI Joes from the 80's. The battery compartment also houses the charging cable, which is a pleasant surprise. Because charging cables are getting outta control in our house.

    "text": "These silver coins weigh 1.7 ounces per 10 coins, so 35 coins in the bag will be around 6 ounces. We have collected all the versions of these coins... gold, silver and bronze.

In case you're curious the golds are 2.2 ounces per 10, and the bronze are .9 ounces per 10.

    "text": "This has been so disappointing. All I can say is read carefully their list of compatible devices because they mean it. If it's not on that list, it's not going to work. Usually, a list of compatible devices are just a guideline and apps are programmed to be very versatile. Not this app! We have a few iPads in the house, an older iPad which is stuck on IOS 10, so you can't even download the app. But we also have an iPad Air 2 running iOS 14.4, so we figure this one satisfies the iOS 13 and up requirement. No it does not. The Arpedia app will run, but there is NO SOUND.  Then I noticed on their list, they don't list Air 2, they only list iPad Air 3. So not only does it have to be running iOS 13 and up, it has to be a specific model as well. I asked about this audio issue in the Q&A, and their answer was simplistic. They say my DO NOT DISTURB might be turned on. However, I checked and it is NOT turned on. If that's the case, my other apps wouldn't have audio either, but they are fine. It is only the Arpedia app that has no audio.<br /><br />On the Android side, usually apps are programed to run on Android, or not, PERIOD. You either make it work for Android, or you don't. I rarely encounter apps, such as Arpedia, that requires a specific model or brand. So again, you should look at the compatibility list and take the list seriously. We have several Android devices, we found one that worked, a Winnovo P20, but the video is UPSIDE DOWN. Turning on or off the auto rotate in the settings didn't help. If we want the video on screen to be right side up, then we have to flip the book on the table upside down. If we want the book to be right side up, the the video on screen will be upside down. LOL! We also tried several Amazon Fire HD that have the Playstore and google services sideloaded. We get the app to launch, and it will go through the process of recognizing and downloading the book you want to read, but then when it comes time to launch the book, the app crashes.<br /><br />So basically if you have the latest and greatest products such as Samsung, or newest iPads, you're probably good to go. Everyone else, you can skip this product. It's not ready for a wider audience. Too bad because the materials look interesting, and my kids were just waiting on the sidelines for Dad to make it work, but I couldn't.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:acf24d91cee31c0de845571b6cd24d7b]] This is a very nice light saber. Good heft to it with lots of features. There will be a learning curve, but hopefully my tips as well as the video demo will make it easier for you. Remember that it is all in the blinking:<br /><br />After assembling and charging your saber, you start off in SLEEP mode, meaning NOTHING should be illuminated. Hold the power button until the power ring illuminates and you hear a voice saying POWER ON. Now this is called OFF/AWAKE mode. Off meaning the lights/effects are not turned on yet, but the power button ring is illuminated. More on this OFF/AWAKE state later. But here, you simply tap the button to turn on the lights and effects. Now you are in ON/AWAKE mode, and here are the commands for ON/AWAKE mode:<br /><br />ON/AWAKE MODE COMMANDS:<br />-------------------------------------<br />ONE BLINK: Hold the button until it BLINKS one time, then release. LOCK-UP effect is now enabled. It basically sounds like your saber just hit some electrical wires and is going crazy. Tap the button to get out of it.<br /><br />TWO BLINKS: Hold the button until it BLINKS twice, then release. The saber will cycle through the color choices. Once you like a color, tap to set your color choice.<br /><br />THREE BLINKS: Hold the button until it BLINKS three times, then release. You will hear a quote from the movies. To hear a different quote, hold until it BLINKS three times again, then release. Basically keep holding and releasing after three blinks to cycle through the quotes.<br /><br />FOUR BLINKS: This turns OFF the lights/effects. But, the power ring is still illuminated, which means you are back to OFF/AWAKE mode, and here are the commands for OFF/AWAKE mode:<br /><br />OFF/AWAKE MODE COMMANDS:<br />--------------------------------------<br />ONE BLINK: This allows you to set the sound volume. You can set between NO SOUND, LOUD SOUND,  and SOFT SOUND.<br /><br />TWO BLINKS: This is for light effects. You can have it STABLE, UNSTABLE, or PULSE. Stable gives a consistent solid light, which is what I have on during my demo because it's easier to capture on video.<br /><br />THREE BLINKS: This is for setting a theme music. You can cycle through 5 songs, and the 6th is no music. So if you leave it at any one of the songs, whenever to turn on the lights/effects, music will be on too. So if you don't want any music, make sure you cycle all the way to no music.<br /><br />FOUR BLINKS: You can cycle through more movie quotes, one of which is, \"The force is with you Luke...\"<br /><br />LASTLY, to put it sleep. Hold the button for 10 seconds, so when you do this. It will go through its blinking, but just disregard them until the red illumination is completely off. This takes about 10 seconds. You are now in SLEEP mode. The same mode as when you first assembled and charged the saber. To play again, hold the power button until it illuminates, and you are back to OFF/AWAKE mode.",

    "text": "My children got their first Bingo experience with this set, and they love it! You need manually remove the Bingo balls like those plastic car model kits where you have to remove the parts from a plastic frame. Just twist the bingo balls and they will fall off the frame. Some may have rough plastic edges still attached to them, so I use a nail filer to smooth it out. There are 75 bingo balls total. They provide you with 500 bingo chips, 50 game boards, 2 drawstring pouches, and a master board to double check the winning numbers. In terms of storage, I feel the best place to store the bingo balls is actually in the metal cage itself, not the drawstring pouch. I simply use a twisty tie to prevent the scoop mechanism from moving. This way, if the cage moves around, the scoop won't work, so it won't accidentally spit out a bingo ball. BTW, the quality of the bingo balls are pretty good for being plastic. When I saw that they came in plastic frames that you have to remove, I feared the bingo balls would be cheap and hollow, but it doesn't feel that way at all. We give this set 5-stars all the way!",

The banner is fine, but the balloons are the cheapest balloons I've ever encountered my whole life. These things keep popping while we were inflating them. And the ones that didn't pop, they started popping in the middle of the night. I decided to take all the balloons we blew and purposely popped them in the garage in the middle of the night. Because I didn't want the kids to be playing with them the next day. These are super thin balloons. If you use them, blow them to half of their capacity to be safe. Changing review to 3 Stars.<br /><br />Original review:<br />-----------------<br />My little girl loves rainbows and unicorns, so when I saw this, I had to grab it. The backdrop will need to hang for a few days, or ironed out if you mind the creases and wrinkles. When I first opened up the backdrop, I wasn't impressed. I couldn't see the colors. But this is one of those things where you have to hang it up and take a step back, then you can see the colors from afar. Up close, it looks faded. The balloon array arching over the backdrop is exactly how we're going to set it up. Everything looks to be good quality. 5-Stars!",

    "text": "This thing is a blast outdoors, but for indoors and not enough runway, it's a little too powerful for my kids to handle. You can't press the trigger too long, or your truck will go slamming into your furniture and walls. The control is super accurate though. Release the trigger and it stops on a dime. I know you can spend 4 to 5 times this if you truly get into it and become a RC enthusiasts. This is more than enough for my kids who are not yet 10. But the truth is, this one is for daddy. LOL! The best feature of this RC car compared to others is the amphibious feature. It can go on water. We gave it a shot, and it moves exactly like that in the stock video, meaning pretty slow, and it needs to use more battery when it's in water. It's not fun in water, but nevertheless, it's a cool feature to have if you have a pool in your backyard. We were letting it fly off the steps and into the pool, and sometimes it landed on it's back, but won't drown. It's supposed to be water proof, so I'll update this review if anything happens to it.<br /><br />My only concern is that I've seen this exact car in a different color scheme with a different brand slapped on it. So for such a high priced car, it's a little concerning that it's essentially a white label product. Meaning it's sold to anybody from a manufacture, most likely from China, and anybody can put their own logo on it.  So it's not from a known company who you know will be around should you need customer or tech service. If you're not worried about that, this seems like a great car so far.<br /><br />-Great suspension<br />-Rugged body<br />-2x 9.6V 900mAh Ni-MH Batteries<br />-2 x USB Charging Cable<br />-1 Remote<br /><br />Put a camera on this thing and have fun!",

    "text": "First off, the instructions are near the back pages of the book. Wouldn't it make more sense if it were in the front? I didn't know this, so I was searching youtube, even went to their website, etc. just to watch videos to figure out how things worked. I took a picture of the instructions to save you some hair pulling.<br /><br />The touch buttons to hear their default voice works pretty well, but it's when you want to record your own voice is when it gets iffy. You have to hold it to hear a beep, but sometimes the beep won't come. Now when it does beep and you're done with reading the page, you have to hold it again to hear a double beep to confirm it saved. If you don't hold again to hear the double beep, then it will keep recording. The biggest gripe I have is why in the world did they put the save/rec switch in the battery compartment? Why isn't it on the side with the rest of the controls? Every time you want to record, which will be many times!! Because your kids will be like, \"Me, me, record me!\" You have to take a a screwdriver to open the compartment, switch to rec, do your thing, switch back to save, then screw the battery cap back on. And you have to do that every time your kids want to record again. And you should let them record over and over because they're improving and perfecting their reading. BTW, it takes 3 AAA batteries, which they do include.<br /><br />So in conclusion, the touch buttons could use some improvement, the save/rec switch should be moved to the side, and lastly, they should lower the price. I don't know if many people will collect beyond 1 book if it's $40 a pop. I think this needs to be more affordable. 3-Stars!",

There is no way this thing should sell for $99, it's still a bit overpriced at $50. Some issues...<br /><br />1. Our set came with 2 Saturn Arms, missing the Neptune arm. So we had to do a replacement with Amazon.<br /><br />2. Inserting the pin rods in the planets, then into the arms. This was a pain. There is no way an 8 yr old would have been able to do this. I had to put on gloves to get a good grip to push the pins into the planets. Some of them, you hear a click, and some of them, you get no clicks no matter how hard you push.<br /><br />3. The center projector that projects each planet is TERRIBLE. You need all the lights off, and you need the whole system to be close to the ceiling for you to see what planet its projecting. Out of focused and blurry. No way to focus it. The only way to get a sharper image is to put the project as close as possible to the wall.<br /><br />4. Though the arms rotate around the sun, the individual planets do not rotate. So to explain night and day to your child, you'll need to manually rotate Earth. That would be asking too much, but hey, I thought this retails for $99? If they did charge $99, those planets better rotate by themselves. LOL!<br /><br />3 stars.",

    "text": "Product listing says 12 yrs and up. Don't listen to it. If you have kids as young as 4 and starting to learn adding and subtracting, this game will be super educational! My youngest is 5 and she bugs us every day to play this game. Kids under 12 will love this game, trust me. It's not just adding and subtracting, for more advance play, you can do multiplication, division, any math you can think of. Lets say your roll a 4 and a 3, but you're out of tiles to make 7. But you have a 9 and a 3 in play, well if multiplication is part of the game then 4x3 is 12, hence, you can shut the 9 and 3 tiles. Lets say you roll a 5 and a 4, but you have no more tiles that add up to 9, but you have a 3 in play. What's the square root of 9? It's 3, now you can shut that 3. Any math you can think of is fair game, that's how we play it. Play this game with your kids, and they will learn math faster! 5-Stars.",

It is especially a great opportunity for parent/child bonding time. We already put together a similar robot that is half the cost of this one. So if you wanna give this a try, but weary of its quality. If the less a expensive one a try first: https://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6IM925W9SS9/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8<br /><br />App and packaging logo looks the same, so it's by the same manufacture. But these are white label items from China. Meaning different sellers will sell them under different brand names. But they all seem to use the same MOULD KING app. If you own several of these robots, you can access all their controls under this Mould King app. I made a screen recording to demonstrate. However, this app is NOT available in the Google Play store. You'll need to use a QR scanner to scan their code, and it'll take you to a link to download. But it is available in the Apple Store.<br /><br />Overall, we like these toys a lot. The only thing that keeps it from being 5-Stars, is the lack of Google Play certification.",

If he veers right, then release the left button, so that he veers back left, if he veers left, then release the right button. You'll get the picture! One last thing, once the batteries are screwed in place, there are no on/off buttons to manage. Once you put the head on the water, it will activate. Once you take it out of the water, it will deactivate. It knows to not drain your batteries when out of the water. I've tested this by seeing if it holds a charge after a week of inactivity, and it absolutely did.  Very neat toy, and easy to manage since there is nothing to turn off. Simply take it out of the water!",

The one good thing is that there is some hand/eye coordination in play, so your children well get some development. You see they have to view an app, which shows a speedometer. They need to keep the needle at a certain speed. Speedometer graphics is broken down into 2 colors, blue and red. If you go to the red, chances are good your car will fly off the tracks. How do you control the speed? By pumping the booster. The faster you pump, the needle will move towards the red. So you need to time yourself and not pump too slow, or too fast to keep the needle in the blue at all times. My kids seem to think it's fun, so that's all that matters. But if you're an adult or an older child, I think you might get bored. Just pumping and watching the car go round and round. All the hardware is top notch.

My kids have watched with me YT videos of the $3000 Aibo dog. They were not fooled by this dog. LOL!<br /><br />Regardless, this is a well made toy. The weakest feature is the voice command. It doesn't work all the time. It comes with 2 rechargeable batteries for the dog, which is great since you can always have one back-up ready to go. The remote takes two triple AAA batteries. This dog is basically room decor for my daughter, she thinks its cute, but she doesn't really play with it.

Honestly, the end result of this project has been more satisfying than any other stuff I've put together with my 8 yr old. We've built plenty of Lego stuff together, but we never admired the end product as much as we've admired this cyborg hand. It's also a conversation piece. I don't understand some of the complaints. The only way this hand doesn't work is if you messed up, plain and simple. Because really, there is a lot of opportunity for user error. It could be a little mentally draining to follow the instructions, so you need to take breaks if you're not good at focusing. Another tip I have is that you'll need to replenish the water in the pistons from time to time. It will evaporate, and without water the fingers won't bend as much, thus, less gripping power.<br /><br />-The yellow knob on top of the hand raises or lowers the 3 middle fingers, equivalent to opening or closing the palm of your hands.<br />-Two red gears allow for the outer fingers to spread.<br />-Thumb gear allows for it to pivot up and down.<br />-The pistons control the bending of the fingers, essentially the knuckles.<br /><br />Watch my video. I demonstrate all the articulation points. This is an enthusiastic 5 stars!",

I can envision getting more into it if opponents were more skilled and can block every shot you take. Blocking the marbles from going into your goal is actually the fun part. So in essence, the fun part about this game is the DEFENSE. The offense isn't that fun when you keep scoring and your opponent is not good at blocking the marbles. The better your opponent's defense, the more appreciative you'll be when you score. Even with skilled players, I'm not sure how fun this actually is. It doesn't seem like it's something you'll bust out in the middle of the week after dinner. As a matter of fact, after playing with it on day 1, it has been in its box.

    "text": "Honestly, I know nothing about Fortnite. All I know is that my son plays it, and these Fortnite sets have made me the coolest dad, at least for the month. This set only has 2 figures, so it's mainly about the two characters and their accessories. Initially, I wondered is this like opening up blind packs? Hence, the vending machine theme? But it's not like that at all. All the packs inside are building materials, so you cannot hand them out like blind assortments. Once you put the cube together, it is gigantic! To truly get an idea what this is all about, I recommend searching Fortnite Vending Machine on YT to see more experience gamers unbox and talk about this set.",

    "text": "There are so many RC toys on Amazon that does some amazing things that do not cost $50. Right off the bat, I'm knocking 1 star for the price. The pranks get old really quick because there aren't many.<br /><br />1. Squirt water at someone.<br />2. Punch someone.<br />3. The sound effects button that will cycle through certain noises like passing gas, flushing toilet, breaking glass, etc.<br />4. Using the Robot as a MIC to sneak up and talk/scream at people.<br /><br />Essentially, it's just an RC robot that makes funny sounds. The wheels are puny, and so going on carpet is a no-no, so I'll knock a star for that as well. The more I thought about this toy, I wondered.. \"Are we teaching kids to be obnoxious?\" Something to think about before you make this purchase.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:bf81b2040c0e95f289d3f47568c3d256]] This is pretty much a Lego-like set. The pieces are compatible with your standard Legos. So you can add more to him and modify your robot if you wish. It also promotes parent/children bonding time. I put this robot together with my 8 yr old kid. You can control it with the physical remote, or by an app via bluetooth. There is so much more to do with the app, such as coding it's path then hit the button to see the results, controlling via gyro, and voice. However, the VOICE hasn't been working for us. It worked on the first day we put it together, then a week later, it didn't work. I'm not surprised, products that depend on apps can be rendered useless if your phone has an update that it doesn't like. My phone is the Oneplus 5th. So for the app to always be working in tip top condition, you would need this company to be on top of its game with all the phones on the market. LOL! I don't expect that. I expect functions to be broken sooner or later because of lack of up-keep, especially from unknown brands that are white label products. I've seen this robot sold under different brands, so this is for sure a white label item from China. So don't ever lose your physical remote. One important tip I do have.. once you're connected by the phone, your physical remote won't work anymore, and simply disconnecting from the app won't work. To get the robot and remote to respond to each other again, you need to disconnect from app, turn off your robot, and also be sure your physical remote is turned off too. Then turn on your robot again, and turn on your physical remote again. Now they will be paired again. I'll give this 4 stars.",

    "text": "This is basically a refresh or update on older Osmo products. The Tangrams, letters and numbers have been offered before in a different type of packaging. Check out my photos for the \"Old packaging.\" But we really like these new Tupperware type cases.  They stack and take up less space. The old ones stack too via magnets, but as you can see in the picture, the boxes were much bigger. Your children are in for a treat if this is your first Osmo kit. Be sure to get the Creativity kit too, so you can play the Monster game. IMO, Monster is the best of all their offerings. You'll need a dry erase board for that game.<br /><br />As with all our Osmo reviews, we make sure to emphasize this point... How much your children get out of it depends on if you have case for your Fire tablet and how hard it is to remove that case. No case, or an easy to remove case means you will play it a lot. A hard to remove case is a deterrent that will make you not play it as much. Simple as that.  I recommend getting an easy to remove case and let your children play Osmo as often as possible. 5-stars!",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:70401b9086e08489b8471006d9a7ceb7]] March 2, 2021 UPDATE:<br />--------------------------<br />This was adult owned and taken care of. Mainly used for display, and sparingly demo'ed in the 6 months that I've owned it. I hadn't turned it on for a long while, probably several months. I decided to test it out again, and it wouldn't turn on. I've charged it for over 5 hours. There is a red light to indicate it's charging, but still won't turn on. No longevity for this item. Reducing review to 1-star.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />------------------<br />Very fun light saber! Has a good heft to it and feels high quality. The handle is some sort of aluminum or metal. This looks much better than those plasticky toys. But as usual, with all these sabers on the market, the worst looking part is the the plastic tube. Our tech isn't there yet, but hopefully one day, we can get rid of that plastic tube and have a real solid light beam out! In any case, here are the controls:<br /><br />-Single click button once to turn on.<br />-Single click button again to hear effect.<br />-While it's on, Double click for a blasting sound which the manual calls \"lockup mode.\" It will stay at this sound until you Double Click again to get out of it.<br />-While it's on, triple click to change colors (this is finicky though)<br />-Press & hold button to turn off.<br />-To change the sound \"theme,\" while it's off, hold the button, you will hear a sound theme. Hold the button again to hear the next sound theme, hold it again to hear the next, etc. There is a total of 4 themes, one of which is actually mute.<br />-To use any of these themes, once you like what you hear, just single click the button to turn on and play. Remember clicking once turns it on, but holding the button would cause it to cycle through the themes. But once on, to get back to cycling through the themes, you need to press & hold to turn off first, then press & hold to cycle through the themes.<br /><br />My kids have a few sabers from the out of business toy store. This one belongs to daddy. LOL! I'm knocking 1 star for the finicky controls and instructions that were a little hard to figure out. 4 stars.",

Due to distance learning with the kids, I haven't had time to go through these projects with my kids, but we opened it up to check it out and it is awesome! This is the very definition of INTERACTIVE. There are two main visual experiences:<br /><br />1. Images will pop out of the book on your phone when you aim it at the book. The app that you use, called VR Universe, is in some way \"connected\" to the book. It's like scanning a barcode. So when you place your camera to scan a page, the magic happens. I recorded my screen to show you exactly what I'm talking about, so watch the video! I grew up with Viewmasters in the 1980's. My mind would have been blown away had something like this existed back then.<br /><br />2. It will instruct you to put on the provided VR Goggles to view educational virtual reality videos.<br /><br />For #2, I don't like removing my case from my phone, so there is a way for you to adjust the VR google so that it will accommodate thicker phones, or phone with case. It's as simple as removing a few screws, just look at my pictures. On top of the visual experiences are the awesome science projects that your kids can complete. 5-stars!",

Shoot it a few times, he roars, lights up and is angry, shoot it a few more times and his hands droop, shoot one last time and he falls down. My kids love it, and we like to demonstrate it when their friends come over. Great RC toy, especially for dinosaur enthusiasts.",

I think it would look real good next to a Leprechaun doll in your display or something. But I digress, we got these coins to use as a reward system for our children. Do something good, chore, etc., and receive a gold coin. Collect 10 coins and you can trade them in for a prize. Each coin is about .2 oz, and the whole bag weighs about 1 lb 5 oz. They feel great in the hands, especially when you're holding the whole bag. You can really feel the weight and quality. 5 stars.",

So just download the following apps individually:<br /><br />Coding Awbie<br />Coding Jam<br />Coding Duo<br /><br />Games are fun and my kids enjoy it, but in my experience with Osmo games, the one thing that will deter you from playing it as much as you should is the type of case you have. If you have a case that makes it a hassle to remove your tablet, then won't play it as much. Simple as that. So if you want to get the most out of Osmo, put your tablet in an easy to remove case.

You should also know that any dry erase board will work. You can buy the biggest board you can find at an office store, and put this Osmo base on it and it will work.<br /><br />As I've mentioned in my other Osmo reviews, what type of case you have for your iPad will determine how often you play Osmo games. Some of us have very rugged kid cases for our children that are hard to remove. We have those colorful big rubber rugged cases for our kids and it is a chore to remove, put back, remove, put back.

I have a 5 yr old and this barely interested her, but that's my fault. She lives in a house full of tech, gadgets and toys. Here's the main problem in a nutshell, I tell my daughter, \"If you do this, this and that, mTiny will go here, here and there.\" She essentially says, \"But if we get rid of the props, I can control her to anywhere in the house.\" mTiny basically is an RC toy. Take any RC toy, If you push this on the remote, the car goes there. Isn't that, in essence, computational thinking too?<br /><br />So far she's not that into it, but I'll continue to try and I'll update this review if we have a breakthrough. But she's always been a little too clever for her age. When she was 2.5 yrs, during one dinner night, she asked for some juice while I just closed the fridge with items in both my hands. I don't want her to have too much juice either, so I said, \"I can't right now, I don't have any hands.\" She said if I put down one of the items on the counter next to me, then I'll have a free hand.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the pieces in this set are just as heavy, if not heavier. For example, there is a listing for a metal set that cost $65 alone with no board. The King in that set is 3 inches tall, but only weighs 1.3 oz. The King in this set is only 2.75 inches tall, but weighs 1.7 oz.

    "text": "A Netflix documentary on speed cubers made me order this. LOL!  I always wondered how these cubers can twist the cube so fast, even more perplexing is when they do it with one hand... well now I know. The last time I owned a rubik's cube was sometime in the 80's. The cubes we grew up were rigid or tight. The cubes that are used in tournaments can twist and turn buttery smooth, just like the cubes in this listing. Very smooth, and you can twist them easily with one hand too.. so here's a thought.. why not use it as a fidget gadget too? Lastly, since they are sticker-less, these will age better. They won't look ugly like your old peeling Rubik's cube from the past.",

    "title": "From a Miko vs Vector perspective...",
    "text": "[[VIDEOID:806ce296931b008ec9e325daf5456c6e]] We are owners of a Vector robot by Anki, so we can provide a little perspective. I think you have to at least own one robot in a similar price range to know what is reasonable expectation. If Miko is your first robot, your expectations might be too low or too high. So I think I can give you a balance opinion.<br /><br />Artificial Intelligence...  Vector wins.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Vector is like Pinocchio trying to be a real boy. Miko is a smart device that moves on command. Imagine if Alexa, Siri or Google was given a Robot body in the shape of an egg, that's Miko! If you're looking for a robot that's more independent and feels more real, Vector is what you want. Vector truly feels like a pet with the convenience of never having to feed it or take it for a walk. LOL! When you physically touch or nudge Vector, it reacts. If you tap the floor in front of him, his eyes will look down, if you waive your hand over his head, his head will look up. You can tell it gets excited to see you. It is happy when you stroke it, and gets mad when you lift him in the air for too long. Miko is not like that, nor does Miko move around autonomously like Vector. You have to to initiate \"AUTOPILOT\" in order for Miko to move around herself. And when she's on autopilot, some default music is playing, basically the theme music you hear in their Miko ads. When she bumps into something, she has a few phrases, one of which is \"Not again!\" But it all feels programmed, it does not feel like a pet roaming around with independent thinking. It can bump into the same spot over and over. Whereas with Vector, when you put him in a new environment, he will scan the room, and take 360 degree snapshots of his environment so he can roam around more intelligently.  When you interrupt him, he'll react, when you pick him up, he gets mad, he wants you to put him down. When you interrupt Miko on Autopilot, nothing happens. You can put your hands in front of her, and she'll move in another direction because of her sensors, but that's about it. If you use the wake word, \"Hello Miko,\" she will respond, but she will no longer be on autopilot, and you'll need to manually start it again. They should at least put an update where you can tell Miko to go on autopilot using voice. It's basically like a Roomba that you set on autopilot. Vector feels like a living thing because you can interrupt him, and interact with him, then when you leave him alone, he goes about his business moving around again. You can tell Vector to come to you, and he will like a real pet. Miko does not come to you like that. She may move forward, but she does not come to your direction. Vector knows where the direction of the command is coming from and he will move towards that direction. You can make a loud banging noise and Vector will react like a nosy human, his head will move as if asking, \"What was that noise?\" Meanwhile, Miko will stand motionless, there is no reaction to the environment.  When Vector's battery is drained, he knows how to find his charging dock and dock himself. Meaning you could be away for awhile, come back and find Vector on his charging dock, but that doesn't mean he hasn't been snooping around. LOL! With Miko, there is no charging dock. She'll let you know she needs more juice, and you'll have to charge her. Lastly, as is, Miko only recognizes one face, whereas Vector can recognize multiple faces and call your correct name. I think Miko actually doesn't even recognize any faces, for that matter. This is how I know...  When you introduce yourself and tell her your name, JACK, you become the default profile. Then when you ask Miko \"who am I,\" she'll say JACK correctly. Now if you have someone else introduce herself as JILL, she now becomes the new default. So if Jack comes back and ask, \"Who am I?\" Miko will say JILL. She basically just calls you by the name of the last person introduced. So currently, there is no intelligent facial recognition like Vector.<br /><br />Which one has more games and learning apps? Miko wins.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I guess this would be the bread and butter of Miko. Vector has a tiny interface to show his facial emotions and a few games like black jack, but there's not a lot to do with Vector in terms of apps. He is not app-centric, Miko is app-centric.  Both robots have the usual general knowledge AI. You can ask both robots questions like who's the president, what time is it, math, definitions, etc. Basically all the types of general knowledge you would ask Alexa, Siri or Hey Google. But on top of the general knowledge, Miko has a big colorful screen with lots of learning apps. The games will require the child to interact and press buttons to give or to get answers. This is the main advantage Miko has over Vectors. So that's why I say Miko feels like a tablet that moves on command. I guess the plan is for Miko to continue to develop and add to their app store, which is called the TALENT HOUSE. I've seen a coding app that they are asking $30 for. But most apps are free. This would be equivalent to the Skills section of the Alexa app. The more you add, the more things your Miko will do. Again, you want Vector if you want something that feels more life like, something to play with. He has a cube that he likes to play with, so you can ask him to flip his cube, pick up his cube, etc. Like a dog with tricks.  Miko has no moving arms, and does not interact physically with you.<br /><br />Miko has a neat Video calling feature.<br />--------------------------------------------<br />Because it has the advantage of the big screen, one neat feature of the Miko is that you can call it from your smartphone, but within the Miko app. I assume this will work from anywhere. It's basically wifi calling with video. So you'll be able to see your kids when they answer, and they'll be able to see you. Can't do that with Vector! You can also move Miko during this video call using directional buttons in the app.<br /><br />Wake word.. Miko wins.<br />---------------------------<br />How is this even a category for competition? LOL! But you see, with Vector, the wake word is  \"Hey Vector,\" but you have to wait for him to turn blue, then you have to say \"I have a question..\" Then wait for Vector to say, \"Ready!\" Then you can ask your question. This is probably the #1 complaint of Vector. It doesn't feel like a natural conversation like it does with Alexa, Siri or Google. Miko wins here because asking her general questions is just like Alexa. You say, \"Hello Miko,\" when she turns green, you proceed with your question. Not convoluted like Vector. I will say this.. Vector has Alexa built in. So you can actually bypass Vector for general knowledge and just say, \"Alexa!\" This way, you won't need to say \"I have a question.\" But it's just weird to hear Alexa's voice in Vector's body.<br /><br />The VOICE.. Vector wins.<br />----------------------------<br />Vector sounds like a cute robot. Miko sounds like your very dull and boring Auntie. LOL! There are 4 voices to choose from in Miko's app, one of which is a man's voice, but they don't sound all that much better. For such a cute and colorful device, it's strange to have such dull choices for the voices.<br /><br />Availability.. Miko wins.<br />---------------------------<br />Why am I talking so much about Vector, a robot who's creator company Anki, is out of business? LOL! Well, that's because Digital Dreams Lab has continued on with Vector.  They bought the rights, and they were on Kickstarter to provide new life to Vector for a fee, including an escape pod feature that supposedly will allow Vector to be fully functional forever even if Digital Dreams Lab goes out of business. But now, I think Vector cost a little more in the secondary market.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />--------------<br />There is potential here. Ultimately, I might be comparing apples to oranges. I have no idea about what goes on behind the scenes in AI, programming, coding, etc. The path in development for these two could be so different that asking one to be more like the other could be unreasonable. You can't ask Vector to have more apps and games, right? It wasn't develop with a big screen. Likewise, you probably can't ask Miko to be more like vector since it wasn't built with any arms. I would sum it up as Miko being App-Centric, and Vector is Movement-Centric. If you're interested in something more like a smart device/tablet that could move, get Miko. If you're more interested in the physical interaction with a robot, that's more on the side of a real learning AI, then get Vector.<br /><br />Reasonable improvements I'd like Miko to make:<br /><br />-Ability to turn off music in auto pilot.<br />-Ability to turn on apps, including auto pilot by voice.<br />-Ability to turn off apps by voice as well. Right now, if Miko is dancing or playing music, you cannot voice her to stop. You have to grab her and push the stop button.<br /><br />I hope this company sticks around and improves on Miko!",

If you carefully do your research, you can the same 16 inch cheaper on Amazon. So I'm knocking a star for being a little overpriced. Both our kids will start fall with Distance Learning, so I grabbed a few of these knowing they will be useful as electronic scratch pads. Lastly, they are not as bright as the stock photos suggest, even fully charged. But still, it is bright enough to work with. I actually would prefer it if they had just gone with 1 white led color, instead of the rainbow effect because the darker colors don't pop. Not just for children, if you hang this up in your kitchen, it's a notepad for the adults.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:1f9002ea97cd0f2905b85a04900d29a0]] Our kids aren't really into RC vehicles. When I was a kid, I thought they were the coolest things. Sign of the times I guess. Plus, we have a swimming pool, so not much space in the backyard to play rc cars. So when I saw this boat, it was a must try! The packaging, the unknown brand, the Styrofoam, everything was nostalgic. Because it reminded me of those toys you would find at downtown swap-meets, or Chinatown. LOL! But I must say, it works very well. When I want it to turn, it turns, it is very accurate. I like making it go in circles. One last thing I'll mention, there is a clear plastic piece that seemed important because it was in its own little bag. The instructions didn't talk it and for the longest time, I didn't know what it was for. When I went to take pictures for this review, it became obvious... it's a stand for the boat. LOL! I was going to knock a star for pricing, but then I decided to do a little research first, and I realize these things aren't cheap. This is as low as it gets on Amazon for a decent size boat. So I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Regarding accessing the battery...<br />---------------------------------------<br />You might find that the seat cover is too difficult to remove. You'll have to yank it out the first time. But after you do, you can loosen the screw for the black tab to make it easier on you the next time. We've been pulling it several times now, and I can start to see the stress in the plastic. Loosening the screw makes it a lot easier. Look at the last picture.",

    "text": "These are super fun for the kids. Trying to find things for them to do during this social distancing thing. This is a white label product, meaning you will see it offered in different names by different sellers. I was going to buy a set that was about $25 because it had better reviews, but then upon close examination of the stock photos, I realize these are the same guns in different color schemes. It also tried to differentiate itself by using the measurement term OZ instead of CC. There is no rhyme or reason as to why one white label product gets higher reviews than others. It's a psychological herd mentality thing. If a listing gets a lucky good start, people follow. If a listing gets an unlucky bad start, then others will pile on bad reviews, and it stays buried in Amazon's search engine. Don't be fooled by reviews, take your time and look at the photos, and if both companies are unknown brands, then why pay more? It's an entirely different story if one brand is Nerf and one is an unknown, then you know it's a knockoff.  But if both listings are from unknown companies, then the reviews don't matter, just go with the lower price.  My 5 and 7 yr old can use it just fine. The pumping isn't difficult if they just pump a few times. But for a really long-range, you need to pump a lot and the more you pump, the harder it is to pump. So all you Daddys still need to stick around and help them if they want to shoot really far. You're not off the hook. LOL!",

If I were doing a large group using these, I would either pre-cut around the small faces and fold back a bit of the paper to help with peeling off or I'd have scissors out for those helping the kids and give them a heads up about this problem.
