Depending on your planned end purpose for these I would probably back them with a regular canvas for sturdiness. I don't think this would be a really suitable \"toy\" for children unless they are gifted or much older than the 8 years recommended on the box. I say that because the \"paint\" that is included is liquid. There are 5 primary colors  of this liquid paint and a small divided dish to mix the colors in. Unless the parents are mixing this paint, or the child had a great knowledge of art, they are going to mix muddy colors and not be pleased with the results. Some sort of regular dry watercolors that are ready to wet and go would be a much better paint for this kind of kit. I plan to do these with watercolor pencils or Inktense pencils since I am an artist and have those supplies.",

Dumb idea. This product is somewhat complicated to get together. No child I know could use it without complete parental supervision and help.<br /><br />I followed the directions and used a couple of the crayons that were included and a scrap of another Crayola crayon on my work table. I ran 3 heating cycles and the wax still wasn't completely melted. The crayon that I added melted at a different rate than the ones included. After about an hour I was left with a semi melted, muddy mess that when poured into the mold didn't even fill it up.

We opened them and began drawing with them, a child dropped the pen the top came off and the little button batteries went flying.

In my opinion it's a waste of money, and it's kind of annoying. The \"songs\" are terrible. We've had it for a couple of weeks now and she hasn't played with it since the first week. I would give it one star, except she does like it (I guess) and the website description was \"technically\" accurate. Even the little casters on the cats feet are not great. She barely rolls around on them. Battery life is not great either. Honestly, I have no idea how I got duped into buying this expensive noise maker.",

    "text": "These products, both the dry float lounger and the socializer are prime examples of why I test products the way I do prior to writing my review.<br /><br />When I initially received these products and inflated them I was fairly impressed with the design and comfort - by 18 days later both were flat lumps of rubber in the trash.<br /><br />First the socializer never held air.  After inflation by the following morning it had deflated to around 70% capacity. I put it under water in the pool and discovered multiple small defects in 2 seams.<br /><br />The dry float lounger lasted a bit longer at 18 days but then was found flat due to a separation at the seam.<br /><br />It is important to note neither of these were ever used by children or in any rough play as when I review products I adhere to strict guidelines - and there are no children in the home.<br /><br />While the socializer is listed as a dry float it appears the user's calves and feet would be in the water.  The lounger pool float is perfect for those who prefer to float completely out of the water. When floating on this no part of the body is submerged in the water.<br /><br />While 88-90% of the world's population is right handed this manufacturer chose to place the cup holder on the left side and made it too small to hold a standard 12 Oz can for both of these floats.  This is simply poor designing.<br /><br />While these floats come with a small patch kit, these are only helpful when repairing a puncture and absolutely will not hold a torn seam.<br /><br />While these floats appeared to have promise initially, in well under a month they proved to be poorly designed, and of substandard construction and materials.<br /><br />I would not recommend either of these products.",

    "text": "I have used several similar products and this is by far my favorite.<br /><br />As with every product like this I found I wanted to customize it a bit after working with it - that is no big deal.<br /><br />If you prefer a longer string, snip this one and tie another.  The manufacturer recommends Polar Multi-Strand Braided Tip-Up line used for fishing with 40 lbs weight resistance - this can easily be found through fishing retailers.  The 13” included sting is the perfect length for beginners.  This length will allow for great control and keeping the wand relatively close to the performer will help prevent accidents.<br /><br />The wand itself is incredibly well made with a plethora of color and pattern options.  Everything is controlled via a single button which I've found easy and intuitive to understand and use.<br /><br />This wand is powered by an internal, USB charged battery (USB 2.0 to Micro cable is included).  The battery lasts an incredibly long time - the amount of time is dependent on the level of the luminosity selected and the mode (the brighter the light the less time the battery will last).  Once the battery is completely drained it will require 5-6 hours to completely recharge.<br /><br />Counterbalance is achieved by utilizing the 3 stainless steel washers that are included.  Due to the wand containing LED lights at the end washers are needed as the open center allows light to pass through.  If you feel the three washers extend the cap too far use a slightly larger, or thicker washer.  I have tried multiple configurations of the counterbalance weights and this will all depend on personal preference.<br /><br />A bit of advice - put a couple drops of superglue between the washers to keep them from moving as the wand is spun - this helps with consistent balance and the washers will not clink together.<br /><br />The reason the cap comes loose is the force of the counterweights pressing against it - gluing them together helps. In addition I added a couple of rubber bands (from my son's braces - so tiny) to the end of the wand with the counterweights. This gives the silicone cap the perfect traction so it never slips free.<br /><br />I have used this wand at music festivals, drum circles and for photography light painting.  It is really a phenomenal product and while there are cheaper ones on the market, you get what you pay for...<br /><br />An phenomenal thing to know about EmazingLights is their level of customer support.  In researching this product I reached out to their technical support team for a bit of additional information and they were helpful in addition to having an excellent website.  This product, like all EmazingLights products, comes with a LIFETIME GUARANTEE!  I verified that this warranty includes the recharging battery. If it should ever stop holding a charge all you have to do is contact them and they will replace your wand.  You simply can not find a better warranty than that on any similar product from any company.<br /><br />If you are looking for an awesome LED light wand that is easy to learn with, fun to use and will hold up for years of fun - this is the product to buy.  EmazingLights not only has developed and made an incredible product but they stand behind it.<br /><br />I've absolutely loved mine and know several people who have purchased identical models after taking a twirl with my magic wand.",

    "title": "AWESOME GAME for the WHOLE FAMILY!",
    "text": "While many games make the claim that they are suitable for the whole family - this one is actually FUN for the whole family!<br /><br />As most are familiar with the game Jenga, this is essentially played the same way - pull a block from the stack and place it on top.  If your block causes the tower to tumble, you lose.  The primary difference is the blocks are SUPERSIZED, measuring 7.1”(long) X 2.3”(wide) X 1.4”(tall).  The blocks are the perfect size for little hands and kids get the hang of the game quickly and enjoy seeing the tower grow and eventually topple.<br /><br />While the game's tower begins at around 2' it quickly grows to 4-5'+.  The blocks are not only bigger but they are made of high grade pine, sanded smooth - 20 of the blocks are numbered (1-8, some numbers are duplicated while others are not) allowing players to develop a limitless number of custom games.  Something we do is let the winner of each game write their name, or a short message on a block - it makes it fun to look back and remember the fun we have had during previews games.<br /><br />In addition to the blocks this set comes complete with a wooden crate for storage and travel that easily doubles as a stable, flat playing surface when needed.  In addition there is a white board with a dry erase marker for listing the rules you've set for the numbered blocks.  Due to the 8 block being a one of a kind, we call it the Magic 8 Block and use that as a wild card type block - the person who pulls and places it can name whatever rule they choose.<br /><br />This is a game reminiscent of games of old - no batteries, nothing electronic, it will last forever, can go anywhere to be played inside or out and is loads of fun for everyone.<br /><br />This is most definitely a game set I recommend. We have loved it!",

As a retired occupational therapist and one who used similar toys with patients, I can attest that they promote a relaxation response as they encourage repetition, are tacitile thus reducing tactile defensiveness, and allow children to fiddle with an object that feels spongy  which at the same time encourages attention.  A great idea for all children to have not only children who have learning deficits or attentional issues.<br />C Stephan",

There were no directions with the gloves but it is pretty easy to figure out how to use.  You press the button on the back side of the glove to light up.  It really looks like a skeleton.  The challenging part is that it takes a longer time to turn the battery off.  Without instructions one has to fiddle with the button.  The gloves also come with 4 extra flat nickel batteries which is great.  My grandson really likes these gloves when bike riding in the early evening.  C Stephan",

    "text": "Just came into a new relationship, We have a child age 3,  who can't not pronounce words at all.  Most 90% words all sound the same. So the idea hit me to start teaching sign language.  So I bought these cards to teach me and him how to talk to one another.  There is a learning curve in figuring out the right ways to move hands for newbies.  And can be difficult to get a 3 yrnold attention long enough to learn the signs but the cards are great.  Money well spent.  I'm happy over all with my purchases and hope this can help someone else in same situation.<br />All we can do at this point is try.  What do we have to loose<br /><br />I have NOT been paid for this review nor any other review so far. (I wish I would though).<br />This is, as always, just and only my opinion thought my own eyes and felt with my own hands.  I take reviews serious, as I rely on them to make my decisions before any and all my purchases. So if you have found my review helpful please vote and let the other Amazonian Browsers get a better judgment of what to expect and how the product works.  Thank you for your time and happy buying.",

You have options of attaching the cup floater on either side AND it holds a cell phone perfectly.  My wife loves it and wants another.<br /><br />Downside:  it didnt come with any patch repair at all.  I am confident (because of thickness) that the reason for no patch is, you wont be needing one.  The float is made in a way that it seems would be difficult to punch a hole.  But still would make me feel a whole lot better to included a patch considering its 40$ + for the float.",

It was very easy for her to learn how to use and charge it on her own. This is a great camera to teach kids about photography. The camera quality itself is poor, I attached an image taken off the camera. It reminds me of a cell phone camera from 10-15 years ago. It's fine for younger kids who don't care but if you have an older child I would suggest getting them a cheap mirrorless DSLR or just a recent phone which will give the ability to take better quality photos.",

    "text": "This hatchimal is huge! The crystal home for her is much larger than I expected. It looks really pretty in the crystal container.<br /><br />When I opened it up 4 of us had a hard time reading the instructions and figuring out how to plug her in to start charging (the charge port is located on her skirt...not the base of the crystal structure). I don't like that she has a stand on the base of the crystal for charging but you can't put the lid on at the same time or it cuts the charge cord. Would have been a nice design detail if there was a hole at the bottom of the top part of the crystal that would fit the cable so I dont have this extra part of the toy sitting around.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch on her skirt. Once she is turned on you hold her in your hand and she is supposed to start flying. I have issues getting her to start sometimes and have to move my hand underneath the skirt a few times for her to recognize it and start flying. I don't recommend her for indoor use, seems much better and can get a lot more fly time outside in a park than indoors where she will quickly hit a wall or furniture and stop flying. After I pick her up, she will not fly for me again without turning her on and off again. It does hurt to stop her in the air by using your hands. One time this flew into my daughters head and caused a bruise, the wings are hard and hurt more than you would expect.<br /><br />The next day we tried to use her again but the little bars around her skirt now hit her arms for some reason and stop flying. Nothing happened to her in between us using her the day before. I would have been frustrated if I purchased this toy for $30 to only get one day of use out of it.<br /><br />Overall my daughter loves this toy and her crystal house and had a lot of fun on the first day of play, the second day of play she was really sad and frustrated that she couldn't get her to fly properly again.  Honestly, the coolest thing about this toy is the packaging, My children played for them for maybe two days before losing interest.",

If my daughter walks through one of the curtains it almost looks like it might fall over. I put this in my kid's room with some pillows inside and they love to go in there and draw pictures. It's a good pop up castle for the price, extremely easy to assemble and the kids have a blast in it. It would be good for birthday parties or just playing around. I'm not expecting it to last a long time with how rough my kids are together but I think they will enjoy it while it lasts!",

The other brush is to be used dry for glitter, for glitter you paint the glue where you want it then kind of tap the glitter onto it with the brush. We have great results.

    "text": "Update:<br />Changing my review from 5 to 3 stars due to the brittleness of the plastic poles. After two nights of having it set up, my small cat jumped on the roof of it and snapped one pole that we used duct tape to fix. The next day one of the kids fell over in it and snapped one of the poles and bent three more. She's only 29 pounds and it really took nothing to break the poles. They were very upset because we had to end up throwing this out since we could not fix it and they really loved it.<br /><br />This is very easy to assemble, took about 7 mins. It comes in a storage bag, there are plastic poles that hold this castle up from the inside you have to put together. Easily fits my two daughters, I think it could fit three kids if needed. Great for play and dress up! We set this up as soon as it arrived and my kids went crazy. They loved it.<br /><br />Negative is that the teeth of the velcro are sewn to the inside of the roof so when you pull the roof hole open, the velcro left on the roof gets stuck to my kid's hair and pulls it.",

The star erases the tablet and the moon locks it so it can't erase. The tip of the stylus was a little jagged and ended up making a permanent small scratch on the screen when I gave it to my 3.5 year old daughter.

My son immediately wanted to sit on this thing which of course it is not intended for. If that happens, poor plastic horsey will no doubt have an immediate amputation. I wish this toy was heavier and better made. As it sits, it has only been a few days since the horse was made a member of our family, and his hair already looks ratted and tangled and he has a few trails on his body where the felt he is covered in has been damaged.

The screen graphics are in color and although they are at times a bit pixelated and chunky, you can tell what you are looking at well enough. I love that they are loud enough for the child to hear even when there are distractions going on in the house. The other thing that is great about this machine is that, after the child gets used to a certain level and completes the activity, it re-calibrates to another level to make the activity more difficult. I think this is a wonderful product for kids that has the potential to teach them a lot of important skills for phonics, math and language arts.

They replaced a tiny part that I lost which was my own fault (some parts are extremely small so you need to handle it with care and make sure no kids are around. Keep the figure in a place where kids cannot reach or you WILL lose parts--guaranteed).<br /><br />If you're a geek who loves Zelda, you still haven't grown up like me, and you still like toys (&#34;No sir, I did not see you playing with your dolls again&#34; --name that movie), then you need this Link toy.

    "text": "My entire family has played this game several times now. It's really fun and the concept is super simple. My youngest is 6 and has only a tiny bit of a handicap while playing. She sits next to me so I can read her card or provide any needed help. The basic premise of game is, you have a time limit to name off items on playing cards you draw. If you successfully name off all the items on the playing card you draw, you keep that card. 1st player to have 10 cards wins. So for example, in the picture with my review is a card that says \"braided items\". You read that as someone slaps the timer (there is an urgent ticking sound coming from timer!!!) After naming 3 braided items, you use the spinner to see what you need to do next. You may land on a 2 or 3. In which case you need to list 2 or 3 more braided items. You might land on next card, in which case you select another card and try to name those items off before the buzzer beeps, or you might land on next player. Then, the whole thing starts over again. The only thing wrong with the game is that the on/off button is on the bottom of buzzer. So, it you spin and land on 'next player' you need to manually flip the buzzer over, and turn it off, then on again. That's a massive pain and when you're playing with 11 year olds,  everyone has grabby hands.",

    "text": "What an outstanding toy for a dinosaur lover! There is so much attention to detail and so many different components to this set! Front and center of course, is the 12\" T-Rex. His legs and arms move. So does his mouth. He roars and his tongue and eyes light up. There is a lever on his tummy that opens and closes his mouth.  Next, there is a 15\" volcano/slide/prison!! With lava!!! AWESOME! The volcano comes with a big bolder ala Indiana Jones. Also looks like a small plastic \"rope\" ladder can hook on the back of volcano for ready escape! The prison has a battered door AND  a \"secret\" exit made of massive dinosaur teeth and a \"hidden\" lever that raises them.  Included also are 2 small dinos and a rather large egg. Lastly,  there is a very brave, rugged 3\" action figure wearing khakis and a hat. He drives a Jeep renegade (the wheels spin) which is ALSO included. Apparently he likes fire because he has a torch and a bonfire to keep those pesky dinosaurs at bay. Oh yes, he also has a teeny ax. I bet that's to chop all the wood he needs for his fires.<br />MY SON LOVES THIS SET! He's 10 and has been obsessed with dinosaurs since in utero.",

One of the reasons was because everything was basically in this kit and I didn't have to run all around the store getting individual components. Also, the \"magic liquid\" is premixed so there's no powder to spill anywhere. Basically, you add 1 bottle (2.3 oz) of \"magic liquid\" a teaspoon at a time to the entire bottle (5oz) of glue. But not just any glue will do! Glow in the dark glue!!! And it really does glow. The slime is the right consistency. Not too liquidy. There is no included container to store your slime in sadly. My colors were a pink and a yellow,  both with sparkles. I don't know if all the kits have those same colors. Everything is neatly and securely packed in the box. Also, Elmer's gives a website name for more slime recipes.",

There is also no on/off switch so you are forced (Lord help us all) to listen to the baby shark song sing-over and over and over and over and... yes. Good times. Eventually, we took the battery pack out and now we just have a quiet puppet.<br />The cool thing about this puppet is that the song (when battery installed) automatically speeds up and slows down according to how fast you move your hand. The kids got a huge kick out of that. We did not need to install a battery, it was included. We just had to peel off a plastic tab to activate the song. The puppet is sewn extremely well. After hours of being tossed around and having my dog slobber on him once or twice, he's no worse for the wear. I also like his bright color.",

If you touch the bakugans tummy to the magnet, they open. The theory being, if you drop the bakugan onto the disc perfectly, they open. They also open and close manually. On the actual creatures, there are no removable parts. They are a little like a cross between a transformer and a pokemon ball. He said he liked being able to fold them up again and again.

He loved it!! It took him about 30 minutes to assemble. We all gathered around him ad he turned it on. Suddenly, music was playing in our house! We all cheered and had a fun afternoon listening to it. My son said that the wires connecting to the speakers can break off, so be a little gentle when using this part. This unit is not durable, it is made from thin cardboard, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. If you baby it, it might last 3 or 4 days. Ours broke already because, you know, 10 y.o. boy.

    "text": "Update: It's July & this giant ball was a huge hit at our pool party. It's so big that it is nearly impossible for one person to pick it up without getting under it. It's so heavy it mowed down chairs & tiki torches when it got knocked out of the pool. It spent a fair amount of time in the bushes with no punctures or leaks.<br /><br />This ball is huge. It isn't quite 6', more like 5'. I would love to tell you that it is so much fun in the pool or at the beach but it's December & our beach plans are on hold because it's also 2020. We blew it up though & it's already a lot of fun due to its comically large size. It's so big that we couldn't get our arms around it so it might be tough to handle.<br />The ball is so huge that it took 20 minutes or so fill with an electric pump. I started to fill this ball in the house but the PVC smell was overwhelming so we moved it to my workshop where the smell is still overwhelming. I highly suggest inflating this outside.<br />The material it is made of is thick & seems tough & we dragged it through doorways & set it on the ground without worry. It has a 1\" opening for filling or deflating & another 3/4\" or so valve inside that which includes a check valve for final inflating. I used the 1\" valve to fill it until it was nearly full, then the 3/4\" to top it off. When it was time to put it away I used the 1\" valve to deflate the ball & even to suck air out with the pump.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:3bd077e56d6c98a9858470ee43cf995]] This figure looks great, is very faithful to the movie & is very pose-able with 20 points of articulation. With the motorcycle it offers a lot of play-ability. The figure fits the bike very well & can be posed in many ways on the bike. There are several pegs on the bike that fit into holes in Duke's boots to make him at least look balanced. Duke's helmet doesn't come off.<br />The stunt cycle's performance is also faithful to the movie which is unfortunate. The launcher is more of a gimmick & isn't necessary to use the toy. All of the cycle's motivation comes from winding a spring inside the bike by rolling it backwards.  It's actually hard to put the bike in the launcher after it is wound without releasing the stored energy.<br />The motorcycle isn't quite as detailed or faithful to the movie but it looks great & it can take a beating without breaking. The cycle also has an extendable stand & set of dolly wheels that allows it to emulate a wheel stand while either rolling or just posing.<br />I wasn't able to get this to any kids before the review but I think it will be fun as a standalone or addition to other Toy Story character dolls. I can't think of any other full size dolls from the franchise that come with a vehicle.",

It's kind of like doing a puzzle but with less frustration because instructions. It's also somewhat therapeutic for me to have a project that has instructions, an actual end & no due date.<br /><br />We didn't know what or where Trafalgar Square is (or was) prior to receiving this set. There is a nice history lesson at the beginning of the instructions & it inspired us to do some more research & look at pictures to see how accurately the model portrays it.<br /><br />This is our first Architecture set. It is smaller than the sets we have done in the past but it has many, many pieces & some very clever uses of the parts. Some of the pieces are captured rather than snapped together & parts are used just for their edges & unusual features to make steps & windows & such. Some of the assemblies are deliciously tedious & the result is a very good representation.<br /><br />The parts & instructions are typical, high LEGO quality. The bags are numbered to match the build stages & the box is close-able & high quality. I definitely want to get more of these sets because of the historical interest, the build experience & the nice display piece that results. I do wish that the box was shaped so that it could hold the model or at least the footprint during the build, it wouldn't take much more space.",

But my 6-month-old grandbaby LOVED it. She was fascinated by the lights, and the ears were just the right size for her little fists to grab onto. I think the age thing is a bit off. The toy isn't built for a 6-month-old to really enjoy playing if the baby can't sit up because there's nothing sturdy to hold on to. The older kids weren't intrigued because the music didn't last but about 30 seconds for some and maybe a minute for other songs. I was so very glad it had a volume control. Maybe there was just too much going on at the time.<br /><br />I'm taking it to my daughter's house so maybe in a quieter environment the kids can enjoy it better.

But this set doesn't live up to their brand name.<br />I actually came back to the listing to see if I was perhaps doing it wrong, hoping to find a video showing how it works. After all, it seems to have glowing reviews.<br />Interestingly, there's no video on the listing, and not a single user review video either. In fact, it seems like a lot of the positive feedback for this product comes from people who may not have ever opened and tried the product! Well, we tried it. And it doesn't work. While the monster truck is a cool addition to our toys, the set doesn't actually perform the stunt as described. Granted the instructions aren't good, but we tried multiple times and multiple ways. My kids got frustrated and gave up, I couldn't get it to work either. The fact that I can't even find a single video of it working is sort of telling. Maybe it's good as part of the interlocking set of all the monster truck stunts that they advertise, but on its own I have to say I'm disappointed.",

    "text": "I've got kids and we all love fidget toys. This is kind of an interesting concept for me, there's a couple of axis suspended inside of a half sphere and each can spin on its own direction. This makes for some pretty interesting movements, as you can technically spin one to sort of bleed the inertia off a different one and see the patterns of lines intersect each other. It's hard to explain, but kind of interesting to play with, as it makes you think a little bit about how spinning in one direction will effect spinning in the other.<br />It's made of plastic, doesn't seem particularly strong but not flimsy either. It's an interesting take on the fidget toy concept for someone who wants to try something new.<br />The only reason I'm removing a star is the description calls it a gyroscope. I actually LOVE gyroscopes because they teach about the balancing effects of centripetal forces. You don't really get that here, there isn't much to learn about forces and balance, I kind of wish it had that added perk. I was excited to try it but found it more like a traditional fidget spinning toy.",

As far as the performance goes, the cube takes a bit of time to break in but after 5-10 solves the cube is good to go. What I like about the v3 compared to other cubes such as the Gan 12 is that it has an outer coating that makes it rarely slip even with sweaty hands.

You creatively place clamps around a play area to run a string, then set the timer \"bomb\" and have a certain amount of time to collect the cards and disable the bomb before it explodes.<br />Every time a string is accidentally moved, the timer loses time and beeps faster.<br />It's not so easy to get the trigger working properly at first, but after an evening of playing with it, we were able to get it set properly. It relies on a plastic tab blocking an LED sensor that moves when the string is pulled, and if the tab isn't placed exactly in the right position, the whole thing doesn't really work. I feel like it could be designed better to make that less tricky, but I'd imagine the game would cost more to produce.<br />An extra trick to make it more challenging: Have someone call out the cards in a particular order for the player to collect. This means the player might have to turn around and go back the way they came sometimes. Much more fun this way rather than just grabbing all the cards at once.

In other words, you don't get precise left/right movement, you can only go straight, or curve as you back up. I remember having plenty of RC cars like that when I was a kid, and its interesting to see my little guy figure out how to maneuver using those controls now. It's also got some pretty sweet LED lights on the bottom that not only look cool, but also remind you that you left the car on when finished playing.<br />The only problem, however, is the build quality of the car. My son thought it was broken the day after we got it because it would not respond to button presses anymore. Turns out one of the wheels got pinched by the body of the car and would refuse to turn. I had to pop the back out of the frame (basically removing the shell of the car) to get it to work again, and it was really difficult to get it to snap back in without breaking.<br />I managed to do it, but I feel like it's only a matter of time before it gets pinched and stuck again, and I wonder how many times I can do this before the plastic tab snaps off.

Yes, a little.<br />While there are plenty of pros here, the bodies are really detailed scale models and really cool, there are some cons as well.<br />First of all, the batteries. It uses regular AA batteries in both the remote and the body. Each body needs 3 batteries, and 2 per remote, so that's a grand total of 5 AAs or 10 total needed for this set out of the box. Then there's the fact that the batteries are arranged in a way that is really difficult to reach inside when loading it up. Other RC toys we've played with have a rechargeable pack that MUCH easier to load, reload, charge, etc. This ate through our available supply of Alkaline AAs quickly and I really wish it was rechargeable like other RC toys.<br />But the most annoying part? The TIRES. They keep popping off the rim and then making the cars go slowly. I'll show in the attached video. You have to keep reseating them on the rim to continue playing.

    "text": "My kids have recently shown interest in gems and geology, so they were super excited to try this out! This is a full kit, which means it comes with everything you need: Not only the tumbler parts, but also the various stage mixes and even the raw rocks to use!<br />I actually was hoping it was the sort of thing we could use more than once, learn how to use it with the included stuff and then do more of our own found rocks with the next batch! The thing is, it comes with only enough to do the included rocks, and you have to do them all at once if you want them to come out with the included materials. Beyond that, you can reuse the machine but you have to get more materials to put in with the rocks.<br />The machine also takes a LONG time. I knew tumbling was a process, but it's a few stages and each one takes a few days, so the whole thing took weeks of emptying out and putting in the next stage and setting the timer for the next set of days spinning. The entire process from start to finish was nearly a month. But, my kids loved it and it was a very educational experience. I wish it came with more DIY material, but I guess I'll have to find some more to do our own ones next!",

There's nothing about this game that has anything to do with a cube aside from the puzzle shapes looking reminiscent of the classic cube squares. Really, this is a generic puzzle game in which you race to build a complex shape from a card based on a set of pieces each player has. The pieces are made up of squares that look like a disassembled cube, but it could just as easily be Tetris-branded, Lego branded, or any other shape that one might associate with a popular name. It's a really fun game, my family really enjoys playing it, but my 2 kids who are speed-cube enthusiasts were a little disappointed it wasn't more closely related to the classic puzzle-cube.",

    "text": "I've used a LOT of drones, from professional DJI models to the cheap pocket sized tiny drones. I love flying the little ones around the house and practicing zipping in between banisters and over bookcases, and I love flying my larger DJI Phantoms and Mavic outside for real shots of landscapes and aerial photography. I was hoping this would be a good in-between product.<br />It is not really.<br />It looks a lot like the Mavic Mini, but that immediately falls apart when you hold it and realize how cheap the construction is. That's ok, it costs about 1/3 of what I paid for my Mavic Mini. But I've held cheaper drones that felt better than this. The controls are very much like the cheaper smaller drones that have been around for years (including the flip feature, which is admittedly fun), and the quality of the camera has not improved since the first cheap one I tried 5-6 years ago. Find the most basic/free cell phone you can buy from a store shelf a few years ago and the camera quality will look better than this. That was ok back then, especially since I recall paying 40-60 dollars for those drones and the cheapest DJI was closer to 800! But now, I was expecting better. At this price tag and with 2022 tech, I was hoping it would be some sort of bridge-gap product.<br />The downside to being larger is that it sort of doesn't fit into either category... Unlike a more expensive drone with GPS and fine tuned motors, it does not handle itself well outdoors unless there is ZERO wind (nearly impossible, especially as you climb altitude), and it is too big to fly indoors without being in danger of hitting something and actually doing damage (unlike the smaller cheaper ones). I actually can't think of a situation that I'd like to use this with: I'd recommend a smaller camera drone to play with indoors and once you are approaching the triple digit dollar amount, I'd recommend even a used Mavic Mini for outdoor flying (much more stable with GPS, and a stabilized go-pro quality camera etc).<br />It does come with two batteries which is nice since they go quickly, and the carrying case is pretty nice too. I guess if you're in the market for a drone like this, it DOES work so it deserves at least 3 stars, but I'm slightly disappointed with what you get for the asking price.",

Turns out I had to practically leave it charging overnight, the next day it worked fine again.

The only problem is that the floaties are stuck to the shirt and can't be removed, which means as he's learning to swim and/or if we wants to take a break and take it off, the shirt has to come with it.

Once you've broken it in, it moves much more smoothly and eventually will give you the satisfying feel that an infinity cube is known for.

For a younger kid this is very frustrating, taking my youngest several tries to get right. For an older child it should be fine, but it is not as easy as you would think. Also the on/off button is a touch area that doesn't seem to respond unless you tap it just right. Sometimes a long press does it, sometimes it only responds to a short tap, it seems very unpredictable.<br />It's a cute product, but I have seen similar ones with a switch instead of a touch button, and I would probably recommend one of those instead.

    "text": "I recently got to try out another bounce water slide from this company that was bigger and offered a large slide, however the bounce house part was not large enough if kids just want to jump around.<br />This product is the opposite- the bounce area is nearly double the size, so more kids can jump at a time if they like the trampoline-style part of the toy more. However the slide part is a fraction of the height of the other one, so the slide is not quite as enticing, especially without a pool at the bottom.<br />If you want this one, I would recommend a wading pool or similar that the slide would go into at the bottom, but I can tell you that the taller slide version with a smaller bounce part was the more popular of the two models when we tested them here. It is more expensive as well so keep that in mind- this product is a little cheaper and actually really good if you are more limited in space and want a larger jumping area.<br /><br />It comes with a storage bag and motor with a generous length of power cord. Personally, I found the storage bag to be somewhat silly as there's no way I can get it to fit back in there!",

    "text": "This is a very simple yet very fun game to play with a large family- as long as they don't get too competitive about it. I love that the description cards make for very unexpected combinations that can bring out very creative out-of-the-box thinking interpretations. HOWEVER, this can also be the downside to the game as those interpretations can get pretty vague.<br />What happens in a group of very creative yet very competitive family members, is we begin fighting over what counts or not.<br />For example, if one of the cards says \"can be used for decoration\", and a player demonstrates that a blanket can be used as sash to dress up an outfit, the other players start arguing it doesn't count and we end up submitting to a vote. Of course, the player who voted NO also has a questionable item: \"can be used to write\", brought their little brother who is learning how to write his name and spell simple words. The undeniably funny creative answer is awesome, but then the players can't agree on whether it counts or not. We almost stopped the game after the first few rounds because some of the older players were arguing after EVERY round.<br />Once we all finally agreed to be willing to give up on a contested item (look, you can't fight to get every single card point every single time, the game is boring if we all score all the points on all the rounds!), the game actually got a lot more interesting and fun. If you go into this with an extremely competitive mentality, it will quickly lose its charm as you try to argue every description. However, if you come into this with a healthy dose of humor and creative thinking, and understand that sometimes we'll get a kick out of the answer even if you don't win the point, it's a LOT of fun for the whole family!",

When you are done playing, this thing is HUGE and HEAVY! It's also nearly impossible to get it back into the bag unless you have extreme patience and a lot of strength to keep lifting and folding and shoving. I ended up finding some over sized lawn contractor bags and wrapping it from both sides and storing it in the shed. I'd consider the bag pretty much useless personally, but maybe other people would have more luck. Make sure you have adequate space to store it, it's really quite large!

All you need to do is add some activities (pin the wheel on the truck was a fun one) and food! Oh, and a helium tank. And that's where this product loses a star in my opinion... see, the balloons are something we were excited about, but it turns out there's only one real truck balloon, 2 checkered flag ones (which are theme matching only by proximity to the truck, otherwise they aren't obviously race flags) and then a bunch of just generic balloons with no print at all on them. We bought a helium tank to inflate all of the above, which comes with its own set of balloons. I was a little bit disappointed because this kit says it comes with 18 balloons, but really only 3 are themed (well, really only one, the other two sort of phone it in). The other 15 balloons are just generic colors, much like the kind that comes with the tank anyway. When you see 18 balloons advertised in a themed party kit, you'd at least expect them to have a picture printed on them or something? We didn't even use the other 15 since the ones that come with the tank were plentiful and easier to blow up.<br />It's still a good product and worth the money, but beware that the balloons might not be what you think.",

The party was about 2 hours long, and after going inside for some cake in the middle, we came out to find the battery had died and needed recharging. The good news is that it didn't take very long to charge back up, but that's something to be aware of if you want this running for a long time to set the mood at a backyard shindig.",

The car is sort of on an \"assisted loop\", in that there are points that require your intervention to continue. It starts off being \"spit out\" by the dragon, then fired from a booth, then launched up a loop, and- if everything goes according to plan - it lands on the head of the dragon which will either fall forward or to the side (not knowing which way is part of the fun). However, if you don't have everything 100% seated properly, it just fails miserably. My kids had trouble getting it to work until I came and reseated some parts more forcefully, but even then we still had a few misfires that caused it not to work.<br />But I suppose that's the tradeoff of the more obscure track sets, sometimes they are more difficult to operate successfully. Part of the fun is making it work, I think. But if you have a kid who isn't up for that challenge, maybe this isn't the set for them. We actually really liked it, and the payoff when it DOES work is the sort of moment that gets high fives and cheers all around.",

I expected more from a product that Disney allowed its brand to appear on, however none of this appears to keep my son from enjoying it immensely. I guess I can't complain too much since ultimately, if HE enjoys playing with it, that's the purpose of the set in the first place. So, 4 stars for being a good toy.

The plus side is that it can actually fit inside our living room if we had opted to have some indoor climbing fun during the cold winter or rainy days. Construction is pretty solid once you have it all together, however the instructions are pretty terrible and difficult to follow. Not only that, but this is NOT something I could have done myself. My kids helped me, and we had to build it over the course of 2 days. To be fair, we did have to quit the first day because it was getting cold and rainy, but we would probably have called it quits by then for the day either way because it was getting late and taking longer than I expected. You need someone to hold the pieces in place while you tighten the nuts, which often made me feel like I needed at least 3 arms if not 4. If I were building it myself I probably would have given up.<br />BUT... once it is assembled? It's everything I wanted it to be. My kid is happy, my older kids want the bigger one now.",

For example, if a kid doesn't know the difference between a crossing guard and a police officer, that's fine! Whatever word they think it was, they act out and everyone else guesses! There are no wrong ways to interpret it, so any child with an imagination can play!<br />He loves this game so much, we even took it recently on a trip to visit his grandparents. If you have a child who is too young to play games that require reading, this is an absolute treasure. I can't believe it took this long for someone to realize the market potential for this.

Also, it seems the language selection is only for the menu, the ROMs are the same and that means titles that aren't English won't be no matter what. Super Mario Bros 3 for example, has the text bubbles from Toad at the end of each world in what appears to be Japanese. I'm guessing this file is a rip from the Japanese cartridge. I tried connecting the device to a computer to see if I can access to the storage and perhaps update it in case they are standard NES rom files (and maybe remove the homebrew roms that we aren't interested in to keep the list manageable). No luck. I found a video teardown on Youtube to see if maybe there is a hidden storage card inside or something. Nothing. It's an OK game player if you have some games available that you actually want to play, but for the money I know there are others that are better and actually let you update what games you want/don't want (and add others if you have access to them).<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I tried one of these handhelds once before and was very disappointed in the lineup. Like that one, this claims hundreds of classic games, but a lot of them you've never heard of. In fact, many of them appear to mostly be weird knock offs or duplicate / slightly modified versions of games you have heard of.<br /><br />That being said, the classics I wanted ARE here! The original NES Mario trilogy is here and can still be played with mostly muscle memory from 30+ years ago! I even introduced some of my kids to my favorite, Super Mario Bros 3, and had all the nostalgia watching them play too. Unfortunately there's also Super Mario 4, 5, 6 and a bunch of other bizarre titles that seems like hacks of existing games with minor modifications. In the rom community, these are often referred to as Homebrew titles. It's a shame that there's so many more of those than real released games to choose from, clogging up the game selection. If you didn't know it wasn't an actual title release, you might be confused as to what is a real game in here.<br />In fact, even the \"real\" games seem slightly off. For example, the original Super Mario Bros has music that plays noticeable too fast. Like the game is on speed. Weird.<br />There are other games I used to own that are not on here, I'm actually wondering if I can modify the storage and put my own NES roms in and take out the weird hack ones, but I haven't been able to pry it away from my kids long enough to experiment with it. I guess that's a good thing, I have to admit I am enjoying this product much more than I expected to. Much better than the last handheld classic player I tried.",

They could be AI, because how many people could there really be using this app at the same time he is?).<br />However, the hardware seems buggy on this. Sometimes the cube will move and the app won't register that movement. Try it again later with the same move, and it does. In the video here, my son demonstrates that it completely loses calibration as he solves the cube. We tried the app on a few different devices in our home, with processors from Qualcomm Snapdragon and other's with Samsung's Exynos (flagship Galaxy S level hardware). It doesn't seem to be the phone/tablet that is the problem, but rather that the cube isn't always registering the movement to send to the app. This causes things to get out of alignment relatively quickly, especially when speed solving, and renders the entire experience frustrating.<br />This had so much potential, we're really disappointed.",

To be fair, that's the selling point of this cube so I suppose there are people out there who might prefer a lighter one like this.

I can't understand the purpose of this door. When my 4 year old jumps into the pit, the force causes the door to flex enough to start leaking balls out. If he roughs around too much, it starts leaking more, until we end up chasing dozens of balls around the playroom to clean it up.<br />I would easily give this 5 stars if not for that door.

However it feels like some things weren't fully thought through and could have been easily made better.<br />For example, the spinner needle feels like it stops exactly on the line more than half the time, causing much arguing and debate over which side it actually landed. If you have ever played the game Life or used a spinning prize wheel, you know there is a much better way to do this: Have plastic borders that catch on the needle so it stops in one space clearly (and makes a cool motor noise as it click-click-clicks quickly). Once you're making giant playing pieces and a large floor mat board, this would not have added a lot of cost and would have made the game infinitely more fun and smooth to play.<br />And speaking of giant playing pieces, once you assemble them, they don't fit back in the box unless you break them apart, something that probably won't last if you do it every time you put the game away. It could have come with a bag or something to store the game board and pieces in. As of now, I'm pretty sure the pieces and board are going to get separated from each other in our family room. It's a fun game, but unlike giant versions of Jenga, Connect Four or Chess, the novelty of giant Sorry wears off quickly and at some point my mother-in-law actually asked why we can't just play it on the table like a regular game. It's fun for the novelty, but the caveats and game mechanics make this not worth more than 3 stars in my opinion.",

    "title": "A really fun and futuristic variation of the classic!",
    "text": "If you were to imagine how they might play Uno in some science fiction future, it would probably go something like this. The rules and concept are largely the same as the classic, but with some fun variation that makes it more interesting: There is now a computerized set of 3 active play piles which add some fun surprises and cool sci-fi sound effects to the game. This sounds more complicated, but honestly after the first couple of rounds it will totally make sense- and be a heck of a lot of fun for family game night!<br />Instead of a single active playing pile, the lights tell the player which piles he can choose to play (one or two or all three), and after each turn they press down on the pile to tell the computer to move on to the next player. However when a pile is picked too often, an internal counter can tell it to \"overload\" and penalize the player with drawing more cards (how close you are to overload is shown with green/yellow/red lights). There are some new cards to mix it up a bit two, including one which just requires players go around pressing until one overloads in a sort of Russian-roulette style mini-game inside the game. One card lets you \"reload\" and start the overload counter over on a particular pile (which makes a satisfying charge up sound effect). Overall it adds some drama and fun to an already classic and fun card game.<br /><br />HOWEVER- this new game is not without some caveats. The biggest one? Making a mistake on your turn and mixing up the gameplay can't be undone. To explain:<br />Let's say someone accidentally presses a pile while reaching for the one they intend to use... especially if they cause that pile to \"overload\", it can really mix up the counter for everyone else playing. We had a couple of moments in which someone accidentally triggered the pile button twice on their turn instead of once, and then then the next player couldn't play the card they wanted to because the pile was no longer active that should have been.<br />Essentially, the computer needs some sort of \"UNDO\" button or something to go back one step in case something goes wrong. Ideally it shouldn't happen, but when playing with 4 kids aged 8-13, it happened at least 3 or 4 times out of two full games played that I witnessed. If they added an undo button I'd give the game 5 stars, its really fun! I still recommend it, but please be careful not to mess up the game during play!",

It'll work for learning and practice and just having fun with a puzzle, but they aren't necessarily as smooth as competition grade movement.<br />Adding some cube lubricant to it helps a little if you want to speed it up, but it's about on par with other budget cubes.

My kids love this and I get to reintroduce them to the silly fun we all had when we were kids. Some people say the metal is the only \"original\", but I remember plastic was an option when I was a kid too, and unlike the metal, the plastic is relatively easy to fix if it gets a minor tangle (just follow the contours and trace it with your finger until it snaps back into place- as opposed to the metal which could bend and never really bend back into place). The only catch is that the plastic is also easily broken if you have to bend it too far to fix. But that's true of all slinkys, so as usual- be careful not to get it tangled!<br />I love that this 3 pack comes in multiple colors. I have multiple kids so they can each pick one and not fight about it. And simultaneous slinky races is totally a thing we all need in our lives. I love it!",

There isn't a lot of imaginative play, and if you don't like the songs (they're kind of annoying honestly), too bad. I wish it had an option to dance to music it hears, I've seen toys that do that with a little mic to hear the beat of music you play at it. This doesn't. It just moves in pre-recorded motions. It doesn't interact with you at all, it doesn't do anything else really. It's one of those toys that is fun and exciting for the first couple of days, then you're over it. There's nothing wrong with that as a fun novelty gift, just don't expect more.",

Well, now we own a home and I can't actually FILL a room with balls, but I can use this to fill a closet with them. I left a note for her to check for a surprise, and she opened the door to a full comedic effect of these balls pouring out, with a note saying \"to our new ballroom\". It was amazing and perfect, and reminded her that I never forgot those conversations. It also gave me new appreciation for how prank shows handle this sort of setup- it was actually really hard to fill the closet without them falling out as I did! (hint: the solution involved using cardboard as a barrier and then pulling it out carefully as I closed the door)<br />After that, we filled the closet back up and repeated the prank for my kids, who immediately started swimming and laughing in them.

This car has multiple modes which are fun and interesting, but the chase one had them (especially my 3-year-old) in absolute stitches trying to catch. The car has sensors that make it similar to a fly... as soon as you get too close, it jumps away, making it difficult to catch for tiny hands. The amount of laughing that following this is worth every penny! The other modes, such as the line track tracing, are interesting and fun for kids to play with as well, but there's 2 major caveats I have with this toy:<br />1) THE MUSIC IS REPETITIVE AND TERRIBLE. It plays music while on. Over and over and over. The follow trace mode sounds like some sort of Spanish song, which isn't bad at all... the first 50 times you hear it. After that, you want to scream to shut it off. My kids love this thing but they can't use it without annoying my wife. Yes, there's a button on the remote control to toggle music, but you also don't need the remote control to use it so my kids would play with it by itself (\"where's the remote?!\" \"we don't need it!\") for hours and my wife had no way to turn off the looping music.<br />2) The car itself does not use standard batteries, rather it has a tiny little circular charging port. It comes with a little wire to charge it with, but much like the remote, it is often missing and very easy to misplace. In fact, as of this writing we haven't been able to find the charging cable for a few days. I'm sure it'll turn up eventually, but it begs the question: Couldn't they have made this a standard charging port like a micro-USB or something? The proprietary charging cable on an obscure device like this is a great disservice to an otherwise super fun product! Standards are good for things like this, people!<br /><br />That being said, this product is enough fun that I REALLY want to give it 5 stars. But the caveats need to at least take one away.

The bigger vehicle can enclose one of the 2 included mini-bikes, and then launch it with a button on the top, or just pull-back on the larger one and the entire thing propels itself forward. Encourages a lot of imagination play, and the construction seems higher quality than I expected for the price. The parts that snap together make a satisfying \"click\", and the launching mechanism is equally satisfying to use. The larger vehicle has optional batteries to make noises, but you can leave it out and the toy is just as much fun. I opted to leave it out and not tell him about this option so that it doesn't just make noise in the background all day- I prefer that he use his imagination for things like that.<br />I'd say its a good value and makes a cute gift!",

    "text": "I've been flying a Phantom 3 for years to get dramatic birds-eye shots in corporate video, but I needed to replace it after a fatal crash on a job recently. I was considering one of the new Mavic Pros, but I couldn't pass up on a deal for this kit. Yes, the Mini 2 just came out and adds a bunch of requested features, most notably 4k recording. However, the 2.7k of this camera is more than adequate for my work, and still gives you the ability to punch in a bit if you want to reframe on a 1080 timeline.<br />The most important part of this fly more pack is the spare batteries- Those are expensive, and while the prop cage and other extras are nice, the batteries are worth far more than the difference in price. I got this kit on sale for about the same price as the regular Mini, and it was a no brainer. It does everything my Phantom did, but is better at it. Yes, the mini 2 is out now and improves some of the features, but in 2020 the mini original is still relevant and an excellent value if you can get one on sale.<br />One caveat:<br />My phone (an LG G7) has an unreliable USB port. It's been broken for nearly a year. I charge with a wireless Qi charger so it has never been important for me to replace my phone. For the Phantom, you connect via a Wifi SSID with your device. With this, however, I need to use a USB connector to the phone. That's annoying, I can't actually use my phone with it so I had to dig up my old phone out of retirement and make that the official drone handset. I can't fault the Mavic Mini for this, really I should get a working phone. But I thought it was interesting that this was never an issue with my Phantom, its only an issue now.<br />I still highly recommend this for advanced and beginner users.",

    "text": "This is a really cool and interesting game! I wasn't sure what to expect based on the box and description, but unlike other contraption based games I've played (like the classic \"mouse trap\" from my youth), this is more of a cooperative play game.<br />There are 4 strings that move a (clearly mission-impossible inspired) suspended character around the playing board, and it takes careful pulling and releasing each of them as a group effort to navigate properly, sort of like a marionette puppet meets a corporate team building activity. There are some things to do like remove security cameras and traps but the truth is, the real fun doesn't start until you open up the jewel cage.<br />Once the cage is open, there's a countdown (you can hear the spring noise whirring as soon as it opens) and the police car starts to slowly circle the board. If you make it to the getaway car with the jewel before the car makes it to block your path, you win! If, however, you take too long, the police car will spring into place and block your path. Hilarity ensues as players start to panic and lose their cool, and in the end, whether you make it or not, it felt exciting.<br />Things I like about the game:<br />- It is cooperative, not individual. So you don't \"beat\" another player, you work as a team to complete the task in time.<br />- The mechanical game board is unique and really fun to learn<br />- It does NOT require batteries! The board uses spring loaded timers where necessary, no electricity. This is cool in a decidedly analog way.<br />- People can walk over and see how it is played and join with very little instruction<br /><br />Things I did not, however, like:<br />- The truth is, when playing with my kids, we sort of skipped the first part of the game and just jumped to the jewel part. The designers of this game tried to make it longer by adding disarming traps and pulling security cameras in particular order based on cards, but it felt tedious after a few rounds. Really the fun part is the end. The whirring police car gives a sense of danger and urgency that makes it fun.<br />- That little spy is suspended by strings that get tangled so quickly and easily. It feels like I sneeze and they are tangled. Out of the box, I had to spend time untwisting it before we played for the first time, so be careful.<br /><br />That being said, the game is TON of fun for different ages and we actually had some guests come over who looked at it and wanted to play too (adults AND kids). They all asked where to to get it, so it might become a regular thing found in our neighborhood. I'd say it deserves 5 stars, it's been a while since a game sparked this much interest that wasn't on a screen.",

Suddenly it makes sense why bikes are easier to ride while moving, and it opens up all kinds of interest in rotation physics. The one I used to have as a kid came with a string you could balance it on and a notch in one end, and as long as it was spinning and you placed the notch over the string, it would balance like a tight rope walker. This one doesn't do that. It came with a string so I thought it would, but it turns out that's just extra string for the pull cord. Which, it happens, I was thankful for since after about 48 hours of owning it, my kids managed to get the string wound up into the axle where it pinched and got caught. Trying to remove it ripped the string off leaving some inside. I had to use a pocket knife and fine tweezers to get it out enough to spin again, so hurray for extra string?<br />Anyway, it does spin quite well so I'll give it that. I feel like the ergonomics of winding it could be better (there's no starting hole), and I wish it weren't so easy for string to get caught inside, but I have to give it credit: it is a fun toy. My kids sort of pointed out that it's similar to a fidget spinner, and that blew my mind. I had never made the connection that the gyroscope I loved so much as a kid was actually the OG fidget spinner. The literature inside the box even has a line that says \"waste your time efficiently, which I found amusing. The box has some fun wording as well (designed in 2020 when there was \"nothing else to do, anyway\"!), however you can clearly see this was made in China and not proofread very well.<br />In a nutshell, it isn't perfect, but it is very good for what it is.

I have a similar sized mini drone that does not have this ring, and it is crashed into furniture and railings more times than I'd care to admit! This really is somewhat \"crash proof\", however only with side collisions. Our living room has a vaulted cathedral style ceiling, and if it hovers too high, the blade of the propeller can easily grind into the ceiling supports and crash / damage the blades. Thankfully it comes with extra propeller blades, but I think it should be called \"Crash resistant\" and not \"crash proof\"! But still a welcome feature. I also like how easy the emergency shut off to kill power is (something another drone I had was missing), and that it comes with two batteries! Often these mini drones only have enough power to last about 7-10 minutes at a time, but they take much longer than that to charge. Having a spare charging while you fly the other is a very welcome extra.<br />But on to the stuff I didn't like: I found that the drone sometimes has trouble being stable. It likes to rotate on its own, sometimes randomly and without warning. If you've ever flown one of these before, you know that knowing which direction is forward is crucial. A lot of these drones sort of \"drift\" over time, but the controller has trim keys you can use to correct for drifting and stabilize. But there's NOTHING you can do about rotation! If it starts rotating, the trim keys don't help at all! You can't stabilize it, you have to try counteracting the rotation and seeing if you just pray it stops. It really creates a challenge making it fly where you want it to. But if you're not the best pilot and sort of assume you'll be crashing into people/things anyway, this is a pretty good option because of the safety ring. Just don't fly it too high!",

    "text": "I have very mixed feelings about this game. First, it is REALLY FUN, and my kids and I were laughing really hard playing it. The drone taking off is really a lot of fun and cool to see, and even our little 3 year old who is too young to play was enamored by it and shrieking when it would lift off with little playing pieces inside! Really a lot of fun.<br />That being said, there are 3 caveats to be aware of:<br />1)I don't feel comfortable letting the kids play this alone. The drone comes crashing down sometimes and I want an adult or kid old enough to be able to catch it to avoid hurting anyone / furniture, or crashing so hard it cracks the plastic (a part of the drone siding already popped out, but I was able to push it back into place).<br /><br />2)  I feel like this game won't last very long. The pieces are VERY easily lost, as they end up being flung around the room as you play. Also, the drone lifting off bumps into the ceiling easily (thankfully we have cathedral ceilings in our living and had to move the game over to there, otherwise it would hit and come crashing down fast). It's only a matter of time before the plastic breaks or pieces get lost forever.<br /><br />3) I dove to catch it on the way down after a particular round, and it hurt my finger. Nothing major, didn't hurt more than stubbing your toe on furniture or stepping on a lego- it has a safety to shut the propeller if it detects something in the way, but I was still surprised. I was fine, but one of my kids would have been crying if it happened to them.<br /><br />My daughter actually suggested we try playing it outside next time, which might solve some of the issues- can't do damage to the house and everyone can duck for cover until it crashes into the grass. Wind might make it less fun though. HOWEVER- this was a TON OF FUN TO PLAY, so even with all those caveats, and even considering it might not last more than a few months in my household, I'd still consider it worth playing even for those few times. The look on their faces when the drone takes off is PRICELESS, and worth it even if you only get to play it once.",

They're cheap knock-offs. I'm guessing this company wanted to sell this device as an emulator for the classics but couldn't get the rights to the original games, so they modified them enough to be different games loosely based on the originals. For example, games like \"plumbers\" are clearly supposed to be a parody of Mario Bros, but none of them are the Mario Bros I remember and wanted to relive. I feel tricked. Also, a lot of the games aren't unique games but merely alternative versions, sometimes they feel like later levels of the same game, and many more aren't even really so interesting to play. The 500+ number is misleading. The UI is also cluttered as there's no way to sort the games and they don't appear to always be in alphabetical order, so you sort of have to scroll until you find the one you want which is annoying. You also can't remove the ones you don't want to clean it up either.<br />Honestly, I really REALLY wish it were just an emulator and you could use a USB cable or something to put your own ROM files like I have on my phone of the original games. And maybe even the ability to remove the ones I'm not interested in so the interface is cleaner. I like the physical layout of this with its physical buttons more than my phone, the second player controller is a treat, as well as the ability to plug this into a big screen (hello minivan entertainment system!), but these just aren't the games I want to play. I want the real retro classics. Not knock-offs. I feel tricked. This could be better if they gave us more control.",

My little ones loved how easy it was to replenish after using up the tank (the entire back opens up so it fills much faster), and the triple-nozzle front was a blast (literally! ha). One thing I didn't realize beforehand, however, is that it works entirely by pump action. That is, unlike a super soaker or other water pistol that builds pressure with the pump and then releases with a trigger, the pump is the entire firing mechanism, and the \"trigger\" is just for show (doesn't do anything). Pulling back on the pump fires the water, and the strength is adjusted  by how hard/fast you pull back. My older kids were able to figure that out, but my youngest (3 years old) found it disappointing. He likes the trigger kind because it is easy for him to fire, and with this he wasn't able to figure out the dexterity to make it shoot very far. For what it is, it works and is fun, but I do sort of wish it had a trigger that wasn't just there for looks.",

They are fun and work well, with the Iron Man being my favorite. This glove, however, is very disappointing. Like the other Marvel firing gloves, you have to load it by pulling back on a mechanism and then perform a motion to fire (Black Panther requires a power slash move, Iron man pull your hand back to reveal repulsors, etc). This one is supposed to fire with a forward motion like a power punch, but it just won't fire without some help on the mechanism. My daughters (who were most excited for this one) weren't able to make it fire at all, my oldest son and I can sort of make it work if we push forward on the firing mechanism with our other hand as we move forward, but there's no way it is supposed to be this complicated.

I dare anyone to put it on and not get into character even for a moment. The firing part is even cooler- you pull back the spring loaded mechanism to load it, then mime a cat slash (flick wrist downward) and it gives a satisfying firing sound that jettisons two darts across the room. The only thing I don't like about it however is that there are 3 darts included and two fire at a time. You could load one at a time if you want, but it feels like they should have included an even number of them. Also, there is no place to store the additional darts. The Iron Man version of this set also comes with 3 darts, but has a place to store all of them on the glove as you lead them one at a time. Firing two with this and then awkwardly holding the third seems like they didn't think it through all the way. But, it's still fun, especially if you love the Black Panther character.",

And I have to say, this is the most fun we've had with one. Aside from the standard controller, the \"gesture mode\" means you can brush your hands in font of proximity sensors and send the drone in a specific direction. This makes it possible to play sort of catch game, as players can pass it from person to person without even touching it, just by waving their hands in the right spot. This mode also helps prevent collisions as it will automatically move away from walls if the proximity sensor detects one getting too close. That combined with the shielded propeller design make this a very good first drone for those new to the whole thing.<br />There are some caveats- while you can start the drone hands free (see video) you still need the controller around. Enabling gesture mode, for example, only seemed to work for me with the button on the remote. While I could put my hand underneath it to tell it to go UP, there was no sensor on the top to go back down, so I need the controller again to lower it and also to eventually land it. Those are minor however, compared to how great and unique of a concept this drone is. I highly recommend it!",

So many different kinds of vehicles, from helicopters to bombers to jets... some really funky looking ones too! They all pull back and then propel themselves forward like the classic pull-back-car toys, but thanks to the wingspan it is pretty easy to make them collide if facing each other. In fact, my son and I did that a few times today and had the planes run into each other, where they then spun in a circle with their wings interlocked until the wound up energy was spent. My kid's reaction? \"Look they are dancing!\" Priceless. Thank you Amazon for offering this amazing set of toys. A perfect gift for any kid who is into aerial vehicles.",

    "text": "This is yet another variation of the \"Boogie Board\" drawing tablet. If you are not familiar with the concept, it is NOT a digital tablet, but essentially a reusable drawing tool much like a whiteboard. It starts off as an opaque black surface that reveals a different color underneath with pressure. So you can draw on it using the included pen, a fingernail, or anything with enough pressure really, and then erase it all at once with the erase button on the bottom. The only electronics involved is a battery that \"zaps\" the display back to opaque to start over. This battery should last years as it only gets used when erasing for a split second.<br />I actually like this one better than some of our other ones as the contrast between the black and revealed color is quite high. Some of the inexpensive Boogie Board clones lack contrast and can be hard to see sometimes, but that is not the case here. It also seems to have a multi-colored background, so as you draw or write, it feels like the color is changing (really it is just revealing a different part of the material behind the LCD). I also really like the size of it, as our other drawing tablets were small whereas this one feels closer to a sheet of paper. My 12 year old son actually finds this comfortable for using as a scratch pad for his math homework, which is a great environmentally friendly alternative to scrap paper. And my younger kids like drawing pictures on it or playing games like tick-tack-toe.<br />You do have to be a little bit careful about resting your hand on it as it seems even that amount of pressure will leave a mark, and sadly you can't erase part of a picture, you can only erase the entire thing in one shot with the button. But this is true of all similar drawing pads due to how it works, so that is no fault of this product. As far as the Boogie Board clones go, this is my favorite so far.",

I recall building tracks with friends (before I was an adult obviously... yeah...) that used momentum, gravity, pulleys and rubber bands to make it to the end of an elaborate track, but modern sets seem to fall back on electricity to give your car a \"bump\" to continue. I honestly thought they had stopped making the classic mechanical \"kicker\", I am SO HAPPY to see this for sale here!<br />To those who think this is a set itself- it is a part, a tool to make a more elaborate hot wheels Rube Goldberg style setup. It is powered by rubber bands, plastic hinges and pure imaginative MAGIC.<br />My kids (2, 7 and 9) spent hours with it this evening, making elaborate gravity loops leading to this KICKER to fling it up over a jump at the end. We had to clean it up and put it away, but they're already talking about how we're going to use it this weekend to something bigger. I love seeing their mechanical imagination juices flowing, and I imagine this is what I looked like when I was... um... younger... playing with similar sets. Thank you Hot Wheels for continuing the fun into the next generation!<br />What's that? No, I'm totally not staying up and building a track in the middle of the night right now... why?",

    "text": "We have quite a few quadcopters in our house between my son and I- everything from micro drones that fit in the palm of your hand to foldables and RC car drone combos to full sized DJI Phantoms. So we have a bit of experience with these sort of things, and I have to say I really like this one.<br />The size is larger than the micro drones but smaller than the RC car combos and a fraction of the pro level ones. This makes it lean enough that we can fly it around indoors but substantial enough to hover and hold it's position properly (the micro drones sometimes shift when a fan turns on LOL). It does all the standard tricks a small Made-in-China drone can be expected to perform, including 360-degree flips, and even includes a surprisingly half decent camera that connects via their app from the play/app store. I mean, its obviously nothing close to my Phantom's camera, and you'd only ever use this for fun and not if you ever want to look at the pictures/video ever again... but it's probably one of the best cheap Chinese drone cameras I've seen yet. Sort of reminds me of a low end cell phone or dash cam in quality, whereas our other cheap drones have horribly grainy/noisy and pixely images with totally wrong and fluctuating color and blown out highlights/darks in any lighting (and one of them even only displays the camera upside-down for some reason- don't ask). The bottom line is, this one is NONE of those things, it's actually pretty decent for a hobby toy.<br />The ONLY thing I don't like about it, however, is the emergency shut off. Every drone, especially toy ones, need to have one of these features. Think of it like an ABORT button, that you press if something goes wrong such as getting too close to a person or ceiling fan blade, etc, or sometimes in our case if it got stuck somewhere and is about to grind off its propellers into a metal shelf. It is supposed to immediately shut all motors and allow the drone to fall from its position. But the shut off on this remote requires you to press and hold the button for a couple of seconds for it to stop. I thought maybe we were doing it wrong so I checked the instructions again, and sure enough it says \"press and hold for a long time\".  I'm including a shot of the manual page, I couldn't believe it until I saw it. That's a horrible idea for an emergency and would likely be too late if you have to hold the button for a while hoping it stops before the drone damages itself or worse, a person.<br />So, I want to give this drone 5 stars, I feel like as a drone it is awesome and fantastic. Flies nicely, has great features and a fun camera, but that shut off is a design flaw worth removing at least one star.",

There is a pin if you want to lock them in place and not smash on impact, and they are actually quite large- bigger than I expected (bigger than an adult's hand). And they come with 6 in a pack!

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:8a35051fba3b622e613e552275a81a53]] This is a great starter drone, in theory. I have flown many of these and my son wanted to try one to get started with. He picked it up really quickly and together we were able to fly it around the house indoors without hitting anything. The camera is gimmicky at best, but for the price I'd say get it for the drone flight fun and forget the camera.<br />UNTIL... within 2 days of owning it, something seemed to go wrong with the height sensor (barometer?), and it not only wouldn't hold the correct height like it did the day before, but suddenly it shot straight UP. No pressing down on the joystick seems to change anything. Its as if the unit felt like it was falling and needed to compensate by flying more aggressively upwards. It hit the ceiling, and we promptly hit the kill switch. I took a look at it, pulled off the propellers to look, and tried again. Same thing - it shot straight UP. Hit the ceiling. I tried cleaning any hair/debris from the blades and again- straight up until it hit. But this time, it started making a funny noise. Upon closer inspection I found one of the pins that the propeller sits on has been bent. I don't know if this was caused by it going straight up or if it caused it, but the drone has been grounded for now. You can see in the attached video how when that pin is spun, it tilts forward and back, rather that the other pins which spin in place.<br />It is possibly that I just got a dud and others would love this, I wouldn't mind trying it again and seeing if I have a different outcome. It did work really well for the first 2 days, and I really like that it not only has a replaceable battery but comes with 2 additional batteries as well! Flight times are usually small on these things so having many extra batteries ready to go is useful. If it hadn't gone nuts and shot upwards everytime, I'd give this thing 5 stars. I'm going to see what I can about sourcing a replacement or additional unit and come back to update this review if it turns out I had a lemon.",

It is just enough to excite him without making a mess (there are only three blocks after all). The problem is, there is little room for creative play beyond that- the track has some ups and downs but you can't really rearrange it in too many ways, and without any curves you can't really do anything other than a straight line. But for a kid around this age, it is a blast. We started adding more things to the tower (like legos and magnet tiles) to create a more epic crash at the end of the tunnel, and he laughs every time.",

The pieces, when assembled, can not only act as a large playing board, but also a sort of floor mat for a kid's room, as it is made of the sort of soft rubbery material you often find play areas made of. My kids also found that they could create 3-dimensional shapes with them by connecting some at 90 degree vertical angles, making cubes and towers instead of just 2-D floor maps.<br />As far as the games- Tic Tac Toe was popular in our household, although it required attaching multiple pieces of the same color together to create 9 larger squares. It adds an interesting twist to gameplay by requiring the pieces to be tossed successfully onto the square you want. Another required skill than just strategy to win the game! Checkers was fun too, but reaching across the board can be difficult for smaller players to do without accidentally moving other pieces. But honestly, both of these games paled in comparison to my kids just loving the board pieces and having fun treating it like giant toy blocks (at one point they made \"shoes\" by creating elongated cubes they could put their feet into and slide around the floor with).<br />I'd say it's a good buy, but for reasons other than just checkers and 3-in-a-row.",

    "text": "This is a very cute concept and something out-of-the-ordinary for a board game! The object of the game is to make it out with the least amount of goo on your shoe. This is represented by actual pieces of putty that you place on the board and squish with your pawn as you land on a square (thus sticking the goo to your, erm, shoe).<br />My kids really enjoyed it, but I can't help feeling like there are some design flaws that could have been prevented. For example, the spinner needs to be deconstructed to put away in the box. The way the board folds (see picture), the crease is over the spinner area, and with the bars on the spinner (which I like, as it looks like a playground toy) won't fit, which means you have to totally take that apart and rebuilt it each time. On that note, it isn't much of a spinner at all, but just a wheel. There is no clicker or arrow that sticks out to slow it down as it spins... it basically spins until momentum from your push wears out, sort of like spinning a top. It takes a while to finally stop on its own, which makes the game feel like it is moving slowly. I was very tempted to just stop it manually a few times, but that might bring up the possibility of cheating.<br />Meanwhile, I wish the goo had more colors, or at least colors that matched the shoes in the game. I can say on the positive note, the goo is very kid friendly!<br />My daughter lost one of the colors and it turns out she was SITTING on it and it was all stuck in her dress. I suddenly had flashbacks of when silly putty got stuck on her clothing and bed and we had to toss them both because it never came off... but this stuff comes off! It easily rolls into balls with your fingers and comes right off clothing in the process. So, definitely some extra points for that! I just wish the game board and spinner were designed a little better, that would make it a lot more fun to play (and put away!).",

It's a pretty unique concept and not at all what I expected coming from the original battleship: Rather than the game of strategy (and sometimes just luck!) that the traditional battleship is, this is mostly a game of skill. There is still some strategy in how you align your boats, but rather than try to determine where the other player's position is, you can see their board and have to toss one of the included ping-pong balls into the holes. Land a ball in all the boat's places, and you've sunk their ship! It is definitely reminiscent of beer pong in skillset, or perhaps one of those arcade games that require you to land a ball in a colored cup. You definitely need more space to play since there will be balls bouncing around if/when you miss, but it is a lot of fun. A creative twist on a classic game!<br />One thing that is a little strange to me however, is the advertising. The listing for this product says \"Nostalgic tabletop gameplay meets interactive digital content for an immersive gaming experience\".  There's nothing digital about this, let alone interactive digital and immersive. It's a pretty fun analog pick-up-and-play game, which is what I like about it actually, but it was hard to determine what we were getting before we tried it.",

They are all the same matching game but with different themed cards and stickers.<br />That being said, I have never played Top Trumps before and at first I thought the instructions made it sound like a rather complicated twist on a classic matching game. However my kids really picked it up and then explained to ME how to play! It really is fun and the whole cube thing makes it more interesting than just another board or card game. I particularly liked our Mario version as a fan of Nintendo, but it seems they have licensed almost any popular franchise so pick the one you like best!",

One of my kids brought one downstairs where we have cheap flooring that is sensitive to water damage, and we found the ducky leaking water from the bath. Leaving water inside these for a long time isn't a good idea anyway long term, so make sure you squeeze them out again before storing after use in the bath. Otherwise, they are super fun and cute!",

But some of the individual tricks are very flimsy and won't last very long. One of the items, a retractable line you attach to something (and make it \"disappear\" by having the line retract quickly) didn't work after one use. Much like a tape measure that got stuck, it wouldn't wind itself back up all the way. My son being somewhat of an engineer in his head, decided to try and fix it by taking it apart.<br />Let's just say that didn't go well, and that particular trick has been disposed of.<br />I'd be inclined to give it 2 stars, except that my son actually still really likes the set despite this.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:7cc971363a284b7d3b621443aac8a13e]] This is a TON of fun, and has been inflated for over a week without losing any air. I'll admit I was slightly concerned when it came without much in the form of instructions or labels (there's a paper with poorly typed tips and warnings, and another with warranty info). Seems like a no-frills made in China product. But I have to admit, once we pumped it up, the kids haven't stopped playing with it.<br />The air valve is a standard sized one (I believe it is called a Boston Valve), so we were able to use a pump from an air mattress to easily inflate it. It took a while to get it fully inflated, although the paper that comes with it warns not to inflate entirely - there should be some give so it can bounce without putting too much pressure on popping it. There are straps inside to adjust to your height and then worn like a backpack, while there are handles in front of you to hold onto. It is pretty self explanatory but it would have been nice to have detailed instructions about, for example, how to tell which way is face up. You'll figure it out without them, but the experience would have been better when using the first time.<br />Something to note: it is IMMENSELY more fun if you have a hill to roll down. Just running around and falling over in it is still fun on flat ground, but to really get the most out of that you should probably get more than one so that people can collide into each other. I've seen people play games like soccer in a set of these, which is hilariously entertaining, but since we only got one here it felt a little meh until we tried the hill falling thing.  I'd recommend getting more than one if you don't have a hill to roll down, but the price can add up pretty quickly.<br />Highly recommended if you have a hill or the budget for multiple ones!",

The launcher shoots balls straight up, sort of like a virtual ball T, unlike pitching machines which throw the ball towards you as from a mound. This system works well enough and it was fun to hit with the included plastic bat (a real bat would send them too far, this is for miniature playing- dare I say, one could even play this indoors if you have enough room and nothing delicate sitting out). The caveat, however, is that there is no safety before it shoots the ball straight up. My younger son who just turned 2 wanted to fetch and reload the balls for his older brother, and when it didn't pop up right away, went to go peek into the hole to see if the ball was there or not. Luckily I saw him and grabbed him away just as the POP of the launcher almost launched a ball into his little face. I can't really fault the product with this too much, I mean, baseball already has tons to keep a toddler away from (swinging bats and flying balls), so really I shouldn't have let him get that close anyway. Just remember to keep an eye on younger kids around this thing.<br />The other caveat is that we seem to have lost some balls already, and from a search here it looks like you may not be able to find replacements so easily that fit. So, be careful not to lose any.",

Not only is it fun to launch cars through the air, you can actually use the garage to store your cars inside to put them away. You can twist the top to make room for a new car, and when that level is full start filling the next one! So essentially you can be \"cleaning up\" while playing. That's awesome! When you want them to come out, you can twist the top again to line up the car you want with the exit door, then push the exit trigger to let the car down the track, which can be connected to more standard track and sets.<br />That last part is very cool because unlike many other hotwheels gimmicky stunt sets, this can actually integrate into your existing track system. See the picture attached where I placed some hotwheels orange track from another set into this one. Now when we want a car to eject, it will go around the track of the garage, and down into the waiting course we made for it.<br />I did notice that some other Hot Wheels cars we own don't necessarily move around the short bend to exit the garage as well as the stunt cars. In particular, my kids tried some of the classic hot rod collectors' cars we have, and some of them got stuck on the bend. But any cars made for stunt sets seem to handle it fine. I won't detract any stars for this because I've had similar experience with other sets. I think the collectors' cars are more for the collection than the tracks.",

They had a really hard time washing it off their hands, and there's a big warning on the package (which we didn't notice until after opening it) that says it may stain fabrics. The paint really easily gets everywhere- we found more of it the day after cleaning it up that we didn't even notice. On that note, the 3D aspect of it is kind of gimmicky at best. You can't really make a three dimensional structure, at most you can make little mountain dollops (as pictured) which take forever to dry. As in, you might need to keep it in a safe place for a couple of days before anyone can touch it. To be fair, they call it \"fluffy\", which it is. But the marketing would have you believe it can be somehow used to create 3D depth sort of like play-doh, which isn't true. Actually, I think Play-doh would probably have been a better project than this. Easier to clean up, can mix colors and make shapes, and dries into solid 3D shapes. But then again you can't use that to paint a picture as well, which this sort of does. So I guess this is sort of a product in between paint and play-doh. Not really what we were expecting.",

I never owned the earlier model, but from what I've seen  of it, it had a larger dragon model with an admittedly cooler looking face. This one seems a bit more subdued, however the additional character pieces are somewhat more updated and cool looking on this one. It still has most of what made the original cool- there are moving pieces that launch projectiles and enough parts to be fun to build and play.<br />It is a great set in and of its own right, just be aware that if you're looking for the original set from 2013 (pre the Ninjago movie), I'm pretty sure they don't make them anymore.",

In the picture you can see they have a diamond shape in the plastic to reinforce and give it extra strength, whereas the other magnet tile clones we own have triangles or grid patterns to reinforce the structure. But either way, they work the same and are compatible with each other.

The one I'm reviewing is not only a replica of a famous monster truck, but it is a whopping 1:10 scale model, which means BIG! Most of our other vehicles fall in between the 1:24-1:15 scale size.<br />It isn't the fastest vehicle, but it makes fun monster truck noises and can effectively climb over other RC cars if you collide at the right angles. Even if you aren't a fan of the classic Monster Truck this is modeled after, it is a hoot to drive around and make big truck noises with.<br />I can't really do it justice in a written review so I'm including a quick video demo so you can hear and see it.<br />One thing to note that I couldn't show in the video: Ours came in a box that appears to be set up for a store display (it said \"try me\", and the remote was wired up to make noises if the buttons are pressed). At first I thought we made a mistake and it was actually a wired toy and not a wireless remote, because there was a ribbon cable that went from the remote into the bottom of the truck, but upon removal we realized it must just be for the \"demo mode\", and the ribbon actually pulls out with the help of a fingernail or flathead screwdriver. Once the ribbon is removed and batteries are put into the remote, it worked as expected, but there was oddly nothing in the instructions about this and it wasn't immediately obvious.",

    "text": "As an RC enthusiast household, this is a very fun addition. My youngest (2 years old at the time of this writing) loves the RC toys his older siblings and I play with, but pretty much all of them are too difficult for him to use. He sure does try though, then gets very frustrated when he can't get it to do much of anything.<br />This toy is perfect- even though it was designed for kids older than him, it is easy enough for him to understand the 2-button layout (one button goes forward, one reverse-while-turning). The idea with this two button control is that he presses the main forward button until it hits something or goes where he doesn't want it to, then press the other button to back up and change the angle, then go again. It doesn't have the precise controls of an adult hobby RC obviously, but to a child who just wants GO and UNDO, this works great!<br />It also has fun sound effects that he really likes, as well as a removable toy driver (which he calls \"Robot\", because with the helmet it looks like a toy robot a bit. In fact, he calls the whole thing his robot car). The only thing I don't like about it, however, is that it uses regular AA batteries. All of our other RC toys use rechargeable packs designed for high output and recharging when depleted, because running a motor uses a relatively high amount of amperage for a small battery, and depletes them pretty quickly. With regular alkalines, this toy seems to still be running after nearly a week, but it is clearly slowing down a lot and should probably be changed.<br />Sure, we could use rechargeable batteries in it, but they actually start with less voltage even when fully charged, so we'd just have to change them more often and get less time at regular speed (if ever) than an alkaline. A week between charges isn't terrible, but it seems more wasteful than our other RC toys and makes me wish it used a rechargeable pack. But otherwise, its a great product for younger fans of remote control toys!",

In fact, on the rear of the box I recall a warning that said \"This is not a toy\", which should have tipped me off to what I was in for!<br />This reminds me more of those hobbyist gas-powered RC cars, the kind that feel like they could probably keep up with an actual car if the driver was crazy enough to drive alongside it. It has spring suspension on the wheels which help it climb (and sometimes fly or flip!) over obstacles, it can drift, and it has a truly impressive range from the remote We were still able to drive it from several houses on our block away!<br />The only thing I don't like about it is how it gets charged. You need to remove the top to access the charging port, and that top is held on by 4 metal clips. Not only are the clips difficult to remove and replace, they are EXTREMELY easy to lose. We thought we lost them a few times already, but eventually they do show up. I know it is only a matter of time before we lose one, then another, etc. I wish there was a way to access the battery port from the rear or bottom of the vehicle so we wouldn't have to remove the entire top to get to it. So removing a star for difficulty in charging, but otherwise this is more fun than anything this size and price range has any business being!",

    "text": "I guess this is good for someone who wants a portable seat with a tray that they can take with them on an outing, but I was more interested in a booster seat to bridge the gap between a high chair and sitting at the table. Our other kids all used one when they were old enough, and it would help make them high enough to join us while also being able to buckle them in for safety.<br />This one, however, seems really short. Unlike the old boosters we had for our previous kids, these don't really \"boost\" high enough for our little guy to reach the table. He likes that it is on a regular chair and not his old high chair, but to be honest, at least his old high chair could go high enough to reach the table comfortably without the tray. And speaking of the tray, this one is a very crude design that just bends and snaps over plastic tabs that stick out. They aren't easy to remove with one hand and sometimes it feels almost like the plastic is bending to the point of breaking when you put it on. The one feature I think is kind of cool is the clear plastic tray to put a phone or tablet underneath. That way your little one can see but not touch the device (useful for watching videos).  It comes with some coloring sheets which were a nice touch, and some app subscription that I wasn't really interested in but might be useful for some.<br />All in all, if you want a portable tray chair or live in a small space that doesn't have room for a full sized high chair,  this might be something for you. That's honestly probably where all the more positive reviews are coming from. But if you want a BOOSTER, that is, something to make your child high enough to sit at the table (which this advertises it can do), this isn't a great option in my opinion.",

To be fair, I think it would be cool to keep on my desk at work or something to add some personality, but it isn't the sort of set you'd build and then use your imagination to play with for hours.

I thought it was ruined, regular washable markers littered all over the thing, and the ink would run onto your hand if touched. But, turns out, this pillow is hand washable and dried like new within hours. I couldn't believe how well it came out, my wife had no idea that it happened!<br />Suffice it to say, this pillow has exceeded my expectations. After all that, it still came out great, is surprisingly soft and comfortable and everyone loves it!",

    "text": "So, I was a little worried about buying this puzzle. There were no reviews for it yet and I'm the type to only buy things online that have been thoroughly reviewed. However, I loved the picture and low puzzle piece count of 300. Therefore, I took a chance on this product and, so far, I like what I see.<br /><br />As described by the product page, this puzzle does not come in a large box with a fancy picture on the front. The box is small, white, and everything fits snuggly inside. What it does come with, however, is a very strikingly beautiful and high quality printed picture that's about 7.75\" x 5.5\". The downside of this small box is that the picture is too wide to fit inside. Therefore, it was folded two ways which left creases (see images). Also, although the image is beautiful, the paper it's printed on is definitely not card stock. It feels like normal printed paper with a semi-glossy top sheen. In all, the picture isn't the best but it's no where near the worst. I really appreciate that the image is printed so well (not fuzzy, high contrast, bright colors, etc) and I really like the slight gloss.<br /><br />The puzzle pieces also look to be good quality. The pieces a very bright and look as beautifully printed as the image with the same glossy finish (Yay!). The wood looks tough and there doesn't seem to be any broken pieces. The bag has a little saw dust here and there but it's nothing than can't be gently wiped away (There is no large collection of saw dust in the bag which is quite nice to see). The pieces are cut very well with no splinters. Also, there are no letters on the back, something I think is a definitely plus because I think letters can be distracting.<br /><br />In conclusion, I definitely think I made a good choice by buying this puzzle. I was worried the picture would be fuzzy, but the image and colors look so vibrant. The puzzle is a gift for my mom on Mother's Day I think she'll like it. &lt;3",

    "title": "Terrible packaging but Beautiful Puzzle",
    "text": "This puzzle was shipped fast to my house and the colors are gorgeous. The puzzle itself is very nice quality.<br /><br />However:<br /><br />1. There is no puzzle box. Nothing. Just some cheap, plastic bag. Mine was coming apart at the seams. Luckily, it arrived with all my pieces.<br /><br />2. The provided picture is a small, 6.5\"x4.5\" print on cheap, flimsy paper (NOT laminated and, therefore, prone to stains and tears)<br /><br />3. The puzzle arrives in 4 large pieces. This is nice because you get instant verification that you have all the pieces. This is NOT nice when you realize that you will have to break apart all 500 pieces yourself.<br /><br />Considering the time and materials that was saved on the manufacturer's side, I feel like this puzzle was very overpriced.<br /><br />This was a gift for my mom, but, in my opinion, this puzzle was no where near gift-ready. I went and bought a box to put the pieces in and a small picture frame for the puzzle picture. I labeled the box, colored it, and gave it to my mom. She loved it.<br /><br />If you are ok with the three points I mentioned above, then I still suggest buying this puzzle. The puzzle is very beautiful with thick pieces and a nice finished size. The Moana picture is cute. The packaging, however, is very skimpy.",
