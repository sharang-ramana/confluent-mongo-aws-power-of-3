    "text": "This is a great BPA-free food grade sensory toy for toddlers. It is rated for toddlers 18 months and older. It looks like an airplane with tentacles. The tentacles are silicone and can be pulled through the body of the \"aircraft.\" There are some others like this that have fidget circles and buttons but this one does not. It is a basic unit.<br /><br />I really like this but it is important to supervise the child when using this. Also, be careful because it can be thrown easily by grabbing onto the tentacles.<br /><br />The current price of $7.19 ($11.99 minus 40%) is excellent for this. For those interested in units with buttons but a little more expensive, then take a look at this [[ASIN:B0B62KX3F9 one]].",

However, the Velcro straps are just so long that I had to wrap the strap around the headrest as well (see photo).<br /><br />There is a mirror and some hanging toys at the bottom. This offers some entertainment value but since there is no crinkly item and the toys hang a bit low, it is not as good as it could be. Also, the current price of $22.99 is a bit pricey for this.<br /><br />UPDATE: I got this for my upstairs neighbor who has a baby. The parents also think this is just okay but not great. It is really not good for their headrest. However, they rigged it to the baby's carriage but the child is only mildly interested. I'd actually pass on this as it is okay but not great.<br /><br />UPDATE Sept 8, 2022 - I lowered my ranking from 3 to 2 stars. My neighbor said that his baby is not interested in this. He said that he likes the toys only, so they detached them so that he could play with those. I definitely cannot recommend this, especially at this price. It has very limited value and interest to an infant.",

    "text": "At the current price of $62.99 ($69.99 minus 10%), this should have all working sides and no screws should be missing. It also should be easier to put together as it took me about one full hour. There are eight parts plus lots of screws and dowels, etc. In addition, there are four loose toy pieces to fit in the holes on the front for play. It took me three Philipps screwdrivers and one flat screwdriver to put this together. Sometimes I had to use two at the same time to create tension on one side as I was screwing in the other side. The picture instructions are somewhat understandable but I really had to pay attention to the details. It is easy to leave out dowels, which I accidentally did.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were only seven E screws provided and not eight, so I could not secure the faceplate at all points. It is on the unit strongly, but I really hate that one screw was left out.<br /><br />The side with the clock is just for show. None of the knobs move and neither does the clock. This unit does wheel like a carriage and the other side does have a star that moves in its track. The front has a mirror and a numbered section (2,3,4) that moves around but that is pretty much it. There are those four separate pieces that fit in the holes on the front. The back has a place for storage of toys.<br /><br />My recommendation is to ALWAYS supervise the child when he or she is using this because it is so heavy that they can turn this over on themselves and get hurt. Also, make sure they are old enough to play with this and not try to swallow those loose pieces that go in the front.<br /><br />If this were easier to assemble, had all the parts, and had both sides with movable pieces, then this would have received 4.5 to 5 stars from me. In its current condition, it is not as interactive as I expected and the difficult assembly and missing screw has me only recommending this with caution.",

I think a five-year old would be okay unsupervised but I doubt some three-year olds would be. So be very careful with this set. I cannot stress that enough.<br /><br />There is nothing holding the letters in place except for gravity when on a horizontal surface.<br /><br />Per the note on the back, it is made of non-toxic paint. This is made in China and the description on the back is not written in very good English. At the current price of $13.99, I do feel it is a tad expensive for what this is.

She comes with winter boots that have to be put on and a shopping bag.<br /><br />She is packaged very well except her head is scrunched to the side in the box. There are only two issues I see that stopped me from rating this gorgeous doll five stars. <br /><br />First, the hair net holding her curls in place had to be cut out. It was all tangled in Sienna's hair and there is a tie in front that can be clipped but it was totally tangled and knotted in her hair in the back. I actually had to cut a few strands of her curly hair off to remove it (see photo).<br /><br />Second, Sienna does not stand up on her own. I kept tweaking the position of her limbs and arms and she still fell down. Since I am leaning her up against a wall, this does not matter much to me, but for some others who want a stand-up doll, this is a deal breaker.<br /><br />Other than this, Sienna is beautiful both for show or play and she is not just for little girls. She is just an ordinary doll (meaning no bells and whistles) with a backstory (see photo of Sienna card). Anyone who plays with her should use their imagination as to her musicality.<br /><br />Since I am not a doll person, I am going to assume the current cost of $59.99 is competitively priced. She is also backed by a 30-day guarantee. Sienna is definitely a keeper to me and she looks great where I placed her.",

It was relatively easy to assemble except a Phillips screwdriver is needed to install four AA batteries (not included). The cardboard background is flimsy but it is only there to stop the balls from escaping.<br /><br />There are seven cups and seven balls. I put the five-point cup in the center and then I put the other cups in increasing score order around the perimeter of the turntable. There is an on/off switch on the side along with a white button to start the game.<br /><br />The object of the game is to bounce the ball off the purple platform (see video and instructions attached) and get them into each cup for the 30 seconds the game continues. Once time is up (when lights go out), count up the score and the highest scorer wins. If two balls land in the same cup (which they will), count that score twice.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun game whose quality is good enough but not great.",

Even though this is a lovely bunny, I cannot give it 5 stars because it looks a bit sickly in the sense that it has an orthopedic malalignment in the neck and hip area and does not look as symmetrical as the Amazon photo shows.

There is a minor imperfection or lump on my board (see last photo lower left interior) but that is so small that it does not take away from the beauty of this board.<br /><br />This game board is suited for a child (or adult). It is lightweight, colorful, and attractive. I love that it has two channels which store the 5 O's and 5 X's. It does require some effort to extract the tiles and is best if one has nails. I also love that this board can be hung on the wall as art when not in use. See the fourth photo to see the slit where it can be hung with the screw and disc provided (photo 2).<br /><br />This Tic-Tac-Toe Board is rated for children 4 years old and up. Nevertheless, since there are small squares, I would still supervise a young child during play.<br /><br />The current price of $14.99 is a good value for this set especially since it is all wood. Overall, I am highly impressed with this light-weight board that is designed well for children and adults who are young at heart. It is both functional and a work of art when hung on the wall.",

This floppy eared hare is perfect for hugging or displaying. I absolutely love it. With this addition, I now have a collection of seven Melissa and Doug animals as follows below and I name all of them.<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B07PHQDPQT Jumbo Bunny Rabbit]] - Daisey (5 stars - this item)<br />- [[ASIN:B016ZM2612 Giant Owl]] - Screech (5 stars)<br />- [[ASIN:B00009YEGL Giant Giraffe]] - Sofie (variation on Sophie) (5 stars)<br />- [[ASIN:B0007POHAW Giant Cheetah]] - Luxxy (4 stars)<br />- [[ASIN:B06VXZW97D Lemur]] - Flint (5 stars)<br />- [[ASIN:B0000YGM3K Giant Dalmatian]] - Sally (5 stars)<br />- [[ASIN:B06WGLG34S Llama]]  - Sasha (4 stars)<br /><br />In summary, this jumbo bunny rabbit is another good plush toy from Melissa and Doug. It is a wonderful gift for a child or for someone like me who loves to collect (and name) their lifelike plush animals. I also consider the current price of $39.99 a good deal.",

    "text": "This doll crib is rated for ages 3 and above and will tightly fit up to a 20\" doll  that is not more than 11\" wide. Once it is assembled, it is sturdy and spacious as can be seen from the pictures. Also, even though this is NOT for pets, cats will be attracted to this immediately. I have three cats and my 16-pound cat slept comfortably in this. As can be seen in the photos, all three cats have used this. You could say this is more for my pussycat dolls than anything else.<br /><br />IN  THE PACKAGE<br />- Carrying bag with handle<br />- Collapsible crib/playpen<br />- Crib mat<br />- Mobile arm<br />- 3 Plush Velcro Clouds<br /><br />WARNING<br />- not for real children<br />- not for pets (NOTE: It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep cats out of this.)<br />- requires adult assembly and disassembly<br />- supervision during use is recommended<br /><br />WHAT I DON'T LIKE<br /><br />- The white writing on the cardboard tag that is attached to the bag is barely readable.<br /><br />- The directions were a bit unclear to me on how to lock the crib; it says to twist the connectors but it does not show them and they are hidden under the fabric so I had to go by feel. Once I got it, it was easy to do.<br /><br />- Also, the directions do not show what to do with the crib mat. It only shows what to do with the crib mat when the unit is collapsed and not how to use it when not collapsed. It might seem self-explanatory, but there is Velcro on the mat, so that has to be attached to itself before laying the mat inside the crib otherwise the tabs are scratchy and stick out and could catch on the doll's or children's clothing.<br /><br />- I was annoyed by the plastic wrapping peeking out from underneath the mobile arm cover. I actually had to remove the mint cover, rip off the plastic, then I had a very difficult time putting the cover back on. If one does not care about plastic wrapping hanging out, then this does not have to be done. I personally do not like packaging material to be hanging out of my stuff.<br /><br />- I am not sure why the Amazon website says \"pack of 3.\" There is no \"pack of 3\" with regard to this crib. It is only one unit or seven pieces altogether as described above.<br /><br />Overall, this is very nice. I love that it matches my parlor walls and I got this for my \"pussycat dolls\" even though it is not rated for that. I even put in an extra cushion for them. This is a crib a child would love for their dolls; just make sure to supervise them at play and ensure the crib is properly assembled and dissembled when desired.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:532e1240db265608ae6e9b8cc0530185]] This is for children over five so I ordered it for me (at least temporarily) and to tease my cats. I think this is super cute.  There are a variety of babbling sounds emanating from this toy. Petting the head is like a cooing sound, cradling him results in sleepy sounds. Holding him upside down results in silly gibberish. There is even an elephant trumpeting sound but I forget how I got that. Clapping once or twice also results in different sounds. However, what is mostly heard is \"ba, ba, ba, ba, pah.\"  I heard that more than anything.<br /><br />There is supposed to be a record option to record my voice but I was unable to get it to work.

    "title": "Fun strategy game for two players ages 4 years and up",
    "text": "This is a fun game. My boyfriend and I played it. It is only a two-player match game like tic-tac-toe or battleship.  The youngest player starts and both players get two cards which they keep face down until the end of the game.  The first player pushes out a cube in the top left corner of the game grid. The next player then pushes out another cube on the board with that same cube. The play continues with each player pushing out the next cube with the previous cube just played without using the same grid hole. The idea is to match five of the same characters in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When one player indicates a match, the losing player turns over their cards and if the character on one of the cards matches the winning players match, then that person now wins the game. If there is no match, then the  winner keeps his win.<br /><br />The game is simple, yet fun, and is full of strategy. There are two negatives, however. The game case is difficult to open and it feels like I am going to break off the plastic prongs when I pull it apart. Also, the game wobbles a bit when the outside \"wings\" are down. Third, it is easy to knock all the cubes out of the game grid. As my boyfriend was playing, he titled the game just a bit to see the characters better and many of the cubes fell out.  Other than the lackluster quality of the game parts, the game itself is wonderfully simple and tremendous fun.",

The two slots in front do not move. The two in back rotate around and around when the car is pulled by the cord.  The tailgate can be moved up or down and the top comes off easily to turn the station wagon into a convertible. In fact it comes off too easily.  A string is attached to the front \"grill\" so that this can be pulled easily.  The headlight \"eyes\" rotate up and down and the wheels cause the back seats to turn as well.<br /><br />The top is thin plastic but the rest of the parts seem made of a more sturdy plastic. No parts appear as if they could fall off and be swallowed, so that is a plus. I was disappointed that the pull cord is not tied off at the end. I had to tie a knot in the end so the cord would not fray.  This is rated for children from 36 months to 15 years (according to the Amazon site).<br /><br />Overall, this is absolutely wonderful and will be thoroughly enjoyed by small children and adults with a child's heart. This looks so nice that I think it would look great under a tree around a large Christmas village (although it is a bit big for that).",

    "text": "This card game is not for two players because if one plays by the rules of the game, the score points will always be a tie. Instead it is for 3-6 players, 8 years to adult. Shame on me for not noticing that before I ordered it. Nevertheless, I just changed the rules a little and still had fun.<br /><br />In the box are 194 picture cards, 30 letter cards, 1 answer / score pad, and 1 60-second timer. Each person is dealt 5 letter and 5 picture cards and each creates a &#34;secret&#34; word for each letter card to match each of the picture cards. For instance, if the picture card has a dog in it and the person associates a word starting with the letter P (such as puppy), when that pair is in play, the other players have to shout out what they think the secret word is. They have to do this for all five-card pairs (letter and picture card) before the timer is up. The person who gets the answer correct, keeps the associated picture card for scoring and the opponent keeps the winning letter card.<br /><br />The game is hilarious and is not easy at all. In fact, since my boyfriend and I were the only players, we had to provide hints to each other so that we could guess more cards.  Also, for two players, I would change the game to include the picture cards that were not guessed into the score of the non-guessing player.<br /><br />Overall, this is a lot of fun. My boyfriend said this is a five-star game. I, on the other hand, give it four stars because I would have liked to see game instructions that would be suitable for two players as I suggested above. Also, the game can be a bit frustrating. For instance, my boyfriend could not come up with a name for certain cards. In one case he had an A and some strange looking picture so he chose the word arbitrary which I did not guess. In fact, in many cases one has to think outside the box to play a good game. Also, I would have liked to see every letter of the alphabet represented.  Instead there are 2 each of an A, H, I, M, O, S, T, W and absolutely no N, Q, X, or Z.",

It takes two AA batteries (included for demonstration purposes only—meaning they may have to be replaced using a Phillips screwdriver shortly after use). The biggest difficulty I had is in removing this truck from the box because it arrives in the ON condition and started working immediately as I was trying to unpack it. That was a bit annoying.<br /><br />The on / off button is located underneath the truck under the cab. There are two levels of sound and lights to choose from when turning on.<br /><br />Once the truck is on, the button in the center of the CAB turns on the ignition sounds and the lights come on.<br /><br />The lights also come on when pressing down on the tires and moving forward and backward. When moving backward, the backup warning sounds activate.<br /><br />The recycling truck container opens in back and can store Legos or other small toys. It also tilts back to the rear.<br /><br />All the sounds of dumping, loading, and idling are realistic. Pressing down on the horns on either side of the cab also generates realistic sounds.<br /><br />The recycling bucket has a slot that allows for placement into the hitch. Once in place, move the lever handle down to dump (or pretend dump) what is in the pail. The pail can also be stored in the top of the truck's container.<br /><br />The instructions are useless as it only talks about the batteries. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the pictures on the box or read the description on Amazon to learn how to fully operate this vehicle. Another option is to learn via trial and error.<br /><br />To me this is an extremely impressive toy for a reasonable price of $29.99.",

Displaying the dice as works of art is equally as great.<br /><br />Provided in the package:<br />- Six die that weigh a combined 4.6 pounds. (See the attached pictures for an idea of size relative to two of my cats and their water fountain.)<br />- A strong canvas pouch for carrying the dice.<br />- A folded one-page pamphlet with two game variations and a sample score card for copying.<br /><br />Each die is beautiful and each &#34;number point&#34; (i.e. dots) on the same die face is painted a rich coffee brown or dark tan. However, the &#34;number points&#34; are various shades of coffee brown on each side of the same die, so there is a slight inconsistency in color there. Nevertheless, this does not take away from their beauty.  One should discount the &#34;life-sized&#34; claim. They are large but all of them stacked three high, side-by-side, do not even reach the height of a poised cat as you can see from my photos. When used for play instead of art, the round edge of each die provides for a smooth roll and reduction of injury to property or person.  Although this is rated for ages 6 and above, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND children, adults, and pets stay far back when rolling the dice.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I played the first game on my inside carpet since it was raining outside. I made sure to remove any items that could break around the area we were playing and I had to keep shooing the cats away. I originally thought we had to roll all six die at once (which is impossible). Therefore, when playing the two games in the instructions, roll each die one at a time because they are too large to roll together. The instructions should say that, however, because the first thought I had is &#34;How am I going to roll these six die all at once,&#34; when the instructions said &#34;roll the dice&#34;?<br /><br />My boyfriend loved the dice and the game even though I won. Since each die is heavy, it is extremely important to throw each die gently. I can see unsupervised children or drunk adults throwing these at each other and causing serious damage or death. As long as everyone plays responsibly, hours of fun and friendly competition are awaiting those who play this lawn or carpeted basement &#34;game.&#34;",

The front left foot is off the ground and turned at an odd angle and the front right foot is straight. I attached some pictures. Note that the deformity was not caused by shipping because it shipped in a sizable box that allowed for the full body, except for the tail, to lay flat. It is apparently a defect in the manufacturing.<br /><br />This is medium sized stuffed dinosaur at about 33 inches from tip to tail and around 17 inches tall. It is not a stuffed toy that I would buy a child because it is so unstable and not cute or cuddly.

    "text": "This game is rated for 3-6 players ages 14+. However, my boyfriend and I were able to play by just leaving out the head-to-head (challenge cards) for each category.<br /><br />The object of the game is to be the first one to win a game piece in all four game categories. I love board games and so does my boyfriend, which is why I got this. At the beginning we found playing this game nearly impossible. Neither one of us watch TV (this is based on a TV series) nor have cable.  Therefore, it took us a while to even understand what this was about and what many of the game cards were asking us to do. We kept asking ourselves “Are we really that stupid?” However, after playing for almost 2 hours, we were enlightened. Nevertheless, for the uninitiated, this game might be challenging and confusing the first time around. After that not so much because then one remembers how to solve most of the cards and when that happens, this game will have to be “retired” for a while.<br /><br />Below is a sentence on the box top which provides a good, yet very simple, idea of what “brain games” are all about.<br />THINK YOU<br />YOU CAN'T<br />BE FOOLED?<br />You just were. Read it again.<br /><br />If you did not find the double YOU in the phrase on the first try, then you were fooled.<br /><br />WHAT'S IN THE BOX:<br />- 192 game cards consisting of 48 cards each in each of the 4 categories (mind & body, language, logic, vision)<br />- A &#34;box topper&#34; with 4 game slots to hold the cards<br />- 40 hexagon shaped game tiles (8 tiles for each category, 4 wild, and 4 lose-a-turn)<br />- 6 pawns (playing pieces)<br />- 6 score cards<br />- 1 game board in 4 puzzle pieces<br />- 1 die that holds numbers 1, 2, & 3 only (two times)<br /><br />Everything is made of cardboard except for the pawns and die. The score cards and puzzle pieces are easily punched out of the cardboard card provided.<br /><br />In summary, this game is good for those who like to be challenged or know what the game is about. However, if you play this several times, you'll probably remember the answers and have to put this away for about one year before playing it again.",

The tiles should be face down so that the other player or players don't see them.  Each player adds up the numbers on each of their tiles. If a player  has a tile with three of the same numbers on the tile, then the player with the highest combination goes first. For example , a player with three 5's (which is equal to 15) would go before a player with three 4's (which is 12) and score the bonus points explained in the instruction card. If no player has a Tri-Omino tile, then the player with the highest numbered tiled goes first but no bonus points would be given.<br /><br />The idea is for a player to match his or her tile to a tile on the board that has two of the same numbers.  They basically get connected the way that it is done with Dominos. The score gets added up for each tile placed. Those that can't make a match pick from the “well” or remaining face down tiles. Each pick from the well cost the player 5 points from their score. If you can't match any Tri-Omino in your hand and the well is empty, ten points are deducted from your score and the play continues.<br /><br />The first player to play all of his Tri-Ominos wins the round and receives a 25-point bonus plus the total points of all the Tri-Ominos left in the other players' hands. If the game is blocked, then the player with the least amount of tiles wins and gets to add all the points from the left over tiles to their score but there are no bonus points given. This player must also deduct the total number of points that were left in his hand from his score.  This method of play gets repeated until  a player reaches 400 points to win the game. There are a few other ways to get bonus points in a game as well.<br /><br />Scoring is done after every play, so from this perspective the game can be tedious. However, it is a lot of fun and for young children, the process of adding up the numbers on the tiles is an education in math. My boyfriend and I really love this game.  Playing a full game with two people takes a couple of hours.",

    "title": "Electronic Scrabble Twist is SO COOL but the instructions could be better & Hasbro should reduce the packaging",
    "text": "This game is a new \"twist\" (pun intended) on a classic game of Scrabble.  The objective is to form as many 3 to 5 letter words from the same 5 letters in a certain number of seconds depending on the game and level selected.<br /><br />FACTS:<br />- This is for ages 8+ for 1-9 players based on the game chosen.<br />- 3 AA batteries are required and are NOT INCLUDED.<br />- The battery compartment is secured with a Phillips head screw.<br />- Two letter words are not allowed; only 3 to 5 letter words can be formed.<br />- The unit turns on with a twist (in either direction) and goes to sleep after 30 seconds automatically.<br />- If the unit is turned upside down the letters flip automatically. This is a great feature when passing the game around during play with multiple parties.<br />- The twist feature is used to scroll through the menus and to score the words you find.<br />- Play begins by pressing one of the five buttons to select a game, select player numbers, and to tap the words you find (must tap in the order the word is spelled)<br />- There are 3 types of play (PARTY & TURBO are for 2-8 players; SOLO is for 1 player).<br />- A reset button on the back of the unit removes the highest stored scores from memory.<br /><br />At first I didn't understand how to begin playing. It took me about 10 minutes of fussing around to figure out how this worked, even after reading the instructions.<br /><br />Although the instructions are not written as I'm describing them below, this is actually how the game works. I'm going to use the SOLO play as an example.<br />- After inserting the battery and peeling off the 5 letter labels covering the LED buttons, twist to start the unit.<br />- Twist 2 more times to cycle through to the SOLO option.<br />- Press one of the clear buttons to begin playing immediately.  This assumes you accept the default volume and play levels.<br />- You will be presented with 5 letters. For example, if you are presented with<br /><br />L  M  A  E  D<br /><br />You would try to form as many words as possible by pressing the letter buttons in the order the word is spelled and then twisting to score the word. In the above example, I might press the letters M A D E and then twist. The letters will be re-ordered as M A D E L. I might then press D A M E and twist. I would continue to form as many words as I could from these letters and twist each time until the time is up. This almost reminds me of a Simon Says game but with letters that I form into words.<br /><br />If I wanted to change the default play levels and the volume, I'd twist to turn the unit on, and then twist 4 more times to see the volume. To see the volume level, I'd press one of the clear letter buttons and twist, twist, twist to set it to the desired level or mute it. When the desired volume is reached, I'd press one of the clear buttons again to be taken back to the volume and then twist to select the level of play. I'd then press the button to see easy play and then twist to cycle through to mid and pro levels. When done I'd press one of the clear buttons on the front and then keep twisting until I see the game level I  want (PARTY, TURBO, or SOLO) and then I'd follow the instructions in the manual or the ones above for playing a SOLO game.<br /><br />In summary, I've been playing the SOLO game for a couple of days and love it. I selected this for that level of play. I also tried the PARTY game by myself and feel it would be a lot of fun. I do feel that Hasbro Gaming needs to provide an example for each game level of how to play, sort of like I did above with the SOLO game. Although the instructions are good, they are written in a piecemeal fashion describing each individual feature which causes the user to have to read all the instructions just to figure out one of the three games. In addition, I feel they should reduce the packaging this comes in to one quarter the size it is now because all there is to this game is a tiny handheld unit and a folded one page (that turns into four printed sides) instruction pamphlet. Despite this, I love Electronic Scrabble Twist for both the fun and cool factor. I am also thrilled that I can play the game by myself and I'm addicted to it.<br /><br />UPDATE August 10, 2015 - I had my boyfriend try this and he thinks it's great as well. However, he had the same problem figuring the game out until I showed him. Once you figure how to start the game and work the unit, it is so easy and hard to believe there would have been a problem in the first place.  I think this game is really going to be popular. I love it. I just wish the initial paper instructions were better.",

Included in the box are:<br />- One game instruction sheet<br />- 441 Black Apple Cards<br />- 63 White Apple Cards<br />- 25 Scoring Tokens<br /><br />After all the like colored cards are combined and shuffled (good luck shuffling 441 cards; I couldn't do it), the cards get stored face-down in the plastic game tray/box they came in along with the tokens.<br /><br />The game of play is as follows:<br />- Each of the 4 or more players are dealt 5 black cards each.<br />- The one player in each round who is the judge picks one white card and chooses one of the two words on the cards. He or she then says the word out loud and places the card face up on the table.<br />- The remaining players pick a black card from their hand that they think best describes the word being played. They put that card face own in the center and when all the players have submitted their card, the black cards in the center get mixed up.<br />- The judge then reads each card aloud and the player who submitted that card makes their case to the judge of why their card best exemplifies the word being played.<br />- The player who won their case with the judge gets a token.<br />- The play then continues to the left with the card decks and judging responsibility becoming the role of the next player. Each player whose card count is less than 5 black cards is dealt another card.<br />- The game ends when there is a winner with four tokens.<br /><br />What makes this game so much fun is the conversation that occurs when convincing the judge. For instance, the judge might pick the word squishy and a player might pick the card about fish and say something like when you're preparing the fish and stretching it out for cooking it becomes all squishy.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I loved it and found it hilarious. We even found it more challenging because the two other people we planned to play with weren't available. As a result, we wound up playing two hands a piece with one of us playing one hand when we were the judge. That brought another whole level of ridiculousness to the table. It was difficult not to pick our own selections as winners.<br /><br />This game is only limited by each player's imagination and ability to argue their case. It's perfect for parties or large gatherings with 4 to 8 players.",

Nevertheless, everything is still low quality and flimsy.<br /><br />What you get is a \"Made in the USA game\" (with US and imported parts) that includes:<br /><br />1 cardboard instructions (under which the game board is hidden)<br />1 flat piece of cardboard as the game board with a center hole cut out<br />4 circular foam dots that need to be affixed to the POP-O-MATIC dice roller<br />1 POP-O-MATIC dice roller that just gets placed in the center hole during play<br />16 tiny plastic Minion game pieces in 4 different colors (green, orange, blue, and yellow)*<br />1 tiny plastic Siren Bob Minion*<br /><br />  *Be careful as these small pieces represent a choking hazard.<br /><br />The object of the game is for each of the 2-4 players to get their 4 Minions onto and around the track toward the stairs that indicate home.  If a Minion lands on another Minion while going around the track, that Minion is sent back home. The only time that the Minion is safe on the track is if the team member is protected by Siren Bob as a result of drawing that die with the POP-O-MATIC. In that case, the Minion whose turn it is cannot move (because they cannot land on another Minion who is protected) and their turn is over. This process of play continues until the team member has all their Minions on their steps (one step each). This is just a variation on the standard game of Trouble and developed in support of the upcoming Minions film due out on July 10, 2015.<br /><br />In summary, I think this game is fun for ages 5 up to adult. \"Trouble Game Despicable Me Edition\" definitely will not stand up to any abuse. However, after purchasing many board games for myself over the years, I noticed there is a tendency for the \"Hasbros\" of the world to make things cheaper and cheaper and the quality is just built into games priced under $50. Since lower quality game boards are now typical in today's society, I am giving this 3 stars instead of 2.  Just consider this disposable, yet fun.",

    "text": "The Schleich barn is made of wood and is of extremely high quality except for a problem with the clips and pieces of wood that hold the barn roof together.<br /><br />The barn opens into two separate unattached halves that slide together at right angles like a puzzle.  There are latches on either short side of the barn that can be unlatched to display each half. The barn can be left open or closed. When closed it is easy to carry. A cow, chicken, donkey, lamb, hay bale, basket, red and green vegetables, and a pitch fork and broom are the accessories included. The barn doors on the long side of the barn open in both front and back.  The color is vibrant and the farm animals are very realistic.<br /><br />The only negative I found is that the entire barn is held together with clips that come apart. The clips are not its strongest point.  The four clips on either side of the barn roof on mine would not hold up the roof and the boards keep falling off.  I tried for over 30 minutes to get two of the clips seated correctly but neither side would snap in place. My boyfriend also looked at this barn and he could not get the clips to seat firmly in place either. He did say, however, that this is a well-made toy. According to the side of the box below the Germany label, it says this is made in Slovakia.<br /><br />The clips and vegetable pieces that come with the barn can present a choking hazard to a small child. If the child is of that age where items are frequently \"tasted,\" then I recommend adult supervision while the child is playing with this barn. The box indicates that this is not for children under 3 years of age and does state that the small parts present a choking hazard.  This is typical of many toys with small parts, however.<br /><br />Other than this, I got this for my friend's son to play with and he's going to love it. However, he'll have to play with the two roof slats off since they will fall off in its current condition. If the unit I received did not have this problem, I would have rated this 5 stars.  Since mine does have this problem, I'm rating it 3. Had I purchased this unit and not received it for review, I would have returned it for a replacement. Since the three other reviewers have not complained about this issue, I suspect it is either a new issue introduced in recent manufacturing design or the unit I received is slightly defective. If there are no other recent reviews that complain about the clips and barn roof, then I would consider this a 5-star toy where I was the one exception. Nevertheless, this defect will not detract from my friend's son enjoyment as young children rarely notice those things.",

    "text": "This busy barn is sturdy and heavy at 10.30 pounds.  It sit's flush with the floor.  Even though it is heavy, an overactive child may be able to tip or push this over especially if placed on a rug.<br /><br />This educational toy is rated for 18 months and over and every side has an activity that will appeal to a toddler. There are 5 sides.<br /><br />- The roof is the counting area from 1-10 with boxes that have those number of items. For example, number 9 has 9 leaves in a box. The pictures are left up to the imagination as numbers 3, 6, 7, 8 (perhaps what is shown is blue and yellow corn), and 10 are not obvious items to me.<br /><br />- The front side has three doors that reveal various animals.<br /><br />- The back side has three gears that turn and one of those gears is the sun.<br /><br />- One side has an alphabet that can be turned to reveal an item that starts with that letter, like A for apple. The alphabet is displayed from left to right side with the last two letters at the bottom center.  Since two tiles are left on the left and right of the long alphabet column, they are filled up with various shapes like a triangle, circle, rectangle, etc.<br /><br />- The other side has a cow, tractor, and chicken that can be moved around on a vertical tract.<br /><br />I do like that the alphabet side allows for a parent's hands to stick inside for cleaning should a child drop food or sticky items inside during play. This is a big plus to me.<br /><br />The top appears to be made of plywood or particle board; I can't tell which.  I think its plywood because it has several layers.  Nevertheless, that is an engineered wood product; so to say this is wood is not a total lie but not a total truth either.  I do think the rest of the activity barn is made with wood but it is hard for me to tell.<br /><br />I do feel this activity barn will keep a young child engaged and learning and his or her motor skills going. Obviously mom or dad will have to point out how to count and what's on the other side of each alphabet and shape cube.  I know my friend's boy who is just about 18 months is going to love this.<br /><br />It's sturdy, heavy, and engaging but at the current price of $66.94 and the fact that it is not all solid wood makes this a bit steep for what this is. I feel it's about $22 overpriced. Other than this, it's perfect for toddlers 18 months and older.  I also love that the barn is extremely colorful and I'm sure a toddler will be attracted to this as well.<br /><br />UPDATE Nov. 13, 2014 - My friend's 15-month old toddler has been enjoying exploring this toy.  He  mostly likes opening and closing the doors.  As he gets older he'll no doubt become interested in playing with the alphabet tiles and the train tracks.",

The manual is easy to understand and helps with assembling the individual pieces into a couple of towers, cargo, and tower for the flag. Even though this is rated for 2-5 years old my friend's 6-year old will still enjoy this. At least he can use the train with the Thomas Wooden Railway Tower I got him.<br /><br />When done with play, the pieces can be stored in the plastic carrying case. I do feel $39.99 is a bit steep for what this is and this was the only reason I rated this 4 stars.  Otherwise, this Mega Bloks set is entertaining for pre-schoolers and a little beyond that age.",

    "title": "Young children can let their imagination run wild with this quality adventure tower but they'll want you to purchase more parts",
    "text": "This adventure tower comes well packaged, as inside the box is a large Styrofoam case containing the 22 pieces that makes up this wooden railway tower.  The 22 pieces consist of:<br /><br />- 2 tower levels<br />- 1 center support<br />- 2 other center pieces that slide into the center support<br />- 8 wooden tracks that fit together like a puzzle creating a circular track at floor level<br />- 1 wooden train car<br />- 1 wooden shipping container (this magnetically attaches to either the train or the crane at the top)<br />- 3 separate pieces that make up the crane at the top. One caveat I have here is that the small red saucer with string that contains the magnet could become a choking hazard if a child dis-assembles it from the crane. Therefore, I would suggest supervising younger children when playing with this piece.<br />- 4 plastic supports or ledge pieces that fit into the \"window holes\" below the 1st level. These are used to support the optional curved track pieces that can be purchased separately.  I also feel these 4 pieces can be a choking hazard if a child removes them especially when the optional track is not laying on top of them.<br /><br />What I love is that no tools are required for assembly. Assembly was relatively easy once I understood that I had to release the clips on the underside of the 2nd (and 3rd) levels so that those levels would slip into place. It also took me a few minutes to figure out what the 4 blue pieces were for (plastic supports for the optional track).  Even with the slight confusion I had with regard to the instructions, I was still able to assemble this in 30 minutes.  Someone who has assembled this tower before, can probably do it in 5 minutes.  It also comes apart pretty easily.  Also replacement parts are not available from Fisher-Price at this time as per their website.<br /><br />This tower with crane stands almost 3 feet tall (2 feet 31-1/4 inches) and 2 feet wide at their widest points.<br /><br />This is a well built tower that definitely will engage young children (especially boys) as they let their imagination run wild as they play with the train on each level. Play is also all manual.  The train car has to be pushed around the floor-level wooden track or around the grooved tracks on the second and third levels. The crane magnet can also be lowered and raised manually via a dial that operates the winch. I do feel very strongly that a child will want the additional elevated track and some more train pieces to enhance the play session but these items will have to be purchased separately, thereby increasing the cost associated with this purchase.  One train car is definitely not enough especially if the child is playing with a buddy.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the one page \"picture instructions\" did not provide a list of additional pieces that could be purchased, such as the elevated tracks and wooden train cars or train engines.  I did put their website in the comments section of this review so those who are interested can inquire.<br /><br />In summary, this is a well-quality adventure tower that will provide hours of entertainment for young children with an active imagination who are in the 3 to 8 year-old age range. The picture on the box indicates this is for children 3+.  I do feel this is a bit expensive at the current price of $193.98. Had they included additional accessories like more train cars and the elevated track, I might be more agreeable to the price. I rated this 4 stars only because of this high price (I believe it's worth $125) and my belief that children will want more \"accessories.\"  Other than this, it's well-built, entertaining, and artistic (some adult hobbyist might like it too).  I can't wait to hear their reaction when my friend's children see and play with this set.<br /><br />UPDATE Oct 16, 2014 - My friend's 6-year-old son has been enjoying playtime with this tower. I got him the [[ASIN:B00J05NA9Y Mega Bloks Thomas & Friends Rescue Center Heroes]] to enjoy with this because this tower was so sparse.",

There are now sounds and music with the addition of the electronic game unit that takes 3 AAA batteries.<br />2.  The board is broken down into 4 transport zones (walking, cycle, car, and rocket) that allows the players to either take a chance (via the game unit) or force a deal with the properties.<br />3.  The game board is round and 4 utilities instead of 2 have been included.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Instead of paper money, each of the 6 players are now given an ATM card to use with the game unit with a starting balance of 1.5 million.<br />- The prices of the property, houses, rent, etc. have been raised in line with today's costs.<br />- The game unit, music, transport zones, and round board are wonderful new twists to the game.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The game unit display (LED) is very hard to read; perhaps a swivel display with a brighter LED is the solution.<br />- You'll need a screwdriver to install the 3 AAA batteries into the unit.<br />- Since the dice are clear, they are hard to locate if you drop them on the floor.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I enjoyed playing this new version and it is certainly more fun with additional players.  This version has enough ATM cards for 6 players (older versions of Monopoly allow for 8 players). We also love the new \"twists\" on the game.",

Other games say for children 3 and up and then say 1-3 players, etc.  This box doesn't give you a player count.<br />Since we don't have another couple to play this game with, I just wasted my money.  The manufacturer needs to change their packaging to say for 2 - 4 couples over 18 years.  I'm extremely disappointed.<br /> The game board folds in four and looks like it would easily wear out if you used it a lot. However, if I had the appropriate amount of participants, it looks like the game would be good for a few laughs and some healthy fun.  I suspect you couldn't play it over and over as eventually you'll have answered all the questions.  What you really need is a steady dose of different couples to play the game with so that the game stays interesting.<br />However, if you don't have the requested participants, you've just wasted your money as the game requires 2-4 couples.",

I'm not even a *huge* HP fan. The game play is super fun and I love that there are 7 levels (\"school years\") of difficulty. We played from 1 to 7 to start. As avid game players, we like to play year 5 if we want to sit down and play just one game that we're pretty certain we will win. Years 6 and 7 were a challenge to defeat; much is up to luck. I love that the game is so adjustable depending on who you're playing with or even what mood you're in for the night. And truly, the game play elements are really so thoughtful. Also, this game cards and pieces are HIGH QUALITY. This game is more expensive than some but without a doubt worth the money for what you physically receive as well as the different experiences you can have with it. If you're looking for a quick, easy game to play with young kids, this isn't it; particularly the higher levels take a good deal of brain power and strategy.",

So bad my granddaughter couldn't carry it tonight for Halloween. Paid for expedited shipping to receive by 10/29/13 and sent message to seller close to the date and was assured it would arrive by the 29th. It came today, 10/31/13 by USPS-not expedited at all. I would not recommend this seller to anyone. Nothing about it looks like the picture shown-I consider that fraudulent advertising. I hope no other granddaughters received what I sent to my granddaughter. Her disappointment will stay with me a long time. It also had material around the top of the basket that made it look even worse. I will NEVER use this seller again!!!!",

Although I do wish these were in sets of 10… these offer up a fun way to make a game about them. Tiny animals can be mixed up and sorted into their bowls which practices grouping. They can be counted in random colors in sets of 10,20,30… these are great to teach the beginning aspects of adding/subtracting but, most of all- they're just a fun “toy” that kids don't even realize their putting any mathematics into play..!!<br /><br />Easily used in a classroom of playroom.. even the bathtub! We've used this way a few times.. our little one loves to suction stick them everywhere! Then, he uses his “tongs” to remove 1x1.. ha! He's made up his own game and loves to count off as he's doing so- btw, he's only 2.7months.. and he can count them off to 20 (with the exception of a few teen numbers getting skipped!!) Definitely a great way to get ready for preschool.. at a price point of $15- this will be around for any siblings to follow. Could be used in a classroom or daycare- but keep in mind.. the smaller number makes them a bit limited.<br /><br />Smaller in size.. be sure of these do not make it into mouths of smaller children. Otherwise, a really great learning tool. A great add-on or gift for the preschool age… hoping info helps decision- stay safe, everyone!",

Fun activities are engaging and pages are sized in a way that book is easy to take anywhere. Each page is created on a stronger pressboard page with a coated laminate.. making them durable to hold up to the wear and tear the younger kiddos can bring! Comes with hole punch and x2 included jump rings to connect into a flip book. The set up offers ability to connect into x1 larger solid book or x2 separate smaller sizes. Easily removed from the jump ring as needed to reach multiple kids at one time- would be ideal for any preschool or daycare setting as well.<br /><br />Each board/page is clearly marked and color-coded in the right hand corner with a gradual incline in skill level from easier to advanced. Making it very simple to take apart and clip back in order just the same for adults!<br /><br />Set comes with x4 colored dry erase markers.. with kid proof lids! Could be a helpful, perk or a nuisance.. depending on independence, you're trying to achieve. *I made a simple switch of white board markers so, little one could have satisfaction of completing task on his own- mini whiteboard eraser, easily fits in the hand, and does its job to clear the board.. I do suggest wiping clean of all marking so nothing stains pages or settles- bc, they will!<br /><br />A solid learning tool that boasts integrity to be used by multiple children, overtime or in a class setting.. If needed, replaceable markers can keep this user-friendly even when markers run dry! Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",

This has a uniqueness about it that seems to stir up a natural curiosity and draw you to it.. cheery, fun colors are perfect and their individual enclosed case are just whimsical and too cute! Best of all, these have a nice soothing affect- twist and kneading can be very methodical.<br /><br />Ordered in a set of x4.. can be used together more in separate locations or gifted individually- nothing is marked to say otherwise! Overall feel is of a mixture of stress ball and Play-Doh but it leaves no mess! It's appropriate for any age on up through adulthood..<br /><br />Tiny plastic house “steamers” hold each ball.. there is a lack of quality control with the finishing on edges- not all lids seal 100% bc of the “leftover” plastic around the lip. Good news is these do not need to be sealed as they will not dry out.. downside, it can feel a tad sharp and may need to be trimmed up! Not a dealbreaker, but something to be aware of.. something that could easily be rectified by seller as well! (See photos to give an idea!) Note: these do pick up lint or debris easily- not using on carpet or flooring is highly recommended. If dirtied.. they can be washed off with soapy water- and I find work best if lightly dusted with a sprinkle of baby powder!! Helps them feel smooth not sticky-<br /><br />I find these totally unique and a fun item to twist and pull- makes a great addition for a respectable price.

    "title": "Want to learn to juggle? 100% for teens/adults.. takes patience and skill!",
    "text": "Having a similar toy with a “U” shape elbow that was a fully enclosed tube with open ends.. I was expecting that same type of needed skill set for this item. For anyone like me who thinks it's comparable to the mentioned toy.. this is far more difficult bc of the open design. I believe this IS for those interested in beginner steps in the process of juggling vs. inclosed style that is about the methodical rhythm + feel received as its end goal. The open tube creates the opposite vibe- with intention to develop a skill that is difficult and will take plenty of patience and practice to pull it off. Something that's not always relaxing-<br /><br />U shape piece is very sturdy and easy to grip and hold steady. Did not realize it came with x2 U pieces.. One ea. in light/dark blue. To begin one masters moving a ball inside a U and developing ability to have ball roll up one side, actually arch and become airborne then, land and roll back down the opposite side of tube. Eventually, moving to the ability to incorporate one U in each hand.. while completing the ball process ie., just like juggling! This helps create a feel/motion for a user- then it's practice, practice, practice till ready to toss balls without the aid of the  device.. and gain the skill of juggling!!<br /><br />Ball has smooth exterior with a weighted feel similar to a golf ball and approx in size as well.. The weighted component actually makes the juggling process easier to learn. Careful bc these can go rogue while learning.. so, be free and clear of breakable items! Best in a larger space or one you've prepped and removed breakables!<br /><br />Solidly made for a specific purpose. In theory, it feels capable of aiding user to develop a skill. Best to keep in mind- definitely a fun challenge for those who have interest. Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:8f7fe309a67a9bfde68a14ae2a4f610d]] Created in likeness of an ATM machine- it functions as a piggy bank or, simply a child's toy! Simulating an adult action most kiddos find super awesome- ie, dreaming to drive car, grocery checkout, make-up, ATM, etc.. Kudos to a clever idea that mimics a few realistic features- it's unlike any other toy I've seen of its kind.<br /><br />Includes instruction manual with NEED TO KNOW INFO.. including the PIN # to open bank door.. without it you have no access!! Toy itself does NOT have ANY prompts or cues on “how to” operate found on keypad!! Basically, if haven't read or have access to manual then you wont know  how to operate, open.. or turn it on!<br /><br />A standard # Keypad controls device.. the Asterisk * in left hand corner is “command” button- it shuffles options such as songs, abc's, animals, sounds, PIN code, etc. it just isn't marked in any capacity. Making this key in a color (ie. a green button) or labeling would fix so much. Also, no stop.. or on/off button (ie. a red button!) Hit a wrong choice- ha.. it must cycle thru! One perk to that- it's relatively quick and kids seem to like it. I included photos to try + help make sense of the info. above- Note: password is 0000.<br /><br />The bill slot is tricky depending on age.. our 3yr old struggles bc of dexterity level and fact, $ is paper thin- it can bend/crease in trying to align putting into slot- it can prove a bit tricky for littler kiddos. Only if $ was laminated.. it would make all the difference. *I may laminate to solve problem.. and preserve the $. Also, as bills slide thru they end up disheveled on inside.. laminating would fix this as well. *Has a coin slot but, no pretend coins included. One can use real coins or add a set. Slot will fit quarter size on down.<br /><br />Definitely entertaining.. unique as they come, and unlike any I've seen. An ATM idea with plenty of extras. Would be a fun gift- with a few quirks to overcome..!! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

Especially if used with younger children- The numbered 1-10 digits can help with counting, sorting, odd/even, grouping, sets, simple math equations, etc.  from a little device that may be necessary.. Could be used in preschool setting alone- of course, the purpose is to be a fidget for those who needs.. it could just as easily be a device used to learn #'s in a fun way! An added caveat would be someone who struggles with OCD or need to follow patterns- pushed in order, odd numbers only, evens and so on..!!<br /><br />Love the bright primary colors- easy to assign one to individual user by using a color system. Easy to identify who's is who's for all involved.. If, you've ever worked with this age… This is a lifesaver!<br /><br />As for fidget itself- offers up that perfect button satisfaction that can be soothing and methodical.. similar sensation of bubble wrap but, without the popping noise!

Best way to disperse- is to steady hold trigger for x20-30 sec. bursts.. this offers up a yard full of bubbles just that easy! Not entirely silent you should expect a bit of noise- but nothing more than a child's toy motor.<br /><br />Instructions are included but it's all pretty self-explanatory.. Includes x2 bottles of bubble juice (pretty certain that's the scientific name!) Only, prior to connecting bubble concoction- you must insert batteries first.. Note: bubble gun NEEDS x4 AA as they're not included. Compartment is in handle and has a “SLIDE” door cover! I mention this bc, it can be a bit tricky to remove.. Also note, batteries stack/slide in x1 after the other.. two on each side. Once in place, remove lid/safety seal from bottle and attach.

Really well made with a smooth, silicone feel these glide and slide without becoming stuck or sporadic.

However, because design is so new and unique- they could possibly be a bit distracting in a classroom setting.. these may entice other kids- as they're just that cool! Tbh, I've LOVED playing with bc of its gyro effect. I actually got for my son who uses while gaming/tv watching. Otherwise, he destroys a pen cap soda pop top, button on throw pillow.. you get the idea!!<br /><br />Fits nicely in the hand with ergonomic grip.. monochromatic color is universal for boys/girls alike.. of any age!

One could hot glue x2 exact rabbits “sandwich/Oreo” style onto the same type dowel- creating a 3-D effect.

One could Hot glue onto skinner satin rope that is cut/knotted off long enough to slip over the head and make a pendant for a child.<br />4. Using a rougher twine.. hot glue back of these approx x8” apart to create a garland effect for mantle.<br />5. Paint/finish completely.. and sporadically lay flat down middle of dinner or serving table like pieces of confetti. Sprinkle a spring confetti in the same fashion.. to wow and bring home an Easter effect!<br />6.

Color coated cards have bright recognizable objects on front and the physical word spelled on back- selecting a card, begins the process.. spell the word/object on card. One can begin using worded side to recognize the letters/process.. and make their way to spelling word by seeing just object alone! A learning tool that can grow with you.<br /><br />Color coded wooden tiles are solidly finished. Ample sized letter print is easy to read and clever use of a wooden template for tile placement is a simple but fun way to engage kids!! Giving this a puzzle vibe makes it less like ‘school work/learning' and kids are more apt to jump in and try- they want to be part of the fun!<br /><br />I found in teaching basics to little ones- success is all in the approach!!

    "text": "Straightforward like photo-  no surprises.. a solid plastic casing made with quality to encompass an actual skateboard bearing! Bearing clips securely inside a circular cutout. Spinner approx. size of a key (minus the jump ring extension) for an ergonomic fit in hand and no added bulk in the pocket! Kudos to “built in” ring attachment.. it eliminates a break in connection and worry of sending twirling keys airborne!!<br /><br />If used for sensory/fidget purposes The attachment  allows you to have with at all times- either clipped on keys, backpack, lanyard, etc. No clicks or noises to distract  in classroom setting- besides the movement itself.. just something to be aware of/consider.<br /><br />Ordered for my teen son diagnosed with ADHD diagnosis- he loves to spin this as he's gaming/tv watching.. it will spare pen lids, soda tabs, that he usually finds to put excess energy into! it gets his endorsement.<br /><br />It's fun- new drivers love to twirl keys.. it's sort of a right of passage behavior! But, a fun perk for any.. Only angst I see is price- I'd buy if this included x2-3 or, if price cut in half seems more reasonable.. IMHO. Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone!",

    "text": "Perfect set to manipulate using a little trial/error to get a feel for their magnetic grip, angle tweaking.. even strength of hold when using more or less in connection!! There is a bit of problem solving, adapting and possible “rethinking” as you move along and maneuver thru your great masterpiece! Nothing overly frustrating- just subtle yet “solvable adjustments” that I appreciate from a learning aspect..!!<br /><br />Kids seem naturally drawn in by their bright colors and unique shapes.. this ample set allows for endless possibility- build big or multiple items! Plenty of pieces to use with siblings, friends or classmates. Ideal in an age appropriate classroom or daycare- I say this bc, pieces are just small enough to fit in mouth.. but, quirky in their shape so a tad harder to just spat out! Simply put- use common sense!<br /><br />Pieces feel well made with no leftover edges or debris.. These are great for playtime but, can transcend into science class for molecule building, atoms etc. or be a solid tool for math class as well. Visual for add or subtracting, pair making, equal parts, fraction to name a few. The #300 count has a far reach in this capacity! Storage bin is just the cherry on top- makes clean up a breeze and stores easily away!<br /><br />I recommend without hesitation… One of my favorite recent finds to serve many venues for the younger ones! An endorsement I don't give loosely- hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "Every kid loves a water balloon fight.. It's like a child's rite of passage into a higher realm! Only, Mama feels differently: ripped balloons from nozzle threads, sacrificing fingers when tying it off! Ha.. anyone else fall for the ‘nozzle hat' put on end of hose for easy fill.. all you got was wet! Top this off with a mess of colored debris to clean up.. aka- popped balloon shrapnel. Well, not anymore- here lies a solution!!<br /><br />Clam style orb magnetically held shut via a “flip top” middle. these fill best submerged underwater. Opened up.. just ‘cup catch' the water inside. It may sound tricky but it's not!! Hack: fill with slow trickle! With a closed seal orb like pursing the lips- create a small pucker opening in the seam. As you do- let water trickle into open pucker.. when done- relax the squeeze to seal it up! Note: orb usually fills up 1/2 - 2/3. and it is plenty! No worry about water level- these will still be effective just fine!<br /><br />A bit unsure- if orb was painful on contact.. it's not!! Tiny magnets set in silicone pop open with pressure/contact making it fun for young + old alike. Great option for a pool, summer bbq, beach day.. great b-day gift or activity. *Keep in mind # of participants bc, a set of x4 won't serve a lot of peep! *Best to plan for ea. player to have x2-3 to make a real go of a game! *Hack: if used in backyard or park- place a few h2o buckets out for refill stations. *Hack: assign a color that matches a balloon orb to individual player to help identify whose “balloons” are who's- and keep bickering between kids to a minimum!<br /><br />A respectable set sold at higher price point up front.. with multiple uses it will pay for itself in the end-  but the ease/convenience it brings is priceless.

    "text": "Everything in a young child's world can be fascinating.. their little minds are truly the sponges we say they are- so, I love to see toys and activities that promote the learning/fun combo.. Kudos! This is a set of 14 containers and x3 “tools” for manipulating content. Or, you can set those aside and use hands.. even add your own utensils. Options are endless and all have their own fun possibility about them!<br /><br />Note: this is a set of containers to add/hold your activity.. buyer is to provide content they want to fill these with! Something as pure as h2o- simple, cheap + easy! Or, create a sensory “set up” with a little more effort, energy and creativity- TrUst Me, whatever it is- provides equal fun and becomes the imagination station! (name we've assigned it in our house!)<br /><br />A few unique fillers: dried beans, elbow mac, split peas, rice (smooth pearl pilaf!) or mini stones for vase, rubber bb's for air soft gun, smoothed sea glass, 1” yarn nubs (aka: yarn inchworms!) coffee beans, granulated sugars a hit! Shred. coconut hair and our fav- tiny seed beads for jewelry making feels so cool!! I love you can use things around the house.. *Hack: grab snack bags and store items post play to reuse without waste for the next round and make for easier set up! Fill a shoebox with variety of bags or various options- makes process EASY!! Don't be afraid to fill all containers with same item and enjoy measure, pour, stir just the same. Store set with DIY add-on box together!<br /><br />*Seller an add-on “item kit” of fill items in storage containers would be awesome to offer as optional purchase! Until then- create your own! I included photos of a few quirky items we filled to give ideas!<br /><br />Added tools: measuring cups/spoons, ice cream scoop, ladle, suction syringe, shot syringe, whisk.. turkey baster. *Hack: a $1 store or kitchen drawer clean out can let you gain a few utensils that you keep with your kit.. it just adds extra fun and provides even more options. Along with work/focus on diff. skill sets.<br /><br />Made with integrity and solid quality in a well thought design.* Hack: Placing mat/containers inside a disposable lasagna pan keeps spills contained and clean up a breeze- keep pan with kit to reuse!! Ideal for home, preschool, daycare, gma's house.. perf. holiday gift- kids LOVE this.  After constant “no- don't” this is perfect outlet to throw caution and structure to the wind.. A laugh and learn for sure! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "5 stars for the efforts creating STEM products + ideas for the younger age- Kudos! We need to embrace stimulating the brain when it is so eager and willing to absorb! My Stanford grad/MD dad always said- toddlers are short.. not stupid!! Ohh, was he right- it just took having my own kiddos to admit it! All toys have their place- But I love reaching a little ones creativity, problem solving and question asking.. all to help boost confidence that build a foundation- ha! Just from playing with toys that have a dual purpose!<br /><br />This set of STEM cars is on track.. much smaller than expected- only I'm not sure what I thought?! I've included photos to show actual pieces of just what's inside.. “still in separate pieces state” not just the finished product. Seller this would be helpful to include in photos so it lets buyers know what to expect. Visual of size, materials, extent of build.<br /><br />X4 bases and 8 cardboard bodies lets kids choose. I felt these would be a thicker/more solid substance than thinner cardboard they are. So be sure you're aware. Building- our 33mo. old was a bit aggressive trying to connect board with wheel base and bent board at the notched cut out!! So, not foolproof- Assistance may be required to help success and keep from damaging depending on skill set. Doing so may prolong the overall life expectancy.<br /><br />Wheel bases is approx. 3.5” with cutout body sized to fit. I love hardware is brightly colored so its easy to see and identify.. and not lose! Tools are of hollow plastic which is on par with price.. no sharp edges and varied heads lets the prob solving begin! (If too difficult- set out matching tool/screws so to create success and be proud of results! Shss.. I won't tell if you don't!) Great you can tweak to fit where your child is at.<br />Some of the unknowns were bc no inside visuals provided- for $ you'll get a lot of mileage with several cars to build. Best used with assistance close by- not ideal in larger class bc may not withstand multiple kids and skill levels. Hoping info helps- sorry so long winded.. with no posted reviews yet, I wanted to be thorough for everyone!",

Brightly colored  will be easy to spot for even the littlest of participants.. not to mention bring a fun accent to spring Easter decor! Each egg contains a random “pull back and go” coupe style hatchback. Cars themselves vary in color and are universal for boy/girl alike.. (with one exception- x1 baby pink flowery mobile!) Nothing fancy or hot wheel level quality.. but, definitely has ability to makes kids happy until little car is lost or expired.<br /><br />Ideal to use for neighborhood, classroom, friend family hunt.. no worry of any food allergies or even messy melted foil chocolates! Having the ability to order and take with without any assembling is priced right on point under $15. Eggs can also be kept and refilled if desired so it adds to the return value.<br /><br />Arrived packed with care in one larger bag.. Just easy peasy all the way Around!

Perfect to include with a Valentine's Day card exchange- deeming your child the hit of the party!! After all.. one can only have so many confectionery conversation hearts! The key is these being Individually wrapped. Fits perf. into plastic egg for an Easter hunt- swap out foiled chocolates and icky jelly beans.. 100% safe way to avoid any food allergy issues!! A hit to use as party favors.. or add to treasure box in a classroom or doctors office- options are endless, all bc of individual wrappers!<br /><br />Although, a bit feminine in the overall concept- you'll receive approx. 1/2 resembling dinosaur shapes.. making them universal for boy/girls alike. Seems k-4th grades are the ones who find the allure with these toys!! In one box you'll have more than enough for a classroom count and even a handful left over.. for the price point, you can't beat it!<br /><br />Mochi are a squishy, pliable slime putty textured animal shape.. you can pull and twist yet, not rip apart. Like all slimes/putty- they attract every piece of lint, crumb or dirt they come in contact with.. a moms worst enemy, I know! However, warm soapy water brings these clean as new.. I suggest getting a box of “snack bags” to store in. This keeps them clean and fuzz free while not in use. Tbh, it would be ideal if packaged inside resealable jewelry ziplocs- seller take note! Set DOES include x1 bag to hold entire set.. but, just doesn't help if dispersed.<br /><br />A perfect option for multiple uses that it's a current fad- wouldn't hesitate to order again.. you get a lot of bang for your Buck and the coolness factor to go with it!!

    "text": "Creative and unique for in/outdoor activity! Very clever and easy to use.. it has ability to include any number of participants or just a single player- one could even team up to play!! Would make a great outdoor school activity or field trip add-on.. Even a fun birthday game activity as well.<br /><br />No strict rules to learn or apply.. just a light “roll” of the dice- whichever shape faces up is the one to try and locate! This is where you can vary the play.. everyone finds an item containing that shape.. Or, search till the first person finds and roll again! *varying the strategy allows you to control length of time per game. You could even choose the first to find 5 items- wins! Truly, there's no wrong way to play!!<br /><br />Some shapes may be harder to locate if played outdoors- ie. heart, star.. You can always prep area to set out a few items like you would for a treasure hunt.. Or, just encourage participants to be creative and use imagination!<br /><br />Ball is made of a Nerf type foam with a coated finish.. easy for any age to roll and maneuver. Water resistant so it's easy to wipe clean. Please see photo I included.. ours came with a tiny knick in the corner so, these aren't bulletproof!! (*def. keep far away from dogs- as I'm sure they'd  love to chew this apart!) Simple to pack up and take to a park, beach, anyplace you'd like.. Definitely makes a fun gift that can be enjoyed by many ages. Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "This is designed nicely for “on the go” use or car travel entertainment! I'm liking the carry-all capability with its lightweight design.. it holds all components securely inside and is so easy to transport, even toddlers can carry under their own device! When opened it can be a little tricky without a solid surface.. so I appreciate the interior trays edges help keep pieces from tipping or spilling out.<br /><br />Extra fun with dual sided option- white board or magnet. Smart thinking to have both sides capable to withstand the marker bc, some kids don't always realize they can't write freely on either board! White board is stainable.. so you need to wipe off after every use! Definitely a cheaper version of material.<br /><br />The other angst is the quality of plastic letter/# casings- these are a far thinner and cheaper version of the official letter magnet sets. No worry these will do their job, but they lack a better quality about them. *Also note: you get just x1 of ea. letter.. so, spelling words can be hard! It would also be nice to include x2-3 markers! Varied colors are fun and would prolong playtime. One can add a few extras to the set is desired- either magnets or markers alike.<br /><br />A fun activity kids seem to enjoy- ours thinks it's a “laptop” just like his dads! Could be a cheaper gift option to take or keep at grandmas house.. “A leave in car toy” to use in waiting rooms, sibling ball games or traveling etc. Hoping info. helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:9f67bc80308d29f2e6d08db92facd127]] Wow! STEM introduced at a young age.. I love that! These softer sided silicone containers are fun for the kids and seem to entertain and keep them interested- unique color changing features and various pour abilities is fun and exciting.. However, just don't expect the working science lab like we did!<br /><br />The silicone material is quite pliable and loses shape under the weight of water.. it also can undo grip on wall suction. Each “cup” should have x2 suctions to hold it in place- but, x2 of our cups were missing x1 of their built in suctions- basically rendering useless on the wall!! As you see in my photos- I've shown the errors and how we had to shift to the tubs edge. *Another fyi- these do not like to stick on porous tile.. but  stick to solid porcelain fine.<br /><br />Another angst we encountered- x2 “cups” were also missing the open hole to insert the included habitrail tubing! It has a nozzle nub present where hole should be.. but, opening is sealed shut. All rendering set up shown in instructions- obsolete!! Yep! We were dead in the water- (pun intended!) bc the main feature that starts the process of connections was sealed over with silicone!? I admit, it was a bit of a let down.. that quickly went away when just used for tub fun. Hoping it's a fluke that set we have is flawed.. otherwise, it's entertaining and hits a lot of fun features kids like with water play: pouring, measuring, bubble concocting, water fall tubes etc.. tbh, mine used tube to blow bubbles in water creating a Jacuzzi effect!

    "text": "A great way for kids to feel super cool with a unique valentine option to share with classmates at the annul Valentine exchange! What kiddo doesn't have fun with a glow stick.. and created into a ring is a fun way to enjoy. A nice alternative to “conversation hearts, or melted chocolate” Ha.. and no allergy concerns either!!<br /><br />Parents will love set is all inclusive and easy to assemble.. cards come scored with cut that holds ring really well- no tape etc needed. Mini glow stick just slides inside ring to be activated by recipient.. bc of the awkward shape (ring pushed thru the card!) no envelopes are needed nor included. Set of 30 total- x5 of each design.. and bag of random color sticks along with x30 rings. To assemble + sign will take under 10min.. it's that easy!<br /><br />*Note: glow stick only slides in one end- the other side is too small to fit and it should easily inserts. IF, it won't fit.. just flip it around as you have the wrong end!! If it sounds confusing- trust me, it's not. It's made this way so stick won't slide out the other side! *Don't activate stick as they only lasts approx. 12hrs. and will be spent before received! Only downside I see- rings are one size.. and may not fit everyone.<br /><br />**I've included up close pic's to show what/how rings come together! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "Solid developmental tool for children's overall growth. A great way to add variety to child's playroom or backyard.. very unique! But, these are also ideal as an aid for one that struggles with developmental delays or physical limitations. Having different activities to improve and enhance skills creates growth by use in repetition.. and this hits the mark!<br /><br />Best of all.. item is sturdy, stable and made with integrity. A thicker upturned bucket style stool is topped with rubberized grips and designed with a wider base for structural stability. Rounded grips arent  obnoxious or uncomfortable and can be easily tolerated barefoot! Although not heavy- these have more of a substantial weight, helping them stay put. The included carry bag makes set very transportable- very easy to load and go! A great item to take to a park, gym, beach etc. or store in bag for easy cleanup when not in use.<br /><br />Using rope/connectors option, one can still adjust amount of space desired between steps. All mechanics run underneath and completely out of the way once set. Full instructions included for easy assembly. Materials 100% waterproof and simple to clean. Bright fun colors are exciting and can perk up a space if choosing to leave out permanently. Could also stack these in a corner for convenience .. and still look good doing so!<br /><br />A solid and unique developmental toy for kids to grow with.. built to last and be used by many of little peep! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

A great option in classroom/Sunday school to avoid food allergy concerns ..BUT, make no mistake- these are also ideal for a Valentine exchange! Nothing on wrapper states otherwise.. in fact, we're using for valentine party! Would also be a great birthday party favor or toy treasure box surprise- as these will stay securely sealed.<br /><br />X12 jumbo sized “gum ball machine” style encasements that open thru middle. Grateful these are prefilled/sealed- thank you!! Holds generic lego style blocks that clip together making: x3 individual items or x1 connected structure. Includes step by step instructions using visuals and this is vital.. I ordered a set in past that was a total bust bc, it didn't have instructions. Note: These will arrive ready to go.. So, you're also paying for convenience!<br /><br />Pieces are quite easy to connect and create a fun activity of x10-20min build time just depending on age. Best for 6-10yr. to independently construct OR, any age with parental help. (makes a fun throwback for any who love little cars/Lego building.. My 20yr. son who grew up lego mania -had fun resorting to childhood mem.'s when putting together!)<br /><br />Overall, a great find with a plethora of options for use and better yet, these come ready to go!

    "text": "Clever and all inclusive DIY craft made to let little ones embrace their creativity and paint away with a fun activity! I find this a total lifesaver during the wet weather!! Keeping a 3yr old. cooped inside isn't easy- but in the height of flu/rsv season it's a must in freezing Utah winter. It's also important to note: this activity could be shared by a few- or even provide more than a single day of painting entertainment!<br /><br />X3 small ceramic pieces and x2 brushes can be enjoyed however one decides.. Ha! Resealable flip top paint lids let one easily close up for later date. (I do wish it had x3 brushes.. x1 for each ceramic piece included.. if you have an extra brush from home, it will work no prob.!) Ceramics vary in their detail as, a child can paint extra's onto these OR, simply paint over the etched design and keep it easy. There's simply no wrong way.. and results are awesome however it's done!<br /><br />Only thing missing is a protective cloth to paint on. I suggest a vinyl or plastic placemat, flattened paper bag, etc. to cover surface-  and play clothes! Paint may stain certain fabrics. But, no prob washing off kiddos with just warm soapy water.. Ha! That's even including a bit of paint in the hair!<br /><br />***Two easy tricks I found and wanted to share:<br />Hack 1: separate the paints into pairs of 2- it makes it easier to use without all tipping over.. scissors separate the plastic letting you make these into x3 sets of two.. and its easier to share!!<br />Hack 2: use wax paper over the counter for a no muss/no fuss way to keep mess contained and provide EASY clean up!!<br /><br />A great gift or rainy day project.. and a fun activity to use imagination, creativity and simple skills. At the end of the day who doesn't love to paint! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:29a2591cf9a49c87ba97d6d44a4f0bdb]] One of the best fidgets ever found.. and listing is the only one seen for this particular style! Comes in a rock solid carrying case with a zip pull to maneuver + interior strap to hold securely in place. Ideal if you have one that loses everything.. this provides perf. place to store and put away!! Also nice if used by an adult- easy to slide inside bag + transport back/forth.<br /><br />The pair of textured circular balls fit in adult size palm and are tethered together for a “slip maneuver ability..” these roll one around the other.. with a creature comfort vibe that is both monotonous + methodical! (don't expect a pair of x2 fidgets as this is all just x1 mechanism!)<br /><br />Fidget isn't silent but has a simple clicking rhythm. Nothing I find annoying, obnoxious or irritating- but more of an added soothing feel to the overall sensory aspect! Watch video included to hear sound and see how these rotate.. *I mention bc, if in a classroom it's important not to cause any added distraction for those sitting around the user!<br /><br />The added massage quirk..?!!.. it feels good rolled along a neck or back- or even palm of hand! Just not sure a fidget would/should double as a massage device if any real merit!?<br /><br />This is a great overall feel and find- mine loves it and I myself see for the first time how an item like this could actually be rather enjoyable!! Total quality in every aspect.. it gets 5 stars for certain. Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "Boxed separately, this is either a set of four for one recipient… Or x4 individual items- the choice is yours!! Really well made with a smooth, silicon feel these glide and slide without becoming stuck or sporadic. However, there is a slight noise as the rubber “rubs” against the other piece- some may not notice or care.. yet, they could possibly be distracting in a classroom setting.. most likely because they're so unique and cool!!<br /><br />These fit in the hand with a nice ergonomic grip... Colors are very fun and even entertaining when designs are made by twisting interior pieces. Bc, of this feature- it could be bit of distraction to watch vs. just doing the methodical motion. The reality is- fidgets are helpful to those who need.. usually after the new wears off x1-2 days, they just do their job for a person. I will say this is FAR LESS chaotic and distracting than fidget spinner<br /><br />Made of a solid material and matching quality it is sold in that same capacity- these have plenty of merit..  I'm completely happy with the order. VERY UNIQUE and fun for anyone to fidget with. Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone!",

    "text": "X3 wooden puzzles priced under $15. It's a respectable price for the puzzle set. Actually thinner and therefore, lighter weight than others I've used in the past, they maneuver and pack up easy. Surprisingly, nothing feels flimsy or weak.. each piece has small wooden peg to remove and replace pieces as played with. Best of all.. puzzles create a fun way to learn numbers, colors, counting, shapes and sea creatures.. all without sitting down to “learn” on purpose- and that's the best kind!! Kids soak it up every time!<br /><br />I do wish these pieces were created with magnetic hold to keep firmly in place when not in use.. these will need a jumbo size ziploc to hold all x3 together in cupboard so not to lose pieces.. as there is no included storage option for them!<br /><br />Puzzles themselves have smooth finished edges.. no wood splinters and wood feels sealed- easy to wipe off with a cleaning wipe.. it should withstand that amount of minimal moisture no prob.! Colors are fun and shapes easily identified.. Great gift option or addition to preschool, playroom, daycare or grandmas house- options our endless! Perfect for ages 2 and up.. these will last for many kids to play if cared for- who doesn't love that! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

Only for some reason, pedal doesn't respond every time like it should!! (Yes! battery is full when trying it- yet 15% of time it wont respond electronically- reason deducted x1 star!!?) When pedal engages- scooter is stable, easy to glide and maneuver.. and enjoyed. Battery outlasts our toddler whose rides for 15-25min straight and it hasn't run out! (For reference: our little is 33mo, 36lb, 38” tall.. almost 3yr old.)<br /><br />because of electronic component- ours struggles to grasp concept without using the pedal since he's learned to ride with the electronic aid!  So, when it fails to respond or we have pedal off- he just “jerks” scooter back/forth and side/side- its as if he's trying to get it to do what it “should..” by tugging it into motion. For some reason.. he doesn't naturally get moving scooter without electronic help so, it can leaves him fristrated.<br /><br />Instructions are straightforward and connecting handle atop the scooter can be a tad tricky and tight.. Best if use included hardware to connect all screws loosely first THEN, tighten after all parts are aligned. Light up wheels are just extra!!! Not needed and not sure how long they'll last esp. rider encountered water elements? I love the “long press” music feature- ha, it's my fav. **bc, It shuts music all the way off!!<br /><br />We've only used inside on tile and large smooth nape rug. No tire markings is nice.. I like inside option bc it's winter here! I realize some issues had may be caused by our rider himself- but feel pedal should not be a problem we have to deal with if it's charged.

There is no “wrong way..” A user can find their pattern with any of these type devices.. it's what I appreciate most about this style- This brings an ability to shift, click, wiggle and glide however it's best soothing to you!! Basically, it's a way of making it personal… The only downside- is the crinkle!!! Its a snap, crackle, pop of noise that would be disruptive and distracting to others around.. So, I do not recommend in a class type setting!!<br /><br />Ordering the “brick” also offers a sensory satisfaction for those who like to physically trace the outline of the raised connectors- tbh, Im not certain why some feel this shape is automatically able to connect to a building set of similar blocks? Bc, It doesn't.. and should be noted as such!!<br /><br />Now, the fact this splits in two is surprisingly fun… and for one whos trying it out for their son- it's been a lot of fun to play with! Far more enjoyable to a fidget, spinner, cube, or squish that are made as fidgets!  Priced higher bc it's made of quality materials.. I would deduct .5 stars if I could- But, because I can't and the fact you can make this so uniquely personal.. I gave it x5 stars! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

No attached game board or pieces, etc. 100% just the black shaped disc- and instructions (see photo included..) that's it!! very sturdy/firm and easy to take with you.. ANYWHERE!! Simple slip in your bag to happy hour or impromptu party- dorm room, neighbors house.. it's to sit atop a cup, mug, bottle making it a bit sticky! Good news is- washes/wipes off with soapy water no prob.!<br /><br />Rules are NOT difficult to learn- IF, your players pay attention.. game is a simultaneous “movement..” Once you know THAT- you're home free!! I suggest informing rules and x1 practice round..(15min. give/take..) it will make a lot more sense for “those kind of gamers.. ha-ha!!”<br /><br />Up/running: all positive feedback from our crew.. no one was bored and the quick pro quo is a great bonus to keep all engaged- any with fierce competitive edge will keep wanting to go another round.. trust me, it was me! Not much strategy just clever quick, thinking. Of course loser takes a swig makes it more interesting- but you can add any challenge if wanted/not.<br /><br />Great gift for an adult aged family or anyone who loves a fun add-on to Game collection. $15 price point makes easy + great gift or stocking stuffer!!

    "text": "Perfectly thought out to learn #'s 1-10 in triple form..!! This puzzle allows for use of: numeric symbol, actual spelling + dot counting- a trifecta of learning the basic ten!! The cherry on top is including the element of Identifying colors as well.. using primary and a few 2ndary outliers. Although it's just a matching of colors (without the written word) it teaches how to visually pair.<br /><br />Cute wooden “bubble style” lady bugs with corresponding # of dots.. will help teach the physical counting process- ha! It's a puzzle that keeps on giving!! All pieces are large enough not to fit into the mouth.. no matter how loud they are!! The 10 pieces will fit universally even if color match is incorrect.. can help learning simple dexterity!<br /><br />Why not 5 stars? A puzzle without magnetic components to self hold to a puzzle board.. needs a box or carry bag and this doesnt provide either. One must find box/Ziploc sized to store and keep from losing pieces.<br /><br />Also, some of painted ladybugs are a bit of a stretch for the color they represent!! For example, look at green- aka ladybug 4 that is not green!! It's an airy mint for all true purposes and although a shade of- it needs bold and distinct in green primary shade. Same with magenta/hot pink-aka ladybug 5.. board is colored appropriate but not the bug..as it looks red! Lastly, violet aka ladybug 9…this needs a bigger variation from the purple- most likely, purple should be much darker but, you get the idea!<br /><br />Listing the flaws is not a dealbreaker!! Rather a solid understanding of what you'll receive. Made of wood and if cared/stored properly.. this is one that could last through child rearing years! A great gift for any.. could be used in a daycare, preschool, playroom etc- it draws attention for certain. $16 is a respectable price point and one we'll get plenty of use from.

    "text": "Wow!! In theory, a fabulous idea- playing a game created 4000yr. ago is  almost hallowed experience! Regardless of how captivating.. that one sheer fact brings an elevated element to playing. One we were happily anticipating.. only obstacles presented as we got underway..<br /><br />Most vital: Instructions are not clear.. and being complex that just can't happen!! (keep in mind-what life was 4k yrs. ago! This game transports you giving a taste of that exact experience.. it's noted by the simplicity of dice, pieces of leather/wood, even the drawings- it's really pretty wild!!) Simply put- instructions must be rectified. We found a way to learn via posted info. online.. that shouldn't ever happen in 2022..!!<br /><br />As for game components: perfectly fit into a cubed style tin. The velvet pouches hold/protect small wooden parts.. board is rolled up like scroll and held with a faux leather strap. All an authentic touch but also the reason the game board fails.. Pieces are cut from a very light wood which lets them slide off their mark easily. But, biggest struggle is in the board itself. While trying to offer an authentic replica they've created game board on a faux leather hide.. prob. is bc it's been rolled and stored as such- it wont lay flat! Arched without ability to correct and pieces sliding around.. they must find better solution.<br /><br />Definitely has merit and potential- if solid instructions were included that were simple to follow.. and pieces were better thought or stored differently- this could be five star for the experience alone. A unique game to have if fixes are put in place. Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",

Rules are straightforward to get across and not lose/confuse players in the process. (took about 3min. to explain and x1 practice round to seal the deal!) I included photo of the instructions above- see.. simple!<br /><br />No Skills Needed.. bc its a game of chance and luck- a child could win  and the phd. come in last! Only skill to master- spinning of “dreidel style” dice..!! Which is actually a really fun touch! The fact game can turn on a dime makes it more exciting and eager to go another round. As an avid gamer.. I'd never heard/played this classic before- and love when that happens.. adding a solid addition to the cupboard.<br /><br />*coins can be swapped for actual $ or candy.. a fun way to upped the ante..!! Definitely adds a fun twist.<br /><br />Best of all- for a higher price point.. you'll receive a game that lasts for decades. Total quality solid spinners and metal coins are that of game tokens- thick glass/stainless dish are solid as well.. and everything is protected by velvet pouches- packed into cube style embossed box! A small footprint is a bonus.. An ideal gift for any game enthusiast!! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

Has the weight of a zippo lighter in hand- just without the fun of flipping the lid! Small stature fits into any pocket so, easy to take on the go. Make no mistake- this will draw attention simply bc it's unique! (which may/not be ideal for kids in class setting if causes disruption!?)<br /><br />Universal in the fact- it's appropriate for younger or adult users alike.. not like many obnoxious bright colored fidgets that seem a bit juvenile! This is respectable and plays the part for any user- a perk bc, adults may also have a need to use as well!<br /><br />My issue with fidget- is its ability to fidget!! right out of box it took x2 hands to open/maneuver just to separate magnetic closure.. possibly tighten down too much or gear not oiled? Maybe it's normal and needs to be broken in.. So, I mention as some may lose the interest prior to fidget achieving its optimum function- definitely was not expecting this aspect. Im also a little disappointed in total range of motion.. thinking this had a figure 8 track to slide with thumb/click closure- it does NoT! This is all just personal preference for what “clicks” (no pun intended!) with the user.. A unique option that appears well-made with merit. But, at $17 price point I expect this to be ready to work!

Topics are universal/tasteful and appropriate for male/female alike. Basics: draw a prompt that's worded to help reflect and express a thought/feeling toward a meaningful question. Focus is on fundamentals you're after in a partnership- no right/wrong way to respond which can easily lead to free open dialogue.. something everybody could benefit from!<br /><br />Game is designed on a deck of cards and packed/stored as such. Deck is easy to slip into a bag for on the go use. One could take to happy hour, game night, road trip.. bestie's dorm room, etc. I chose for my daughter in college to play amongst roomies and her crew- after spotted playing “girls only..” the guys wanted to join! They've actually played all wknd- and what starts as gaming turns into some all inclusive socializing and discussion.. I'd say mission accomplished!!<br /><br />Giftable for any purpose.. regardless of relationship status! Thought provoking and could even be used solo as a journal entry topic. Simply a safe way to take inventory of your desires from any relationship.. whether its one failed in the past, currently in or a future search.",

Perfect option for one who needs in a car or classroom type setting.<br /><br />Easy to maneuver the “gearshift..” it was almost a little too loose. In case any user must have need to be in control of a pattern type maneuver. Moving this around, it may easily slide into a diff. socket while one is trying to repeat a specific or continued pattern in succession.. Something mine does!! ie, if he moves the gear up left/right to the top- he must repeat right/left going down.. (hence what I mean by pattern! bc this slides so freely- it can frustrate if slips to ‘the wrong slot.' It made us create the “oops” factor.. to help sooth him!) It's too precious- when using I hear a verbal “oops!” every few min. from the other room.. in a way that is progress for us!!<br /><br />At $11.99- it's a solidly made fidget with merit.. the black ring stand is a total bonus, it lets you set it down without rolling. Hack: this can also rest on upturned water bottle twist off lid.. (if band/stand is misplaced!) Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",

Built 100% compatible to use with “Thomas/Brio” brand as I have both and mixed in, it's hard to even tell brands apart. Some color variations but with all natural wood.. it's to be expected and natural for any wooden train! Note: perfectly smooth pieces- NO rough edge or splinters 100% kid friendly!<br /><br />So much detail in the accessories- DanG! Helicopter is to die for with spinning rotor..and “Space Station Center” which is heart of the figure 8.. brings the fun unique shape. All so amazing bc entire set is UNDER $20..!! One of best deals I've seen in quality of train paraphernalia- EVER! (you just get mind around.. a train in outer space!?)<br /><br />Keep box with picture for easy “replica” build. But, remember a train track is imagination play- there's no wrong way to build. Skies the limit.. ha! (bc of the space theme!!) 2yr old can connect pieces but needs adult help creating a track. Keeps ours self entertained for 20-30min at a time.. priceless!<br /><br />Awesome gift idea for boy/girl alike..I dont hesitate to recommend as its just that perfect!

Cubes can store pristine forever or set out on display for just the occasion. We have x3 cubes on dinner table now.. various topics depending on company we're with! Loving to add “Inspiring Women” cube- especially with x2 daughters.<br /><br />FYI- these can be conversation starters or a game played that nobody wins! With this you answer x1 card each person.. or move in a circle asking the same question of everyone and then repeating process with a new card. The term game is used loosely.. Each card presents a question on x1 side and a relatable person/reason  on the other side. Ex. What's favorite music? Flip side will feature an artist and some reflective fact of the question. “Topics” vary by cube you have- this happens to be inspiring women- so all featured cards are women!!<br /><br />Made for “young girls” is a stretch. This is geared to young adult and up.. any gender can play!! Bc those featured are women excludes no one! Time played is up to user- as many cards read as desired.. a nice feature to control the time. Questions are quality and from basic to thinking, morals to character- how deep you open up is players choice! Nothing is vulgar or inappropriate.<br /><br />A solid gift or addition to game closet.. sending our box back to college dorm with our daughter next semester- hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.",

I chose for my 19yr. old Lego-lover bc you're never too old to build.. especially at xmas time!! If given to appropriate age- this can be a fun 5-15min. activity.

Buttons on front are pretend.. and timer twists making a clicking noise to simulate action. Toast lever on the side is what puts this into play and similar to a wind up toy- it runs a little buzzing or percolating noise.. and pop!! Toast is done!<br /><br />Overall construction is stable, lightweight. Nothing fancy and very compatible with younger toddlers… something that can grow as younger children transition from to being entertained by a toaster- Who then use it in imagination kitchen play!<br /><br />No fancy lights, whistles or bells! However, no need for batteries either!! As so many toys need to be plugged in and charged these days- it's nice to take a motor back to old school simplicity.. Size is small to carry or move around- (see up close pics of details above!) Toast is a firm plastic.. not foam to rip over time. **don't push into action by pressing on the toast- use the lever..otherwise, this can jam or break and stop working!! It happened to us but we got lucky to finagle it back on track.. whew!! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

I suggest wetting ball prior to play- it creates a grabbier fabric grip on what is smooth exterior. 1/3 smaller then standard football- its perfect for big/smaller players to get a solid hold.. and double laces help too! Wetting also puts perf. amount of weight on such a light ball to let you throw with solid accuracy. Hey, if playing at pool or beach.. its all about bragging rights!<br /><br />Looks quirky on arrival- like a deflated balloon in a sock! Includes a pump (its ehh, but works!) let's you fill and play within minutes. Note: bc ball may lose pressure in heat/water bring the pump in case ball needs top off of air! Extra Note: if difficult to get a firm grip- expel some air for a better hold.. ”Tom Brady deflate-agate” mentality.. difference is you wont be in any trouble! A helpful tip for tiny hands having slip-grip issues!!<br /><br />Needle is included. Note: dip in wax/chapstick prior to inserting will help secure a non leaking plug!!! (trick works on any ball- you're welcome!)<br /><br />Bright colors are easy to spot if overthrown or in bushes.. has respectable craftsmanship. Nothing is loose or sloppy. Bonus set of x2 balls for $16- keep x1 and gift the other.. would make any happy to receive. A solid way to add fun for all ages to your outdoor fun.. hoping info helps your decision- stay safe everyone.",

Weighs nothing and wiggles without effort- I appreciate it's not slippery or hard to hold.. keeps mom from retrieving over/over if infant drops easily!<br /><br />Even the cupping sound is methodical! Sort of like a quiet clop-clop of horses hooves.. it's fun to maneuver and create the noise. Nothing loud as it's really only heard by user- another perk for mom!<br /><br />Bright colors grab a child's attention.. and the fact you receive x2 for under $10- is a total deal! Twisted and manipulated in all directions we've had zero concern of breakage.. and no bigger than an adult size hand it's easy to slip into diaper bag or toy box. Easy to store away or take on the go!<br /><br />Choosing rainbow variation- we've practiced and identifying these as we play.. our 30mo old can point out any primary color with accuracy found on inch worm!! Makes a great addition to your toy collection or a fun gift to give. Each comes in their own individual box and can easily be spilt up for x2 recipients. Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone!",

Can also be used year round- not just for Halloween..!!<br /><br />Best part- these become a full cosplay costume by accessorizing! NO changing clothes is needed.. costume are add-ons with any outfit worn to create the finished look!! You can become a superhero in anything- school uniform, play clothes, PJs etc..??  Vvc<br /><br />Note: set includes 4 capes and 8 masks.. capes are reversible and have a varied superhero insignia on each side (8 options in total.)<br /><br />Perfect for family with kids, or a party.. even fun in classroom or theatre group, daycare and yesss.. the Halloween costume! These make a great gift for kids who love dress up and imagination play!<br /><br />$18- is respectable for nicely made capes with adjustable Velcro to fit various sizes. I do wish this had a bit longer strip of velcro to fit a wider range. I can easily secure around 30 mo. old- but it does gape at neck.. longer strip of velcro could tighten for smaller child!! Masks have thicker elastic to hold in place- a bit irritating at edges/eye sockets due to felt fabric and awkward angles. Best for 3yr and up bc of fit. Length is perfect- as grownup- I can play too by wearing cape on looser fitting! Hoping info helps your decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "A great way to expel excess energy.. kids tend to love the motion of rocking or bouncing- and fact this is done easily under their own merit.. is nice for you and healthy for them. They enjoy being in motion and ultimately can tire themselves out in a manner of speaking! Sort of like peddling a bike around- nothing excessive.. but can actually help disperse pent up energy- What mama wouldnt love that!!?<br /><br />We used electric pump to fill and cant imagine how long/rigorous a process it would have been to fill with tiny hand pump! This takes far more air than you'd expect.. zebra took shape quickly- then, it must FILL UP- A LOT. If not, it's obsolete of its purpose. Best way to know if full to its capacity- ears will not bend down!!! Trust me- it took over x3 tries to get it right. Blowup should barely indent under full body pressure.. Once complete, it's easy to zip closed. See photos included.<br /><br />We used puppy leash to make reigns for our little guy to hold onto.. it helped 2yr old stabilize a lot. But they can also freely hold onto neck, head, ears!<br /><br />Deducted x1 star bc it states toy fits 18mo-7yr old. Not even close.. if this fit much past 3yr old in size I'd be surprised! In order to create bouncing motion the legs hang off sides and feet hit just at the floor to let child push off. If a 2yr. old is ideal height to maneuver.. anyone bigger may struggle to do so!! Something to keep in mind when ordering.. Toys like this are made in different sizes.. best to choose one appropriate to fit proper size dimensions vs. base choice off of the ages listed.<br /><br />Overall.. plenty of fun for $25- the fact it lets a little one use independence and exercise is a bonus! Feels solid without concern of bursting and cute and unique as a gift for self or others- hoping info can help your decision.. stay safe everyone!",

    "text": "Perfect little balance bike.. made without grease or components to dirty or stain indoors. No black rubber tires to markup  floors. This is ideal for indoor use- which was our intended purpose! With age and coordination needed.. I found it safer to ride on indoor floor vs. outside pavement!<br /><br />Easy to assemble- x2 pieces connect to mount the seat.. no tools required as this securely clips into place by sliding metal pin into pipe with a pre-cut hole. Easy to follow instructions are just as simple and straightforward. Note: seat does NOT adjust and CANNOT be raised/lowered. Light weight and easy to maneuver, if supervised I had no concern bike was too heavy or cumbersome for toddler.<br /><br />Reason for deducting x1 star: balance bike is consistent with toddlers capability and age listed at 12-24mo. However, bike size for a body that age is just FAR TOO SMALL!! We ordered for 18mo. old in the 52% for size.. precisely smack average for recommended user. Only seat to floor measurement was far too low- Only way to use is drag toe of shoe as you push.. or, fan legs out in awkward circles so not to catch on floor. I believe cognitive balance is on point with this age- So, unfortunate the seat doesn't match the average size child.. *This definitely doesn't provide any room to grow.. Not without ability to adjust seat height!<br /><br />Overall structure is solid showing quality control with an easy build.. Could be a fun addition for developmental skills.. Would even make a great gift. Just keep in mind- seat to floor fit is SHORT! Making this best for younger/smaller toddlers if they can manage balance skills.

    "text": "Ordering a sz. 3 soccer ball is best suited for a younger foot- one who's strength of contact is far less aggressive on impact. Used in this capacity- this ball is on point. However, If ball is used by someone with a much heftier strike.. you may notice it starting to lose its psi (inflated air is seeping out!)<br /><br />The overall integrity seems present.. no sign of poor quality or craftsmanship. Set includes a needle, pump and carry net- a net that can also provide single person practice.(google any online video to see how this is done using net/bag. It can help player with touches on the ball-eliminating having to shag it down after every hit!)<br /><br />If losing air- most likely culprit is the plug. HACK: a tiny bit of wax atop plug prior to pumping with a wax dipped needle (needle still has smooth entry.) Wax can help create an extra “barrier” to seal any escaping air. We do this with all our balls- so far no issues.. **it should be noted we use a sz.3 for shooting drills with a 4-5yr old players! Ball had merit to keep the psi level no prob.!!<br /><br />One must also realize.. this may leak air through stitching from an older players strong impact- if this is the case..the most simple resolve is to size up to a sz. 4 or 5. If used as intended.. Zoojoy ball provides a quality option! Hoping info can help your decision- stay safe everyone.",

This is a perfect set to give as a “throwback” to any who enjoyed the toys the first time around..<br /><br />Used as a fun “dresser treasure or fidget toy..” At $39 pk. it includes 8 total in 3 diff. size and style variations.. with x2 of them lighting up (a new feature since we've purchased them over a decade ago.. !) Each ball comes with their “iconic coin..”<br /><br />Definitely a solid mix for those active in the game or wanting a throw back down memory lane! Pricey like most of these crazy trends are.

    "text": "Just as headline reads a game with total potential!! Not sure why any product hoping to takeoff would cut unnecessary corners? ie. No timer… instead use your device?? Ugh, my pet peeve with game night is players distracted by cell phone during play and here you've asked us to bring in the enemy?! I cant suggest enough to add a sand timer- take out distraction! (Something you shouldnt have to do with new purchase!) While we're at it, get real wipe-off markers, bc included are subpar and don't like to erase!! A bottle of cleaner will help cards not stain- but it's optional.. See, why we shouldn't cut corners?! This is FUN- concept is there and a lot of laughs to be had… (just fix the issues like this!!)<br /><br />Who can play: x3 or more players is best- otherwise you have “an old maid conundrum!” You know if 2 play and if you don't have maid.. the other does!! This is, if I vote for mine- and you vote yours.. we're always in a tie. X3+ players fixes that! We did play teams- IT WAS A RIOT!! Game can adjust like that. Age is teen/adult- younger wont understand abvr. concept.. you could team little with adult if needed but, prob. wont hold interest in the same way as others.<br /><br />Game in play: instructions are unique- some steps easier to follow than others.. however, this is also a game strategy of common sense! We made our own set of rules that mimic original.. we took the gist and added simple where it became confusing. ie, we set pt. system by #'s of 10 scale and tossed out the offered idea. We also decided- first one to specified #..wins! This lets you control time less or more. We added bonus letters: Q,Z,X gave double pts. if you won round- which is a fun twist. Don't get me wrong you can use the rules including just be sure all players listen up during explanation..<br /><br />A game mine really liked despite its shortcomings. Seller take note these are easily fixed.. you'd have a winner on your hands! As a family group text we always send snaps of unique license plates we see.. so for us, we find fun in the idea pregame! A concept completely unique to this game- tbh, I'd rate board/user friendly a 2.5 and fun had a 5 star!! Something to keep in mind when ordering..

    "text": "Definitely an item that requires a little patience and a lot of common sense! With not a lot of hardware to assemble.. this can logistically be a bit tricky. In an attempt to keep storage to a small footprint they do an amazing job condensing the length of poles condense into a carry-on bag! The angst is- it comes at a cost of having to then assemble x3 pieces into making x1 pole for each corner. Might I add.. x3 very tight fitting pieces that get connected with screw + nut wing!<br /><br />I find in typing this out it becomes a bit wordy and info. may be lost in translation. So, I went ahead and included photos of a few sketches I drew along with descriptions-hoping they'll help to understand the process!!? Yessss- this includes an instruction booklet.. only, it's a bit confusing at best!<br /><br />Just think- x4 poles are broken into x3 parts.. each needs to be assembled with the hardware to slide in one of the four corner slots. Once x4 poles have been built.. and secured in canvas cover- place x4 rubber stoppers/feet on bottom. Use ballast to keep poles from tipping once erect.. string lights on interior/exterior. *One can utilize interior pocket to hold the small battery pack.. (I find it's a good starting point for the lights and work from there!) also remember lights are 100% optional and can be used in any capacity! Last step: place bottom floor mat inside.. and BooM!! A teepee is born!<br /><br />*store carry bag till disassembled.. One can also “squish up“ like an umbrella and lean in a corner.. keep lights/ballast in interior pocket. Keep secured  with a ribbon, velcro or bungee cord (roll mat separately like you would a yoga mat..) Ha! Storing in this capacity eliminates rebuild every time!<br /><br />Overall, a fun addition kids absolutely love… It's their own private hideaway! We set up and left in playroom corner bc it's enjoyed so much! Made for 1-2 small toddler/children. Sturdy when complete but.. not bulldozer proof- so just be kind!<br /><br />Hoping info provides help to clear up some of the confusion! Live and learn.. and pass it on!! Stay safe everyone.",

How great for him to cosplay and mimic what he sees mama dressing for on her workdays- after all, this is how kiddos learn so much! 100% universal for boy/girl.. along with fact, the costume can be a “doctor OR nurse” as it's not limited or stereo typed (an appropriate aspect this offers without even trying!!)<br /><br />For 33”, 28lb. 2yr. old we chose 3-4T. Tbh, fit was great with ample room- remember, its a costume and not made with a lot of fitted detail!! I expect this may also get slipped on over something else while kids are playing.. So, if uncertain of size- go up! Length can always be rolled and rest of its fit is simple including elastic waist.<br /><br />Accessories are so fun! A few have built in LED light and the shot is a big hit! But best is the working stethoscope.. one can actually hear their own heartbeat- so amazing! Glasses are adorable- but hard to keep on.. and the tiny mask is to die for! Only dislike in this entire set is the “medical bag.” Made of a thin soft synthetic cloth with plastic handle- it's a bit hard to fit all pieces (especially if 2-3yo loads it up!) *Hack: we got a black insulated lunch pack that is perfect! This holds its shape, has ample room.. and flip top zip lid lets little one load or locate the bags content- an easy fix if other rips or annoys.<br /><br />Great set! Makes a great gift at a solid price of $20. Hoping info can help make your decision.. stay safe everyone.",

However, we found this tube has limitations to be aware of-<br /><br />Size of tube is smaller then other “adult” versions. Those 4” DO make a difference. Best for teens or smaller adults.. our 6'5” 190lb son couldn't use this at all!!! But, our 5'11” 190lb. struggled as well.. just to give perspective. I used- 5'2” 148lb.. I fit fine!<br /><br />Tube has climb rope- but, not made to support the full weight of user.. neither is pillow! These can actually separate and rip a hole at the seam where rope or pillow attach.. if tossed off tube, try to gain lift by a secondary option and not just the rope alone. Rope does hold nicely if used to tether other tubes together.. we had 6 total and it did fine.<br /><br />Cup holder is adequate width but not very deep! 20 ounce twist top was vulnerable to falling out so we had to wedge it in to stay put!<br /><br />Made for natural water.. this is best used without rapids, rocks or tree debris!! All river tubes are vulnerable to sharp objects- however, we ended with a fatal “PoP” in this on the last bend.. Other riders using Sunlight Sport “American River Blazer”  brand.. hit same large smooth boulder jetting out of surface and pushed off- this tube met its fate on the impact.. So, yesss!! differences in tube strength matter- this seems to has less vs. more.. Note: we did have rip in pillow seam but it's not connected to main air bladder- helpful if it stayed afloat less the headrest.. but, we managed to blow this out x2!<br /><br />Overall, sized appropriately and not strained.. this can float in lake or calm river. Anyplace else, it has a higher risk of leaving you up a creek without a paddle… Or should I say tube ha ha!! Things to consider when making your decision- hoping they can help.. stay safe everyone!",

But mostly bc it takes a solid, steady, coordinated hand to align the driver blade.. into screw slat!! I do wish this was made “kid friendly” with a deeper or even hidden magnetic pull. Something for littles to have more success without becoming frustrated- ours grasps the concept just not able to keep it aligned to turn.. I also wish it had a few more tools- even duplicates so it could be shared with siblings or a play date… this provides x1 wrench, x1 screwdriver.<br /><br />Matted colors are very universal and solid wood is a value at an $18 price point.. Edges are finished and smooth- no snags or splinters. Little wooden box is nice but would be ideal to have some sort of lid of flip top to contain.. help to keep pieces together better! (just wishful thinking from my mom!)<br /><br />For any of those not capable enough to create something out of nothing- the toy can fall a little flat.. But, if redirected to help “fix things..” a child can busy themselves for quite a while walking around with a screwdriver to put into cupboard cracks or vent slats.. this is how ours has found success until he can grow into the coordination needed.<br /><br />Aged appropriately this would be a nice gift for either boy/girl.. it can stimulate fine motor skills and a lot of creativity.

    "title": "Fun pretend play.. quality mixed with a few cheap pieces!",
    "text": "Love this idea.. crazy as it sounds it's a great way to introduce being a little helper and cognizant of the messes that must be cleaned up! Our little guy loves to mimic whatever we do.. and it includes cleaning! He follows behind with his broom, mop of feather duster.. Oh, and his spray bottle! (Yes, it actually sprays but the little hands have minimal skill to make much of a spritz!) These were the hit items for us.. I've included up close photos showing details so you can see their overall integrity.<br /><br />The broom, mop, duster, spray bottle, dust pan and carrier… all are quite decent and what you'd expect for a solid toy.<br /><br />The cloth, sponges + product bottles with lids that detach.. are sweet but not so much made of quality and the squeegee is pretty useless bc it's so thin and bendable. “Chore chart” and stickers were no use.. it came rolled up where most stickers pulled off the protective sheet- doesn't affect the toys but in case it matters.<br /><br />Overall.. a fun concept for pretend play and sized appropriately. Nothing too big, bulky- or heavy! A little pricey for a few items not of solid quality.. Made to be enjoyed by boys/girls alike- could make a small gift.. addition to a playroom.. or preschool. Hoping this info helps make your decision- stay safe everyone!",

    "text": "Ordered for my daughter spending her summer involved in an internship program with a group of students she hasn't met.. Only the fact she is both living and working side-by-side with this new faces.. created an awkward 24/7 togetherness!! A far easier situation to navigate once they've had a chance getting to know each other!<br /><br />Spill the tea was a very fun, safe and successful way to create conversation.. only it's perfect that it's done in a way to involve everyone and didn't leave one person interrogating another- it sort of gives “permission” or the ok to ask all sorts of things to find out about personality etc. yet questions stay very appropriate.<br /><br />Categorized as a game- is a bit of a stretch! It's not about strategy or winning/losing.. and definitely more about getting to know the players you are with.. A perfect opportunity in her situation!<br /><br />After playing for a weekend.. 2 nights in a row- I'm told the efforts paid off! In fact, the stack of questions that didn't get asked were set out on the table and have been used to keep the process going during meals together!! A card presented as a “table topic” where each one takes a turn answering that same question… how perfect is that?! I love the fact they felt safe enough and also as if this game was truly a positive and getting to know each other… They decided to continue on their own- Definitely speaks to the validity of what you can learn about others. I would recommend as a solid ice breaker tool- and note: One can alter the playing rules and expectations however it fits their needs. Hoping this info can help make your decision.. stay safe everyone!",

    "text": "A great way for toddlers to grow and develop their cognitive learning.. (ideal for 18mo. and older) very creative way to introduce concepts by using fun and creativity. Designed to get a child's attention and peek their interest..<br /><br />Pictures of brightly colored cartoon objects found on the farm are used- different animals, people, machinery, etc.. Cards are cut in half some vertical, some horizontal and adhered to a sturdy cardboard to keep from bend/creasing. (i included photos to show the actual width-)<br /><br />BEST part of all..these are simple and straight edge connections!! NO notched puzzle edges to figure out and frustrate little beginners.. this is focused on visual recognition and stimulating thinking by finding a match and putting together successfully! No worries- kids will have plenty of time to move up the puzzle chain as they develop those skills.. This particular game offers younger ones exposure to something that is at their level- not always easy to find items for the beginning steps of learning.<br /><br />Would be a great addition to any home, preschool, daycare etc. would even make a great gift for a child. Comes in a flip top storage box to stack in a game cupboard. A solid find at $9.99-  Hoping this info. can help make your decision.. stay safe everyone!",

    "text": "Ordered the smaller set to pull off the perfect prank! These stepped up in a big way and we're a total success… Our daughter lives in college dorms and every end of year.. kids are tasked with the annual “Staff against Students” prank week..!!! So why not float some ducks in the featured campus fountain?! Totally harmless and to be enjoyed by all who pass by ha-ha…!! These were a big hit- and even photographed for school newspaper- mission accomplished!!!<br /><br />Ducks are small enough to swim in a small water fountain, pond, tub or pool and yet they're large enough not to enter the filtration system.. The fact these ducks are made with a variety of hats or hobbIes just added to the fun as something for everyone- even a few college majors! chef, artist, librarian, policeman, nerd, nurse, construction, beauty queen, surfer.. even a graduation cap duck!! Out of the 25- we had x3 doubles.. this wasn't a problem for our need but to some it may matter. (to be clear= 22 originals- 3 duplicates.)<br /><br />Do note: we did NOT receive the ducks shown in photos- Ad shows ducks made in every color.. only we got 25 YELLOW DUCKS- the only color variation was in their built in themed accessory or hat! This worked for our purpose but, if expecting various colors you may not receive that..?!<br /><br />Detail of each ducks features and accessories are there.. ie, ducks eye or beak- sunglasses, decretive  hats, etc- colors cross out on the lines- it isn't  sloppy but something expected with rubber toys like this.. the slight imperfections are definitely manageable. For $20 you get 25 ducks- definitely a better deal to spend $7 more and get 50 ducks for sure!<br /><br />These could be used for childs birthday, carnival, float in fishbowl margaritas, bathtub, pool.. what ever the need- keep in mind these do have a plug in bottom to keep air filled shape.. and water can infiltrate if compressed which can lead to mold overtime! Bc of this they're great for short term use and then discarded- hoping this info can help make  your decision.. stay safe everyone!",

With the integrity of built to last pieces- this will be around for your child to play until they grow out it.. I love that!! Expect smooth edge pieces with seamless connections and magnets inclosed + secure behind the scenes! LOVING the clip bucket “tool box” with carry handle- not too heavy/bulky so even a small child can carry. Case is made of high quality acrylic to hold and protect all the pieces inside.<br /><br />Loving this spans age gaps if there's a discrepancy at a play date or when its used amongst siblings.. the ability to create at any level and not affect one another is huge.. Ha! Very few toys can claim that!! As for size of set- I suggest to go big! A bigger set lets multiple peep enjoy at once without running out of pieces for master creations! Note: its also possible grow the collection as needed all just by adding a set- no worry, these will blend seamlessly.<br /><br />What to expect: set includes sticks, balls + bends.. I'd LOVE to see company expand options + provide additions of other fun, simple shapes! These are a cross between building blocks and Legos.. unlike blocks they hold together.. and unlike legos, they easily separate!  Simple to connect.. if you have a negative end the piece will practically flip itself to a positive connection- It's like magic..!!! Perfect for littles who are learning as they grow. A great way to enhance imagination and dexterity. **Lastly, set is an awesome tool for learning math. From simple basics of counting to grouping.. adding/subtraction even fractions!! Who knew!!? A great gift idea or even a fun addition to classroom or dr. office- easy to wipe down and clean.. a win/win for many phases, stages and ages! Hoping this info can help make your decision.. stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "It's true, adults get excited about summer too… we even love to relax on a pool float! But the struggle is real- most adult options are standard boring “mats!” These can be cumbersome taking up much water surface from others.. Or, you find the float to be sized far too small OR, worst of all- gimmicky!! I don't care what you say.. straddling a dinosaur and holding on for dear life getting chaffed by plastic arms is not relaxing comfort!!! FindUWill has made a set that is the Cinderella trifecta of adult floats…<br /><br />1. Sized adequately for actual adults- this has a netted center so, cheeks aren't popping out the bottom nor, is the saucer taking on water readying to capsize! The interior net helps you ride nicely in  the circle while allowing water to breach which helps to keep you cool.<br /><br />2. Working handles help and hold.. hallelujah!! 1/2 the battle can be “mounting” your float! These provide 2 built-in sturdy plastic handles to give the user solid confidence.. they help you get in/out and situated. But they also provide ability to connect floats together. If used at a lake, this is a huge bonus and allows users to create the floating island effect!<br /><br />3. Drink holder: need I say more! This is placed on x1 side and is situated where it's easy to reach.. it's sized for a soda can width- or any water bottle of the same measurement. Fit is snug to keep it from spilling or falling out.<br /><br />A perfect adult option that kids can enjoy just the same.. It's well thought out, user friendly and for a plastic blow up toy.. quite structurally sound! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Hoping this info can help make your decision- stay safe everyone!",

    "text": "With a 2yr old wanting his turn on a PS4- only it's against “teen code” in our house- We can set this up next to it.. and watch the cousins play away!! It's  been fun seeing all nostalgic options pop up..<br />A TOTAL THROW BACK TO THE 80's… I LOVE IT!! Tbh, older kids are in awe we played with such archaic amenities- Ohh well.. their loss! Those from the “greater” generation will truly appreciate!<br /><br />Battery life was subpar for us. Stating 4hrs. when fully charged.. we only got 1x. BUT, bc this can be used while connected to an outlet or battery boost, we're still happy! *Note: blue option only offers x1 controller and I missed that! Would be nice to have for x2 player option- only I haven't found add-on for just single controller yet. *IF you NEED 2 player- Order upgrade with original purchase.. or you may not get option!! Size is smaller and easy for little hands to manage- aesthetically adorable on the shelf!<br /><br />We set up indoor tent and connected this for our little guy- he was smitten! Screen has a surprisingly nice picture and did best in darker lighting. I'm grateful if “wrong” button is pushed, it's harmless. Simpleness allows independence for child and peace of mind for you! Although we haven't connected to tv.. not sure we will!? All cords and instructions are straightforward and included. As a mom without tech skills- I'm confident I could manage connections.. **just keep instruction book- it will help walk you through steps when needed.<br /><br />Favorite features: x1 is mute and all my praises for it!! x2 is the “wake-up” achieved by hitting on the side- it brings/wakes up features! (how cute is that?! Just like knocking an old tv set for better picture- ha!!) For the price point $30+ this is a lot of fun. For those who need to trick a toddler, this does the trick! Any wanting nostalgia- you'll get it. “In car option” for road trips is also perf. with no wifi needed- *just bring the charge cord and system will keep up as long as they do.. a solid that won't break the bank and can be enjoyed by many- hoping info can help your decision- stay safe everyone.",

Everything about these are so much fun- the colors are bright and details have not been overlooked… One can easily teach little ones how to identify different foods as details are really impressive. I've included photos of the interior favorites we have!!<br /><br />But the learning doesn't stop there- as I mentioned bright primary colors.. we began pointing out to our 20mo old- “red tomato” or “yellow lemon” and so on.. although not able to repeat the words quite yet- If you ask for a green, purple, etc.. he now will hand those specific colors to you! Ha- learning without even trying.. Great for making groups of colors, patterns to follow or counting numbers by objects or pieces- I am absolutely impressed and loving this set on every level!<br /><br />These come with a play knife to pretend cut apart- an action to help practice dexterity and even a small cutting board to perform this on! Items come  contained in plastic fruit basket.. I do wish this had a lid to keep all pieces secure- but unfortunately this is an open top.. A downfall for me! Set includes a few replacement Velcro dots in a bag- Perfect for parents to hold onto in case a dot pulls away..<br /><br />Why 4 star? Only reason is bc 90% of these have all the extra detail and merit- and a few although they do not fall short but, they lack the same type of attention as others.. possibly to keep cost down? I mentioned just in case this matters. I don't hesitate to recommend, at $26 price- one will definitely get use out of these in so many ways. Would make a great gift pretty little one boy/girl! Hoping this info helps your decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "Bright and whimsical multi learning tool flower pot that's disguised as a toy! This helps develop and teach a variety of developmental and intellectual skills which progress to a degree as the child grows! Purchased for an 18mo. old.. its a solid age for him to grow use now and grow with. (best for littles at least 12mo+)<br /><br />For starters this helps with dexterity and hand/eye coordination- Toddler seems to love pulling the flowers and replacing them in his own.. loving this has a soft magnetic pull to help guide placement successfully until skill is mastered. Notice photos I included- flowers can be plucked and stored in bucket by removal of dome dirt lid.. trust me, our little does this over and over and over and…!! We begin elevating by removing flowers in certain order as he tries to mimic. *Count aloud when doing this and you're adding another skill set.. told you- the learning options are endless!<br /><br />As ones cognitive learning is developing this offers up bright primary hues that will be an added resource in teaching colors.. As I pluck flowers from basket- I'm usually stating its color out loud- or counting off #'s of flower I have picked. It's true.. we know toddlers have keen audio processing skills beginning to take place- this toy helps reinforce that.<br /><br />flower tops are printed with a # (1-5.. and x1 is a bumble bee, total x6 flowers or.. x12 pieces if you pop flower off stem!!) you can use as they grow to learn counting themselves and written recognition. Even small mathematical equations can take place.<br /><br />See.. for $14- this flower basket offers quite a bit! It's also ideal decor if left sitting out on the shelf.. it will brighten any space or place! Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "title": "You cant go wrong- easiest adulting ever..!!",
    "text": "A hybrid of sorts- as its a cross between a board game and social activity! It looks like a game, you sit to play it like a game.. yet, it's NOT a game! There's no competitive edge, rules to follow, no winners vs. losers or, right/wrong answers.. Nope! No chugging a beer at the end of your turn!<br /><br />This is a box of organized conversation!! Everyone gets a turn without one person dominating the chatter.. this will pull in the shy and quiet in the group- as it leaves no one out! Game is a bit eye opening thought provoking, self reflecting, laugh making, memory reflecting, ice breaking and scruple sharing. A creative way to spark organic conversations from a question stemming on a card. Nothing too racy, personal, awkward or vulnerable- just a fun way to get acquainted and understood by those you play with.<br /><br />Could be played with teens.. but, more inline for adults. A solid option for office activity, newlyweds, family dinners.. vacations, neighborhood game night (ha!) even dating! I sent with my daughter in college and x4 new roommates- it just provides a solid way for ALL to get to know each other and get the chatter started!<br /><br />In léui of rules this has more like “guidelines” which  adapt and fit to whatever your need. At dinnertime we'd asked x1 question each.. and everyone takes a turn answering. (Yes! We got in plenty of use prior to sending it off to the dorm!!) This is a great date night activity.. a card between couples before bed, neighborhood bbq's.. there's no way you can't make it work for you.. No wrong way to play- you can make rule to answer for another player at table- take turn to all answer same question x1 at a time.. impose x30 sec. response to shorten game.<br /><br />X400 cards in x3 categories: icebreak, deep, deeper. Category is printed in bottom card corner- but, why make all look the same? Maybe use a different color.. anything to help identify!? Also wish this had expansion packs- how great to have specific decks.. social justice, travel/vacation, holidays, childhood, families etc. An option to refresh after played x1 too many rounds- seller take note!<br /><br />At a $20 price point- this is a solid deal for the endless amount of fun to be had. Even though game board isn't needed- I appreciate the deck come in a game box.. easy to store in game cupboard with other games/entertainment. *note: this is available for friends, couples and adult version- yet, friend can't be used for ANY type relationship.. very universal. Sorry so long-winded I wanted to explain all aspects for those unfamiliar.. Hoping this info can help you all- stay safe!",

    "text": "Such a clever idea!!! The perfect gadget for a little one learning to speak.. and I'm so impressed with its ability to do so as easy as sliding in a “coded” card. Toddlers love to press buttons with electronic responses.. ours was smitten from flipping the on switch! IF, child lacks dexterity to put card into thin slot- parent can do this part and let little push buttons.. just till they master the task- so it doesn't damage cards.<br /><br />I'll admit- Reading device feels light, almost hollow… Causing initial concern to its integrity along with the fact- it's quite small in size. But, once in play, I was beyond impressed.. this surpassed all expectations! With included USB cord one plugs into power until gaining a full charge which for us outlasts a toddlers attention span.. we've used x2-3 before recharging- LED will indicate when charge is complete.<br /><br />Over 200 color coded cards gives options such as: colors, shapes, animals, people, nouns, etc.. One can select a color and run thru cards in that genré or, one can shuffle deck for sporadic mix of words. One can even make up stories by picking specific cards to go along with storyline or imagination.. The options are endless and all yours!!<br /><br />Volume is regular speaking tone- nothing too loud. The device will speak a few extras when staring or trading cards.. so, a few added perks like to discover.<br />The one place for improvement would be on any specific card- if it read the printed name and then, common versions of the card as well. ie. Card reads MOTHER… I'd like it to say- mom, mommy, mama.. just so child could hear and relate the specific word used in your household! It would help make a few of these cards more identifiable.. **I'd love to see add-on packs of cards available to purchase as well so, seller take note!<br /><br />At a $22- Price point this is universal and unisex… Something to help any little one learning to speak, spell or read. Could be an incredible asset with bilingual learning! Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "Such a great way to let little ones grow and use their imagination.. and who doesn't love a fort?! Personal space provides space for a child to do things independently, in their domain.. “their fort-their rules!” Ha!! Not to mention..  giving as a bday gift solidifies my title of “the best aunt ever!!”<br /><br />Assembly is easy and straightforward- pole comes in half length to make for a smaller footprint when stored. You will 1st attach poles to create the full size- then, slide each pole into premade gutter and tie off poles. Use ballast to secure any movement- and teepee away!! Used by indigenous who were brilliant and perfected the art of a nomadic lifestyle.. this benefits you with this design.. easy to set up, change locations or store- it's too perfect! (think umbrella closure when not in use and propped into a corner.. all so easy.)<br /><br />Material is a softer midweight fabric covered in unicorn print with a feminine color scheme. I love it still includes cut out windows along with a tie back door.. this creates good sight lines into interior space which is helpful to keep eyes on a toddler inside. *I purchased small rechargeable “night light-sound machine” to create interior lighting and ambience! With nature sounds: birds, cricket, water, wind, stream.. its just perfect! Soft light allows for reading and eliminates any fear of the dark..<br /><br />TAKE NOTE: photos on webpage show a matching floormat.. this is NOT included!! I improvised with a 4'4” 360° round shag rug in similar colors to help define space and add creature comfort- (in hind sight- it would have been better in square vs. round shape rug.. but, either can suffice and fulfill the need. Fake fur keeps with the theme!)<br /><br />ALSO NOTE: online description mentions storage bag included- ours did NOT!! Not a dealbreaker but you will want to find a storage solution so this can be kept in its entirety and used for years to come. Hoping this helps your decision- stay safe everyone.",

    "text": "Hands down the sweetest, most clever and well thought out of all pretend kitchen/house playware sets Ive seen.. EvEr!! So much packed into a smaller size footprint- this will engage your tot on so many levels..<br /><br />Bc of size, it's perfect for any with minimal space such as an apartment, playroom, placed in a childs bedroom in a corner! Not too deep to protrude into ones living space.. And the lower height is ideal for younger/shorter littles- they can easily reach almost if not every level. Note: placed on raised sturdy platform- this set can be enjoyed as a little one grows taller.. making it perfect for years to come!!<br /><br />Perks are plenty! Truly not a single ounce of space is wasted. Knobs spin 360° and click-click as they do! AAA batteries add light to specified spots (oven hood, range, microwave) simulated cooking sounds at a push of a button.. Details are to die for! Tiny doors with peep windows- all impressive. Matted colors are unisex, combo of included options keeps child rotating thru each little niché- while holding interest.<br /><br />Add-ons are welcome! Our velcro/wooden food set is ideal with this..cook, wash in the sink, nuke, oven bake! HACK: A few wash clothes makes the perfect laundry. Easy for littles to place in/out of dryer and even learn to fold. Love recycle feature- Teaching kids but, enjoy sliding items into slots.. kids just love little quirks like this!<br /><br />As for the build: tricky! LOTS of detail connections to do! READ step by step- you'll thank me later! Far easier with a buddy x1 holds in place- x1 is the tool wizard! Doing so allows a more solidified and tight connection- plus, it cuts building time in half!!<br /><br />At $99- this is worth the build for hours and years of pretend play to come. Just as precious as photos show- perfect gift idea. Hands down I recommend! Hoping info can help your decision- Bon appétit!!<br />**note battery NOT included- you'll need x6 AAA.<br /><br />Update: after playing with this for a few weeks we realize- our fan isn't working- and never has!!? TBH, I thought it was a dead switch for fun- but clearly it should make a simulated fan noise. I'm not going to return because of the tedious build being complete. Something you should check prior to building- put a battery in all accessories to make certain items function prior to the build if needing to be replaced!! PS our little one still loves this :)",

    "text": "Having a teen who likes to expel excess energy by goofing around with his standard style yo-yo.. I knew when he saw this online.. it would make a great stocking stuffer and challenge. I LOVE to promote any activity that gives one a break from screen time..!! This teaches much more then a trick using talent- it promotes focus, patience and dare I say practiced discipline!? A win/win for me..<br /><br />Ordered in the larger size I was mistaken by actual measurements given- and for any who may not know.. take note: the sizes printed are just for the cups itself.. So, this was surprisingly bigger than anything I had anticipated!! Length is 18” in the sticks alone.. along with length of the yo-yo itself. ** see photos included for actual size idea..<br /><br />Cup portion is made of a hollowed plastic and does appear durable- however, the sticks may be a different story! Thinner and in the longer length- makes these more vulnerable to breaking.. i'm certain there's a purpose for the lightweight material being used in construction- my guess it's necessary to perform the actual tricks?! One should just be careful to have plenty of clearance from hard objects when learning/practicing.. hitting into a solid item could potentially cause these to break! Definitely an item for older kids/adults.. Otherwise these may be a bit too fragile!! Priced at $35- it does seem a bit excessive for the actual materials used.. however, if enjoyed- it may end up $ well spent.<br /><br />Not an easy feat to begin learning how to use- I suggest googling a few videos.. we found this is the easiest place to start and helped far more than any written instruction!! Be prepared to use patience and practice with this skill- but, I think I mentioned that already..!! hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe.",

Nothing like resurrecting his skills during pandemic but, he found elementary yo-yos quite tangled..!!! With his forgotten enjoyment of this toy- I set out to find an option that was solid but, wouldn't break the bank.. and the MAGIC V6 did the trick.<br /><br />This is a beginner level and for one who plays for fun.. there's an appreciation for the responsive return! I recommend this for any who aren't patient or skilled enough quite yet, get a responsive yo-yo first… At least util you mastered your skills!! Mine likes the weight bc of the counter pressure it creates.. it makes for a longer hang time.. which is a plus when you're not super skilled in the art! For something that will be visited short term- $14 is a respectable price point for a “professional yo-yo!” Trust me these things can get pretty pricey..?!!<br /><br />Overall this is a great place to start for anyone wanting to take their skills past a fun toy level. Hoping this info can help your decision.. stay safe!",

However, I do wish there was a more substantial casing.. to feel a bit more “official” and to protect pad better. Ha.. I'm telling you if they did try to emulate the feel of an iPad a bit more- kids would be fooled a lot longer!!<br /><br />A tad confusing and we're still unsure when the pad is turned on/off..??!! There is NO light to show otherwise- this wouldn't bother so much if it didn't suck the life out of and waste batteries. As for now, before putting away the only way to ensure shut down: we must scribble on pad and see if it will “erase” and if so, IT IS ON..!! If not, it's off and good to put it away.<br /><br />This is perfect for car rides, traveling, office waiting rooms, rainy days, Saturdays, etc.. I love it focuses on creativity and helps a child utilize their own imagination. This can be A fun way to practice spelling words.. there truly is no limit! At a price point under $15- this makes for a clever gift and one that would be greatly received. Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe.",

    "text": "Perfect item for toddlers who are stuck in that quirky place.. between infant toys not peaking or holding their interest yet, toddler toys are a bit cognitively too hard!! At 18mo. This is the perfect size being its lower profile.. for a little to play without your help! They can climb on/off and scoot a few feet.. if they tumble or bump off, no worry of injury with adult supervision and used on carpet.<br /><br />Ours is entertained by anything he can load and unload on his own.. Ohh, and pushable buttons seem just too much for him!! This space blaster delivers in spades.. he'll mount up scoot a few ft. all just to get up and meticulously load in items around the house into the seat! Then, repeat the process stop- and time to unload his haul! Before each scoot.. he moves through a button sequence with the gadgets provided on the dash… he even removes spaceman and puts into the seat- filling up the “under the hood” as well.. This $38 item has provided us our longest entertainment yet at this awkward stage.<br /><br />Downside components noticed: this does not have a mute button!!! If turned on you get both lights ans sounds- Would love ability without sound when using dash controls- as the sounds get daunting!! I recommend indoor use only and although this can in theory function outdoors.. I find it's not made for outside elements! Concrete rips up plastic tires fast and any water sprinkler, rain, etc will bring it to an early demise..!! (If used outdoors place on grass + bring inside after use!)<br /><br />A quirky toy for that awkward phase and one I'd recommend.. it's not the element of riding that entertains- but, rather what can be done while maneuvering!!

Ha! it's the name of the game!!<br /><br />I appreciate the challenges are quirky and a bit childish but nothing wildly offensive or out of line.. this could be appropriate if played by a family with teenagers and up- (I say teen for comprehension!) This is great for college kiddo's who may even put their own spin on the game to make it a bit racier or intertwine a drinking element- that's the fun of this (and college!!) it's meant to adapt easily for all players.<br /><br />One downside to the extended play version (ie. the weekend long Challenge..) is keeping track of all the games moving parts. Each player holds their wallet dossier of challenges in a credit card size fliptop envelope- I won't lie, this can be a bit tricky to collect when game is completed. HACK: If you go for the long game- snap photo of your challenges in your secret wallet with individual cell phones and that way, you leave actual game pieces in the box! You'll have to cross off with a symbol etc.. but, it helps keep game in tact for future play.<br /><br />A great game to play at a family reunion weekend or holiday, road trip, a day at an amusement park.. perfect for dorm challenges or getting to know you events- I could see this incorporated in a work setting as well.. A lot of options and a lot of fun!! Nothing like you've ever played before… Definitely worth adding to any game covered! Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe.",

Having a little one who just entered the incredible phase where they begin to mimic your every move- this set is all too perfect! The fact we have a play kitchen with a few pots and pans.. KaeKids cutting food set is the perfect addition to completing our kitchen. I'm just not sure who's more entertained.. the adult or child?!<br /><br />Fun colors grab a little ones attention and the easy to attach Velcro pieces.. make it possible for even tiny hands to be successful with both, cutting apart and connecting the pieces. Not only does this encourage pretend play.. we love the matching game as well! Separating pieces and let them find the other half that looks the same… Or, imagine play by creating new fruits/veggies by mix and matching! Lots of fun to be had..<br /><br />As for product/pieces: the various foods feel sturdy and solid. Made of thicker materials so, nothing feels weak or able to crush in on itself. No issue with Velcro lifting or peeling.. so far, all is right and secure.. and set up is great. Including a nice variation different food groups. Basket is nice to help store and included cutting utensils is a bonus! HACK: if wanting more/varied cutlery- add a safe plastic set.. perfect for when more then one little wants to play!<br /><br />For $25 you get a 70 piece set.. and truly some of the more unique food items I've ever seen in this style! This makes a great option for pretend play.. something a little one will continue to use as they grow. Hoping this info can help your decision.. Bon appétit!",

    "text": "For a price point of $30 I was expecting a strong durable toddler toy.. and with movable pieces for a child to interact with I was hopeful that it would keep a little one engaged and happily entertained- for as long as one toy can do with little people! The longer list of musical options also gave me promise this wouldnt recycle the same song/sound to drive parents crazy.. (we already have to endure baby shark on the endless loop!!) Well, let's just say this fell short of expectations.<br /><br />Overall product has much less substance to it structure- I imagine fisher price as the standard in solid/quality.. this is thin, wobbley and due to its height- it does not provide a weighted base to help keep it sturdy and upright when a child is playing with it. Yes! A 1yr. old is a bit more clumsy but then again… It's sold for this age bracket!<br /><br />As for the concept- it's great in theory. Surprisingly, little ones tire from it quite easily.. after putting ball down the shoot- they have mastered the task- it doesn't provide much variation to hold interest.. I know, it sounds harsh but kids are a tough critic! But also- totally honest!!<br /><br />Songs and sounds?? If this has the ability to play 30 variations.. Im not hearing it?! Don't expect 30 sing along songs- if a fish has “a recorded one line” it counts as x1 of the 30 variations- I wasn't expecting this. I imagined 30 kid songs to play and sing along too.. not small snippets of chatter or tune lasting 3-10 seconds. Just know- this is what you get! I do appreciate 2 volume settings- speaker is adequate.. its mostly clear so it's not just chaotic noise.  But, overall theme for price just feels far cheaper than it should be.<br /><br />This does what it shows online.. it sends balls thru a sensor to trip a recorded “blurb” as the ball rolls to the bottom- child picks up and repeats action again.. over/over. If this is something you're after, this may be for you. Easy assembly- it does have a strong presentable box thats nice if gifting!? Just doesn't work for us and expectations.. I wanted solid quality, engaging and cognitively stimulating with sing along ability. What arrives is a lesser and different version of this. Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe!",

    "text": "Far smaller than I was expecting- it still holds merit and cuts out a lot of frustration for a little one.. while creating plenty of fun to entertain. (see photos comparing size above!) The smaller size box does have its perks.. ie. it fits on child's lap easy enough- and smaller size allows for easy travel or take along toy when needed.<br /><br />I actually went looking for a “shape box” that used only one simple shape bc, mine would become so flustered with the more difficult pieces on a different sorting box we had..!! Instead I found this- and it works! This is made for any age to enjoy with success with the much easier concept. So, I appreciate the versatility- something I didn't realize I would need with 17mo. old at the time.<br /><br />Box is designed with “double bands” on 2 sides, and “single bands” on the other 2. So, it can provide a difficulty level if wanting to challenge a childs cognitive thinking to sliding the shapes through. This box being simpler still provides options.<br /><br />Not sure why? About 50% of these shapes are a strong plastic and the other 50% are very thin and flimsy. So, it does give concern how long those cheaper objects will last before crushed or obsolete!? The one upside with this- you could replace objects to use within this sorting box to practically anything if desired. In fact, our box has extra pieces in it already! I find a lot of “kitchen food” from a different set end up inside this box!!?*But, I mention just so you are aware- For price of toy at $20- it would be nice if 100% of object were at top caliber.<br /><br />Overall.. a great concept. It has more versatility and because of the stretchable/universal design it is a toy that can be utilized a lot longer. This can definitely start younger and grow with a child while using it for different learning skills! Hoping this info can help your decision.. stay safe.",

It's not that anything is wrong with what's included.. it just lacks so much possible activity which could've made this so right.. It lacks what is needed to hold a little ones attention and keep them engaged!!<br /><br />This is 3 larger double sided page/boards that barely have x1 minuscule activity per side which doesnt add up- bc, Fisher Price is usually spot on with their target audience! Ex. if you see my photos above: x1 entire board (16x20) is designated to a sliding car that moves 1” side to side.. another has a small vent that slides up/down 1”…?? I included photo with cute animal shape in cut out window.. but, it does nothing!!? You see- many opportunities missed!<br /><br />Plus side, bright colors attract attention, whimsical sounds can be started by a button- (it just has to be pushed repeatedly to continue) Our 16mo. old quickly bounces around each board looking for any fun to grab his attention.. besides the 3 block fit in shapes.. he's done within minutes. At a $40 price point, I am afraid this misses the mark.<br /><br />Where I see this best suited is for the infant trying to go mobile.. crawling or standing- this can help support or draw them in! Otherwise, i'm not sure it will live up to expectations. Note: This can fold and store within itself to a smaller footprint- that's always a plus!

I wasn't wrong!!<br /><br />Placed on the back of his freshman dormitory door- I am told during study breaks it is flipped around.. and from the hallway dorm mates and passer by's can try their hand at a jump-shot.. *disclaimer: I'm told this is a great way to meet girls- it's an excuse to strike up a conversation and challenge them to a shot… WOW!! Is it worth it or what..  Need I say more!!?<br /><br />The backboard itself feels quite sturdy for a replica toy and the finished metal framed edge gives it a more official look. I appreciate the breakaway rim.. however, this won't last a lifetime (I'm hoping a solid year of dorm life!) The trick is with the breakaway basket- knock it down but, do not hang, grab onto or pull with any force.. (remember it's pretend!) as for the score board.. ehh! It should record shots but not accurate- I don't think it's a dealbreaker since it doesn't take away from the fundamentals. I love this includes 2 miniature balls and a pump.. taking only minutes to fill.<br /><br />Easy assembly- connect the netting with basket on front.. and if using over the door hook- then Boom! You're ready to go.. **HACK: using a zip tie or paper clip- one can easily close bottom of net and shoot for accuracy.. keeps ball from bouncing off everywhere! Also a great way to store ball so out of way and easy to find.<br />Great gift idea- better put together then other versions both physically and aesthetically.. it will probably be longer too!

    "text": "Made with intentions to fill a ball pit.. these will do just that! I added this group to our set and from photos above, you can see the actual balls come in 2 sizes- note: these are the smaller of the two in size (fill up less space but, easy for small hands to grab and hold onto.) Some balls are a bit plumper then others- (again, see photo's) Made of thinner outside plastic shell- none of the balls arrived crushed or damaged. I assume variations in fill are to be expected with compressed/captured air.. not all amounts will be 100% exact. Also with ball having the slight bit of compression it helps create a softer landing for little ones.. this fill ratio is what allows them to jump, fall and play in the ball pit without meeting a firm, hard plastic landing.. like tiny “air pillows!”<br /><br />Using daily for almost x1 month we haven't had a single ball crushed beneath the weight of kids.. I think with # of balls in play it helps disperse the direct pressure that would cause a collapse.<br /><br />Ball pit we use is 360° X 36” X 11” height. *Take note: #100 balls won't even begin to fill the pit in any real capacity- and we actually have a smaller ball pit! Emptied into container above- these #100 cover approx. 85% of bottom/single layer. If you're truly wanting to create the ball pit affect.. I suggest investing in a set of #300. (Good rule of thumb is #100 balls = 1sq. ft. of ball pit space. So, for our 36”/3' pit.. we need #300+ balls. Doing this fills our container 50% and its perfect. It gives kiddos room to bury, play and still keep balls contained.)<br /><br />Easy to clean- these can be emptied into bathtub, rinsed and left to drip dry… These also stand up to a good Lysol spritz- to give parents peace of mind.<br /><br />If you're looking for quantity of balls to fill a ball pit- these are a solid option. $20 balls for #100.. these come in a zipper carry bag for easy storage.

    "text": "Perfect for imaginative play… I love the idea of the intricate practiced skill in cut/slicing these in half or even pull and peeling!!<br /><br />Having a smaller set similar a few decades ago (velcro slicing fruits) these seem to lack the heftier substance in the plastic body compared to the older version… these almost feel a bit hollow? But, still being a hard plastic exterior they'll maintain shape 100%. TBH, this is something I'm writing off to the world being more plastic conscious- if shape is maintained using less plastic.. then why not?!!<br /><br />These have been met with mixed reviews and I find it unfortunate. Personally, our set was totally on point!! No loose velcro tabs- It is odd you apply all velcro tabs yourself to vinyl activity chart- (i'm guessing to keep costs down in production down?) **NOTE: If any velcro feels loose- one can place a dot of permanent glue to assure adhesion..<br /><br />Colors vivid and bright, eye catching.. and there are lots of them! It's a great mix for our 18mo. old who loves fill a pot + stir the pieces! He loves the ability to pull pieces apart with his hands.. it must feel victorious (too young for activity chart as of yet- we set it aside..) I'm working now as we just clump together colors on her own- Counting as we go.. their brains absorb so much, this is a great way to learn colors, #'s, shapes, names of items etc..<br /><br />Bottom line this has exceeded my expectations- I'd recommend for your own child or as a gift.. I find it would be well received and get plenty of mileage. Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe!",

    "text": "After assembling and being very excited.. I was hoping for creative entertainment- what I ended up with was a bit of a let down…<br /><br />First, you will need to forgive the noisy motor that is masked with subpar song! From there you're left with 3 dolphins that round a track and albeit entertaining for 1-2 min.. you're quickly brought to that “so what's next” step? While the fish circulate for a moment… One gets out of sorts and they compile into a mess!! In theory, these are to be fished with the hooks- but, it takes a precise hand as there is no “magnetic” connection from hook to fish..!! After a few failed tries… Our little one walked away! Now, anytime turned on- he walks over and just puts all fish in a pile and that's about it.. definitely not the reaction I was hoping for!!<br /><br />**FYI- small fish (size of a jack) end up in toddlers mouth just like things do- and this is concerning.. so, i do recommend constant supervision.<br /><br />I have included photos to show hook and mouth and how precise connection it must be- more skill then toddler has is needed.. other photos show track and overall size..<br /><br />Set up was relatively easy with a few minor connections and an included page of instruction illustrations. This has a USB cord but, it is short!! Definitely will need longer cord or an extension.<br /><br />Table is very short legged.. if placed over the lap of a child- they bump it with their legs.. knocking it all off track to start over!! *I suggest placing at coffee table height and letting child stand to have free movement.. It's the best success we had.<br /><br />For $35- this is not what I had hoped for.. it isn't a toy that can engage a 2yr old who's interested in everything!!? A better design and overall idea would be needed to make this child engaging. Of course, varied ages will respond differently- hoping this info can help your decision.. stay safe.",

    "title": "Best set ever!! combo'd with “extras” let me explain!!",
    "text": "Ok, this is a 2 in 1 set of sorts and stay with me.. I can clarify! Absolutely a 5 star set and awesome little kitchen simulator! The minimal stove top with its 2 smaller size cooktop options make it easy for littles to move or carry. Ohh, and the battery operated noises are so easy to manipulate- there is no wrong way to use them.. kids will get a sound response every time!<br /><br />In photos I included- you'll see 5 velcro food items- these are best I've EVER seen in their uniqueness, bright colors and fun details!! These along with the stove top, pots and cooking utensils are the complete set and 100% where ALL the quality is. Worth the $20 price point for sure.. this is all the set really needs..!!<br /><br />Now, for the remainder of items: food, flatware, plates.. these don't match the other pieces as they're not the same quality. These are a “dollar store, hollow, bendable plastic” that will meet their demise rather quickly! Saying this isn't necessarily a bad thing.. it's as if these are quantity filler pieces that act like an “add-on bonus.” These may extend the playtime or imagination options.. TBH, they are fun extras to have.. just wish they were more substantial to match the rest.<br /><br />Having said all this.. I'd recommend as this set is one of the better ive seen. This allows your little one to learn color match, size + shape differences and it does wonders for the fine motor skills! Our 13mo. Meticulously puts each item in a pot with a lid on top and carefully separates Velcro, and then matches correctly back together.. you'll be surprised how much they can absorb given the opportunity.. Photo above shows pot handle.. it is The only item one must assemble- otherwise, this is ready to go out of the box right out of the box- just add x3 AA batteries! Sorry so long winded… Hoping this helps in your decision- stay safe!",

    "title": "Bigger in size- #50 isn't a lot in theory for ball pit!!",
    "text": "Ordered for 1yr. old in hopes to create a “ball pit” inside a movable in/outdoor vinyl hexagon- The idea is to make a personal ballpot.. Expect #50 balls barely covers if, 1/2 the surface of the bottom of a 36”x11” round collapsible pool! I realize it may sound like a lot but, when you see bag of 50 in play- you'll understand volume issue.<br /><br />So, before choosing quantity.. know the effect your hoping to get- along with the size of space you're wanting to fill! To make an adequate “ball pit” one needs at least #250-350 balls to fill the space. Using our larger amount still only filled the depth below 1/2 way.. yet, it feels a safe amount with age of our infant.<br /><br />Surprisingly, these were larger than the original set I had ordered. Mixed sizes actually make a fun variation.. these can still be palmed by the 1yr. old we're trying to entertain- solid enough but, some are translucent held to the light yet, having said that- we've had no issue with balls collapsing in or, puncturing it all!!?<br /><br />Colors are great mix and bright enough to get and hold babies attention.. they are firm yet, still soft so if tossing around little ones- they won't hurt anybody… and that's always a good thing!<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun starter set to be used for any need… not Just ball pits! We dumped them into tub with the little guy- and he LOVED it! Plus, it's a great way to wash balls too.. A great gift idea for a birthday for sure. Hoping this info can help your decision.. stay safe!<br />**photos included show #50 inside pool, bright colors, comparison of #150 balls used, comparable to both size options..",

    "text": "Don't be fooled… The states it's playable for ages 12 and up- that proved a little bit difficult. I'd suggest at least 18yr of age- not for content but, for concept!! (especially in ongoing play mode!)<br /><br />This is a game that can continue playing over a wknd etc and that proves difficult for younger age also, it's very frustrating when we played with a large age gap- we found college-age could run circles around our younger kids.. to the point of frustration- the worst kind of results in a game setting! However, when younger age played with their peers they seem to enjoy it a lot more… Probably true of any game?! It seemed the younger brains were “out of sight out of mind” when In the continued play mode.. so, they'd hated when they got “assassinated” when not thinking game!!!<br /><br />Great idea for a weekend getaway or, vacation with a group of friends or couples. We went so far as to have our waiter in on helping an opponent say one of our kill words!! It has potential but, it does need players to focus and pay attention when discussing and going over the rules and how too's of the game.. (trust me, you'll find yourself circling back a few times- seems there's always those few in the crowd!!)<br /><br />When played with set parameters we did have a lot of fun and found after everyone has been burned a time or two- it brought out the competitive streak in those so, we had to play again.. and again!! Our longest round lasted 71hrs. And it was by far the most wildest of rounds!!! Of course, we were on vacation with the thing group to make that possible.<br />Overall there is a basic concept and two routes to play… I appreciate the fact that you can easily tweak game rules to your group and do so with success. This would be appreciated for any game enthusiast… A great item for college dorm kids- it's got plenty of merit. Hope this info can help your decision- best of luck as an assassin Ha!!",

However, I bought for a little one (1.6yr old) who wasn't quite old enough to grasp imaginative or mimicking concept yet.. So, water feature ended up a good thing!! Ours likes putting things in it/out of h2o and splashing his hands etc. the water offers enough play till he can grow into the toy. *this is probably best suited for littles with imagination or the make believe concept.<br /><br />As for durability and longevity… This isn't going to last for years to come! It's a nice “busy toy!” A perfect solution any place you need a solid entertainment activity that may not have it available.. So many little fun pieces to hold ones attention- note: this isn't a hefty durable last forever type toy.. priced @ $25 one will get $ worth in the form of, it's all inclusive and can do its job. It entertains for the week of vacation in hotel room- trip to grandmas house.. and best of all, little ones can carry the backpack themselves-‘ it's very light weight.. ours loves to put on and walk around..??!! Note: this is sturdiest when placed flush against a wall- but, you can also set atop a table and just use without the legs. We do this on the coffee table.. it's the perfect height!<br /><br />A great, all inclusive pack- extra perfect for that trip or event where you need a entertaining option that is fun and exciting for a little one.. This can offer one endless hrs. of playtime. Hoping this info  can help your decision- stay safe!",

    "text": "Best float around to take down the river.. EVER!!!  Very durable and made for natural waters- lakes, rivers, camping… . Sure! *This isn't rapid worthy but, we all should know that!? IF, well kept.. this should keep on giving for a few seasons worth of use!! Store deflated in off season- it can be water ready whenever the summer rafting trip is planned. (We use 2 from last year and got more to  this year!!)<br /><br />What's not to love, this is large enough to fit most adult men.. possibly 2 small kiddos.. After a day floating the river- we avoided irritations from any chafing or rubbing from the tube itself.. and lets face it, floating the river does come with painful aftermath- it's almost expected. Tube kept things to a minimum in bumps and bruises- that's a huge perk!<br /><br />Drink holder is such a plus.. **BUT, be certain drink.. has a twist top lid!! Trust me on this one- you will thank me later! This is even a great space to hold sunscreen as you burn your way along.. love this feature!!<br /><br />I recommend using an electric or foot pump when inflating and although it may look doable in size… It needs A LOT of air to fill. You want this plumped up taut- more then you know!! **A little secret: when filled completely.. this tube rides higher in water which is nice when river water is mtn. runoff freezing cold!!! Keeps you from being in ice cold water the entire time!<br /><br />Climb rope is a lifesaver for getting back on if, you happened to fall off. It's also great for connecting tubes together and creating a floating island.. LOVE THIS MOST OF ALL!!!<br /><br />Without hesitation I recommend to anyone who river rafts.. hands-down it's one of the best I've seen. I hope this info can help your decision… Be safe and have fun!",

    "title": "Absolutely Beautiful educational toys- with a whimsical vibe!",
    "text": "Absolutely adorable!! 100% happy to have found this set of educational toys! Let me start by saying- how beautiful these look all on their own.. truly, these could be placed on a shelf in the bedroom and used as part of the decor! The wooden shapes and button/tasks are far more then I even anticipated.. and the matted use of colors and whimsical prints are perfect for boy/girl.. These are so well made and designed, they'd be a perfect baby gift for a little one to grow into- ha! See, nursery decor till they're old enough to play.. notice how my idea keeps coming back around?!!<br /><br />I love the fact to a little one these are merely just play toys.. what they don't realize is at the same time.. they are actually stimulating the brain and learning a multitude of things! This teaches size differential- large to small, matching pairs, shapes, similar/different colors, light vs. dark and so on.. Plus, a number of physical capabilities like solid hand/eye coordination, finger dexterity... The cognitive abilities in infants are more than capable of being stimulated.. it's just giving them engaging ways to tap in and try! No need to be discouraged if your infant starts by eating the pieces or, even banging them together.. Trust me, over time after watching you they make a connection on their own time- its pretty amazing when they do!<br /><br />The five tiered stacking rings are a lot of fun and each layer is made of varied materials that are durable. These will stack up even out of order.. they can slide on/off the post however they are put on. Everything is smooth and nothing too small and concerning for baby to play with. We chose this set for an 11 month old.. and no! He hasn't mastered any of the tasks at hand but, he does try to fit shapes into holes after watching us.. and when we take lid completely off- he loads all shapes back into the box- he's figured out that's where they go! He loves to dismantle rings one at a time after I stack them.. All showing me that he's paying attention and trying to mimic! He can slide the zig-zag button back/forth but, only after he tries to bite it off the box!!?<br /><br />These are a fresh take on an old trusted developmental learning toy that have been favorites for families for decades. I love this is tried, tested and proven effective- nothings changed but the whimsical fresh 2021 look!! I'd recommend without hesitation.. hoping this info. can help your decision- feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "Great pool float that is larger in size and can be enjoyed by even smaller sized adults! I recommend for any tween/teen or adult women. Its much larger than a child size life ring but, not overly sized- and so most adult men would be able to sit on it but, not in it..!!!<br /><br />I also find this is a really good size item for the smaller pools.. this will keep the float from being too overpowering and taking up too much of the water space..  it's a very happy medium!<br /><br />inflating: This does have a built-in safety at the air valve when filling.. using an electric pump to fill, this took just a minute to complete- but, A hand pump would suffice just fine as well.<br />Love the Hawaiian print- and especially love the fact it's not dark in colors- This way it won't become too hot in the sun.. The pastels are perfect!<br /><br />As for durability… mine are not easy on pool toys to say the least! They've used this the past 3 weeks in every capacity- from a basketball hoop dunk, a bulls-eye to jump into from the side.. and a float to layout upon! Other than normal air loss in the sun and plastic expands.. this has held perfectly!!<br /><br />At a price point for $12 this should carry you thru the swimming summer season and possibly longer!

    "text": "Ordered this for nephew who graduated high school in 2021… Although, it is a great way to commemorate the craziest year in history, there were some struggles in putting this puzzle together!!<br /><br />Issue we found: Some pieces were not completely cut apart/all the way through. Therefore, when trying to simply separate stuck pieces- it was ripping the front printed photo off of the puzzle piece itself!! Once realizing this issue- we found it best to leave those pieces attached and not try to pull apart (about dzn. small groups were like this!!) For any who love a jigsaw puzzle… They also love the challenge and at the very least, they want all pieces separated and !!<br /><br />The 2nd issue was found in the puzzle pieces and the cardboard foundation- as the pieces are thin! This was frustrating when a piece would bend at the loop when trying to securely fit into place inside the cul-de-sac.. and a few pieces that had extra “debris/paper-tag” stuck to the edges (Im guessing it was caused by the poor cut?) these would split apart in what appeared to be layers of cardboard..<br /><br />For a price point of $10 and the fun theme- my nephew chose to put together and preserve it by making it into wall art using a puzzle glue! This did help stick down any of the lifted or torn pieces..<br /><br />Just keep in mind, thinner puzzle pieces and some pieces not thoroughly cut/separated and may cause this to have issues. I suggest if ordering… Turning it into wall art or, keeping for prosperity in the box! Loved the idea just lacked overall quality. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "Ordered for 10 month old in hopes to create a “ball pit” inside a movable outdoor pool- this idea works in theory.. only #50 balls barely covers if, 1/2 the surface of the bottom of a 36”x11” round collapsible pool! (I realize it may sound like a lot but, when you see bag of 50 to scale in photo included- you'll understand volume issue.)<br /><br />So, before choosing quantity.. know the effect your hoping to get- along with the size of space you're wanting to fill! To make this be adequate “ball pit” style- I'll need at least #250-350 balls to fill the space. Using the larger amount still would only fill the depth approx. 1/2 way.. but, it feels a safe amount with age of infant.<br /><br />Balls themselves are thinner and lighter then expected from previous experience.. held to light they were a bit translucent (see photo.) Having said that- we've had no issue with balls collapsing in or puncturing it all!!? Probably better sooted for younger vs. older kiddos due to thinner material ans weight may crush.. Our 19lb.  little one did fine!<br />Colors are great mix and bright enough to get babies attention.. they are firm yet, still soft so if tossing around little ones- they won't hurt anybody… and that's always a good thing!<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun starter set to be used for any need… not Just ball pits! We dumped them into tub with the little guy- and he LOVED it! Plus, it's a great way to wash balls too.. A great gift idea for a birthday for sure.",

    "title": "Here are the details for this flotation device…!!!",
    "text": "A really fun water float for infants/toddler‘s.. After using with a 19lb.10 mo. old my suggestion would be: do NOT assume the “age range” posted equates to a sure thing!! ONLY USE with infant who has solid neck control and the ability to support the weight of their own head!! w/out this babies tend to slip, slouch, slump- creating the potential to get their face too close to the water or possibly against the plastic of the actual float itself!! I don't need to state the obvious but, ADULT/PARENT supervision is a must when using- whew! I said it.. just in case!!<br /><br />Deciding between float options for infants we chose Swimschool Narwal simply bc, the baby is NOT harnessed into the float itself. IMHO- it is safest to have the ability to snatch an infant instantly out of float in case of emergency- ie. If float popped or sinks, chocking on h2o, float is getting away from you, capsize.. So, I appreciate there is no no harness to unbuckle on this float!<br /><br />Functionality: this doesn't provide adequate photos letting you know what to expect and/or how it works exactly- so, I included photos to help decipher. This is a floating triangular saucer and built into the center is a seat with an inflatable air ring fit directly around the opening. A flotation netting then connects a second/outer air ring providing the floatation device all its excess stability and buoyancy. Dead in the center is a built in crotch sling seat so, baby cannot slip straight thru ring and out the bottom! Underneath the seat (between the legs) is an adjustable nylon strap connected directly into the float itself- THIS is how one will adjust the height level an infant sits inside the device at when on the water. All the closed seams and connections seem durably reinforced and strong and this feels very structurally sound. **Note: smaller/younger infants will tighten the strap to sit higher up when in the water.. for larger child, this is loosened for seat to ride lower.<br /><br />Details: this has 2 separate air chambers.. it inflates easily and is completed within minutes (we used hand pump with zero issues..) *Air chambers are completely separate for safety purposes: in case of any air leakage or puncture, one would still be intact.. I love this forethought! But, my favorite feature is the approx. 5” netted ledge that connects the 2 air chambers.. it makes a 360° Platform that is perfect to place pool toys etc. for baby to play with and be entertained..<br /><br />The one feature this is missing- is shade!!! There is no awning attached or otherwise. Its not a dealbreaker but, I mention it bc without one, I highly recommend using a bucket hat ample sunscreen for an infants delicate skin!<br /><br />For a price point of $20- this is a solid find to help your little one enjoy time in the pool. It provides the confidence and if used appropriately-  it will be a welcomed addition to anybody's outdoor fun!  Apologies for being long-winded.. but, with so few details I hope this can help others make their decision.. feel free to let me know!",

    "title": "Great concept- but, must think thru before using!!!",
    "text": "A quirky review as, I'm unable to float inside the pool just yet (I'm counting down till memorial day weekend!!) I studied the instructions and filled this with air -which was not the easiest task, for me and I had an air pump! This has sectioned chambers needing air yet, I cannot get the last chamber to fill completely. It isn't sealed off bc, air does get in.. and it doesn't have a leak bc, air isn't escaping..?? So, I am hoping with the last chamber approx. 75% filled at best- this can hold an adults body weight?! After all, this IS listed for adult use.. Hoping after some use and stretch/pull on plastic itself will help open up the air jam to complete filling to capacity.<br /><br />The concept of an “all inclusive bag-n-pool float” is great for any who must travel to a pool.. I've tested and was surprised at the amount of space/capacity this has to hold things- No! It's not a suitcase.. but, this can easily fit ones goggles, sun screen, pool socks and even a reasonable sized pool towel. I loved these items can be tucked in and sit safely away till they reach their destination. This has a nice adjustable carry strap that allows for different lengths depending on height of person carrying.. plus, The outer mesh/elastic pocket is great for any last minute stow and go needs!!<br /><br />The one issue I foresee with this all-inclusive “bag/float” theory- is what to do IF.. you bring things such as a wallet, cell phone, electronics, keys, headphones, etc to the pool inside the float but, then want to use float in water..?? This most likely would present as an adult issue. But, If using float as a bag, you'll need some sort of smaller pack to leave items in while using in water.. otherwise, items would be left in the open? Hmm?!!<br /><br />Overall, I love the idea but, the fact this is made for adults (by sizing!) does present some trouble spots that need to be thought thru!! I hope this info can help make your decision.. good luck!",

    "title": "Great item… A gift that grows with your little one!!",
    "text": "Such a great item for anyone with an infant- and useable as baby grows! A jack of all trades floor mat.. These make great drop mats under high chairs and are so easy to clean.. A wet cloth or disinfectant wipe does the trick! The bright fun colors add an element of fun for little peeps- and are great for getting babies attention.<br /><br />Assembly is simple!! Just put into place like a puzzle- I love you can make any  configuration.. all pieces are universal! I make “runways” around furniture giving baby a safe place to crawl and play. (see photos included!) **Hack: save your box for storage.. these will fold up accordion style x4 sq. at a time- and slide back in- and this will keep mats tightly together and take minimal space storing!! *this fits nicely under a standard height bed- out of sight out of mind.. love that!!<br /><br />I recommend for any with an infant going mobile! These have a solidly firm foundation yet, a soft absorption and impact ability.. Mats eliminate issue of carpet grabbing at little feet, it provides better comfort for the tumbles and bumps as they master their skills!! Ha! Keeps tiniest of objects finding a way into babies mouth, and mats create a safe and clean place to play- I cant forget to mention.. mats stop carpet burns from crawling. A total lifesaver on tile or hardwood floors!<br /><br />Note: set has 36 large solid squares.. the 20+ remaining items in the count are just the edges (These turn notched edges into straight edge- see photo.) personally, I don't use them as they're just  aesthetics and I don't see any point (I bagged mine away!) Possibly useful if planning to leave mat out fulltime?<br /><br />Floor mats come in handy soon after baby arrives and stay in play the over the course of their 1st yr.- these would be an excellent baby shower gift. With many styles, colors, set sizes etc. to choose from- KC Cubs brand is as solid as one would want. *Extra bonus, these can incorporate add-on sets into the future.. and as kiddos grow, these make great tumbling mats and fort walls! If cared for these can last thru more then x1 child cycle as well- I always like to point that out! These mats make a great hand me down item or, “save + store” till the next little one comes along..<br />I wanted to cover it all with this fun item! For so many reasons, I recommend every parent having a floor mats set, as they are worth it for certain! I hope the info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

    "title": "ALL newlywed needs.. I've included ALL details below!!",
    "text": "A total must for those wanting to invest and get more from their marriage in a healthy way..  this review will be long winded but, bear with me-i'll give you the details bc, it's worth it and I'll share all!!<br />As one who's been married 29yrs., my baby sis' is starting into her 2nd year of marriage.. Lately, she's been having a bit of a struggle and came seeking advice- Wow! humbled, honored and out of my league to guide beyond the level of my own journey.. I went seeking ideas to offer appropriate tools that could be tailored to her situation. Lets face it- no 2 marriages are created equal! It was here I found “Openity- meaningful conversations“ and was SO  impressed. I found this helpful for any couple new to the marriage game. BUT, I could clearly see this being beneficial to any wanting a reconnect, recharge or, a relationship recalibrating.. whew, that's a lot of “R” words!!<br /><br />I gave this to newlyweds who found out- that movies and fairytales are the eye candy to relationships and the actual work begins when the going gets real and real tough. That moment that  hits soon after the euphoria is tampered down and daily life starts piling up! Oh, and when together forever really sinks in, talk of mortgages, possibility of babies, employment up/downs, boundaries, in-laws, balancing budgets, religious quirks, etc. Ha! Toss in a pandemic (Kudos btw, to all newlyweds who have had to navigate quarantine- I applaud you all!!) Its true- so many couples spend more time, effort + detail planning their wedding that will last a few hours, thinking it's a passage to “Happyland!” Truth is- as those of us who treaded the waters.. there is SO much more! Worth it, yes!! But, it takes work (something “that secret society” never told you- or else, you didn't want to hear?!)<br /><br />This tool is created by all physical standards like a game but, in reality.. it can be used however one chooses: X1 hour an evening each week, a card before bedtime ritual, dinner conversation starter- coffee chatter in the morning.. options are endless! I don't recommend “playing together” with other couples although, to each his own..Since, the gist is to help couples navigate and get to a deeper level- questions are designed to create openings for couples to safely be vulnerable and breach sensitive subjects.. I feel that depth and “security” could be lost if, played with others!<br /><br />I love the goal setting aspect as these create a way to put words into action and provide a “measuring stick” to see progress made- that can be motivating in itself! I love, love, love the challenges as well.. for example, one can accept to write down a few ideas they'd like to do for their partner that week (a challenge!) These are small, simple things that feel so big when received.. ie., make dinner together, tell a partner an affirmation or, memory by a simple note or song, it can be a surprise “I love you” text for no reason, and so on.. Not only does this give to your partner a piece of you- It helps develop positive patterns when put into action and that's a win/win for all! I love the challenge isn't difficult or $ involved either, it's just being cognizant of the other persons needs. Better yet, this confirms x1 person is truly listening and the other is being heard- hallelujah..!!<br /><br />This offers a “safety” which is a must without a 3rd party to help guide.. The contemplation option lets one take a moment on a question and circle back at a later time. This has a “turn-around” option as well, letting both parties answer a same question!  I'm telling you, it's like this covers everything in a safe and positive way.<br /><br />The creator is a therapist who's spent a career in marriage counseling and its present in the respectful creation. Neither participant should be afraid to begin.. This has safeguards to keep this a positive experience. Cards are sprinkled with ample feel good questions: ie., tell me about the day we met? What you admire most about your partner? Words to describe one another- how did you know I was the one? Even some about childhood- show me on map your hometown or dream vacation spot.. favorite childhood tradition and so on.. I call these “feel goods” and the world can't have enough of them- Hands down, I recommend for any warning to enrich their relationship. This would make an incredible wedding gift- it should be given with the purchase of every engagement ring.. ha!!<br />I warned this was long winded but, I hope giving all details I could can you help in your decision.. feel free to let me know!",

    "title": "Take note: no volume or mute button at all..!!!",
    "text": "Consider yourself warned!! You must know this is a miniature yet, bulky mechanical plastic toy.. Calling it a remote control is wrong. This does not have a remote to guide it but, rather just an on/off switch. There is no volume or mute- (warning applies here by the way!!) imagine a hollow sounding speaker placed inside a rattley plastic toy- with a few quirky sounding song tidbits.. (5 total I believe!) and equally noisy is the robotic mechanic noises of movement.. totally eye-catching and entertaining when turned on, after watching the toy “crab dance” through the loop of the songs.. You realize, this repeats itself- doing the same movements: Crabwalk forward- wiggle/prance on all 8 legs.. crabwalk back- wiggle/prance on all 8 legs.. Pause! New song and repeat!!!<br /><br />Once you've seen the duration of the loop you've seen it all… Kids can probably handle x2-3 loops longer then adults- but, even a silly gimmick toy made for sheer mindless entertainment has its limitations! Arriving from the Easter bunny in a basket- not even 5min. into the looping I found myself looking for a volume/mute button… as, this would have made all the difference mind you- We even went looking for a sound wire we could clip.. bc, that was the extent of tolerating this due to the obnoxious factor.. there is not volume/mute!!<br /><br />Now, if you can believe this… I think the best way for these to be enjoyed is getting two of them!! At least they dance together and feed off one another.. i'm not certain if music overlaps one another but.. otherwise they become rather repetitive on their own rather quickly. (kids may not care!)<br /><br />For any who's seen original Toy story series- remember Syd the neighbor used a doll head on spider legs?! It was scary but, sadly quirky cute in movie?!! Well, this reminds me of that- I'll give it “uniqueness” for sure! Keep in mind.. 8mo. old recipient was terrified when turned on- So, that is something to consider. I see these being used as an office prank or entertainment, or younger ages 3+ bc, it might just be enough to hold their attention for a quick minute. The crab legs can be a little ominous but, this is balanced with a computer animated smile to look happy and less threatening!  The Wally computer headed structure on top is where the on/off is found. These take x3 AA- and you must have a TINY screwdriver to release the compartment lid!!<br /><br />This is one of those toys that I say… To each his own! It will either be fun or make you crazy and I fell in the latter category. At a price point of $10 it's not a big investment if, not used every day. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

    "title": "Be sure these can meet your babies needs..",
    "text": "A set of various infant teething and play toys- as you can see from the photos I included.. there are x4 (of 7 total) solid toys that are compatible for tiny hands to hold onto.. I included photo of this group. Some are more teething compatible then others. Each item has its own simple but, unique feature.. ie, x1 has rubber nubs and handle for babies to easily hold and get this into their mouths! One rattle has a spinning hamster wheel style ball, hammer has beads housed inside so.. as you tap- it shakes noise, ball has a squeak inside and so on. NOTE: only electronic, interactive toy (x1 with batteries!) is the makeshift cellphone/remote.. it has x4 buttons that change sounds and color. Other toys just simulate a button push, without effects. All are made in bright colors.. But, with an active 7month old- he does seem to lose interest in these rather quickly!<br /><br />As for the quiet interactive book.. this was x1 item that felt subpar to the others. From photos included you will see, every page incurred loose threads and strings.. The magnifying glass is pretend and made of a floppy felt.. I realize the concept in using this to “search” but, Poor quality structure makes using it obsolete! You can of course, still use quiet book for entertainment without the fake magnifying glass.. it has ‘crinkle' sewn in pages to make noise- and small flaps lift or, Velcro off. BUT, these are not confidently secured to the book itself-so, I recommend using with supervision!! (this might be caused by the loose thread issue?)<br />Overall, at a price point of $25 you receive a handful of toys but, with our experience.. Truly, only x1 is attention grabbing- along with the ball! Baby loves the fact, ball is soft sided so he can pinch/grasp on his own.. problem is, it's bigger in size and when dropped, it falls and rolls out of reach.. making it a chore for mom to constantly retrieve!! Personally, when looking at toys for baby, I'm wanting to find items that are unique and stimulating.. and able to keep baby busy a solid few minute without my “need” for constant interaction. I always say- the best way to rate infant toys is: how much time do these keep child engaged!!!? (sure! We all love to spend time playing with our baby..) but, we also live in reality where we do need a few minutes to multitask.. So, I want to find toys that will allow me to do both.<br /><br />At $25 price point.. this is at higher end for x1-2 items that may grab attention, x4 that smaller infants can hold onto.. and x1 for teething. Prior to ordering just be sure this will meet needs of your infant- I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

Our 6mo. old figured out within a minute- (of course, we're pretty sure he's a genius ha ha..!!)<br /><br />Love these are ready to go from the moment they arrive- they need no extra batteries or, clips as they can be put in action once opened- see photos attached.. it's one/done.. it's just that easy! Better yet, these can easily move around to the next desired location. I love the fact there is no acrobatics or, unscrewing nor, permanent fixing- making removal so doable with a slide of the clip.<br /><br />These can wipe down with a Lysol wipe or, disinfectant spray easy enough and I do- especially with COVID-19… I'm constantly wiping everything down and these hold up just fine. Hack: x1 a week I prefer placing all capable baby toys on the top shelf of dishwasher. These having the proper slat for any liquid drainage… give me peace of mind that no yuck or gunk will get stuck inside and causing mold and germs to grow!<br />These would make a great birthday or shower gift… Or, just an extra splurge to help mom keep the baby entertained.

    "text": "Perfect Covid past time… Although, a puzzle can be fun for all ages- the second portion of this puzzle can be tricky for those who may not be familiar with advertising. So, for the puzzle in it's entirety- I would say this is best for teens on up to adults.<br /><br />With the current pandemic we have been searching the web over for ways to stay entertained at home and this is definitely a good option. Who knew, there could be another twist on a standard puzzle.. and yet, here we are..!! Best part of all- for a price point of $12.. even if this becomes a one and done puzzle/game, it's worth a family night of entertainment!<br /><br />After family played over the holidays…My college-age kiddo took this back to the dorm.. where everything social/fun is on lockdown! So, this will be a welcomed puzzle in their game basket Menagerie.. In fact, being upperclassman and of age- they turned this into a drinking game with a bottle of wine !! Hmm.. but; it's college- if, it keeps them having fun at 21yr + since bars/clubs are off the table.. I'm willing to smile through it!!<br /><br />The puzzle itself is built with solid and sturdy approx. 1+” pieces and the “pop open doors” have a little wiggling to do in order to get some open.. Note: we used a small thin metal nail to help separate the last connected portion of any pop opens that hadn't been 100% “cut” loose.. once opened the first time, there seems to be no issue afterwards! Overall, a fun twist on a standard puzzle idea… allowing you make the most of stay at home fun. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "As a lover of board games… Our family members each receive a new addition to the game closet in their stocking every year… With kids off to college- I am constantly looking for new and fun options that don't take a lot explaining or, learning and can peek their interest, liking them to be a bit competitive yet, can be played with minimal effort- So, a hard combo to find! So, I'm happy to say… “How did You know That-“ falls into this category!!<br /><br />DID YOU KNOW THAT is easy enough to learn and that's a perk! Also, a big plus is the fact, it's easy to explain it to those who have a tendency to not pay attention during rule reading (we all know a few of “those type” people- ha ha..!!) BUT, with an easy concept they'll be playing like pros in no time.. LOVE the fact, this game can be tweaked and adapted if necessary.. and we always love those! (Anything that allows you to simplify or shorten a game as needed.. is like sprinkles on top!)<br /><br />Basic idea: one person reads 4 questions in a row off of x1 card. All other players write their 4 answers down… THEN, players will correct answers as revealed for all 4 questions asked. giving x1 pt. per correct answer. If only x1 person gets it right the crowd shouts “how did you know that!” and gets double points. Its that simple..<br /><br />This is full of Quirky odd questions at various levels of some useful/not trivia! Winner is whoever has most points at the end of game..<br />Best part is: YOU decide do you play to a certain point level (1st one to 10, 20 wins?) OR, do you give everyone certain amount of cards so, everyone has a turn or two to read questions.. if so then, at the end of all reveals.. they tally up those points received  to see who's the winner! That's it..!!!<br /><br />This would make a great game for the dorms- (especially during the time of the pandemic.. these kids have a lot of Shelter in place/quarantine time!) for those old enough, I could see it turning this into a drinking game of sorts (good or, bad?!) it would easily adapt.<br />Definitely, feel this is geared toward older teens or, adults.. it's too hard for younger kids. I do feel this has a niché for academics and know it alls! Any with mega time spent learning, reading, gaining random facts off the Internet- it's a great way to share that trivial academia skills.. Ha! Some things will just be fun facts you picked up thru life, in elementary school or, info. From those who've raised you.. tossed with real trivia facts. So, the smartest person doesn't always win!? Fun for a competitive group with a plethora of knowledge and facts to share!!<br />Played with our college kids over holiday and it went back to the dorm bc, of its fun factor- with x3 college kids and/or, recent graduates.. we had a ball! I hope this info can help your decision.. feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "Wow! This is one fun little number… Young or, old!! Don't let the age range posted fool you- this may be enjoyed by all! I feel it's best suited for older children and/or, those adults who are young at heart!!  To my surprise, this does not have a child like “plasticy-cheapness-cheesiness” about it, all at a price point of under $25..!! This has the ability to be appreciated by motorcycle enthusiast and those who just like to experience sheer FUN with a new gadget. Because, that is exactly what this is… FUN!!<br />This can even look “marvel avenger like” when not in use sitting on the shelf- its a cool decor feature as well!! (See photo included!)<br /><br />The challenge is lower moderate - medium. I feel younger will mostly just appreciate the ability to be the driver of a “remote control vehicle” bc, that itself can be empowering.. and the more it's played with.. their skills will be gained over time. An older/more capable recipient will have fun testing, trying and improving their talents by perfecting some of the sick trick, figure 8 moves, leans, burnouts, 360s etc. that this can do..<br /><br />I LOVE the wheels themselves actually tilt 180° to either side and simulate a lean on an actual bike so well.. I've never seen anything else like it.. super cool!! Plus, I love this has set of stabilizer wheels under the riders feet (tiny + hard to detect- see photo I included) these prove super helpful and will help keep bike from tipping over as you perform all your trick moves!<br />We got 20-25min. from fully charged battery and as expected, tricks become harder to perform as battery dies approx. 15min. in- So, I suggest charging both batteries (included) prior to running so you double the play time! Trust me- 40min. can go quick!!<br />Remote is super easy to learn- especially for gamers! Simple 2 toggle buttons and that's it.. (needs 2 AA) x1 screw locks down both battery doors - ugh.. but, set includes the screwdriver so, don't lose it! Hack: open door over WHITE surface.. screw is black and easily lost in carpet- If happens, use a magnet to locate.. yes! I'm speaking from experience!! Overall, this is definitely a win-win for sure.. For $ spent, you won't be disappointed. I hope this info can help your decision… feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "TOTAL CLASSIC...!!! No matter what type of spin you put on charades… It will always be a solid go to/staple for any group- no matter ones talents- young or, old! My group includes a player with a disability.. and I love the fact, this can be played in teams and eliminates the worry if, one must be left out if they can read or not- this game can be easily tweaked not to exclude anyone! (with teams we pair up 2-3 players per group.. sprinkling those who need extra help amongst all teams and we take turns acting. Then, when an adult adds input/guidance, it's done without ever appearing like “help” to those who can't.. instead, it appears like a natural collaborative decision!) with party charades we actually found it to be quite helpful for adults as well to play in teams!! Some of us adults were a bit clueless to the “pop culture references!“ So, it was great to have a younger kiddos be knowledgeable on the team.. The help flows both ways with this style of set up... it's perfect!!<br /><br />Note: you can tweak the rules OR.. follow included instructions.. OR, Control the time by playing “best out of five rounds” etc. charades is a must-have for any game covered.. One more perk- Party charades definitely can help keep the mid adolescent teen group entertained as well- (this is big when playing family game night- anyone with a 17yr. old boy with coolness attitude can attest! The Party charades version actually keeps the teens entertained..!!)<br /><br />One last note/hack: we do allow for a set # of “cell phone sneaks” if no one knows the person or, catchphrase reference on the card- I recommend this just to keep the game rolling.. definitely must limit the “sneak peek” to 15sec. just enough to know Who/what but, better we found it's better then skipping multiple cards.<br />Loved party charades so much- I bought 2nd copy for my daughter to take back to her dorm room… During Covid quarantine this will bring endless fun in the dorm room, I'm certain of it..!! Hands-down recommend for sure. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

(Anything that allows you to simplify or shorten a game as needed.. is like sprinkles on top!)<br /><br />TBH, I must admit - this game is best played with those who know quite a lot about their opponents.. as the gist is: to rank in a list of “priority..” how another player would answer. So, if you don't your players that well.. it still works- lets just say you will get to know each other better after a few rounds! My daughter took to college to play with her dorm mates.. They've had a blast playing this during quarantine and said it brought up conversations they may not have ever had otherwise. So, I'd call that a win/win for sure..!!<br /><br />I appreciate the fact the game is not one to last for endless rounds or, hours.. this has a nice “Quick Pro quo” and that translates to letting others jump in/out as wanted.. plus, it creates a lot more opportunities for socialization amongst the players-<br /><br />Love the game it's self has a small footprint with minimum set up needed. This is also a game I can easily see expansion packs being created for in the future… At price point of $20- it's higher end for a handful of cards with topics on them- But, when it brings entertainment like it has, I say it's worth it.

    "text": "A great game for anyone -Super great for any who has teenagers… I will admit, that was after we made a few adjustments!!<br /><br />We first played this as a family: college kiddos with our youngest being 17yr old. Since, I purchased specifically for his crowd as a quarantine option.. I am writing review in respects to the tween genre- (just in case anyone else may plan to use for the same caveat/age group..)<br /><br />Quick background… Our youngest joined our family via adoption. Born into heavy drug exposure and abuse from conception to 3yr old. to say there is a learning deficit- is an understatement! At almost an adult age- he struggles to read and comprehend basic instructions with major cognitive disabilities- and can become Intimidated  and not give things a try. Looking for something easy to understand w/out major need for game reading.. I found myself grasping for a simple, fun and age appropriate game for him to feel confident with. But, after playing this as a family, I saw with just a few tweaks- we could make this something that met our needs with him... Jackpot!!<br /><br />So, what are the tweaks?<br />First of all, the string provided is bound up tight to fit in the box BUT, the string does not like to straighten out very well… And that matters in this game! * The concept being- you are given a shape to “create” using a string verses a pen/paper. We also found, one string was limiting- 2 made it a lot more fun.. easier?? Maybe but, I would consider it still a challenge for any who play!! Trust me, it's a bit harder than you think-<br /><br />**We added our own string (aka just a standard shoe lace) and we also added x2 of them- allowing players to use 2 strings to create an image vs. just x1, was a total riot! We did add x1 white and x1 black string- and made up a point system- more points for designing with x1 string over using x2. For example we did:<br /> 10pts for creating image with x1 string-<br />  5pts for creating image with x2 strings-<br />And the first one to 50 (you can pick high/low # depending on how long you want game to last..) the 1st to reach that #- WiNs!! That's it..<br /><br />Yes! We tweaked the game to fit our needs- But know, the basic concept of this game still is quite similar if following actual rules. (Minus an extra string!) Either way you play it's a fun take on a game with a Pictionary + charades vibe. With us manipulating the game to our circumstances actually made it more enjoyable for the whole family…<br /><br />**So, take note there's A LOT of give to make this more conducive to different abilities… For that reason, I give five stars for the fun we had playing..!! For the confidence it gave my teenager, I'd give this 10stars- Hands down!!<br />I realize, this is a unique twist on a standard review but, do hope it can still help in your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "I love games!! Im a total fan of any game that creates activity and games that are the most interactive- are the best. And this doesn't let you down.. because, that is ALL this game is!!<br /><br />This is a true scavenger hunt in every sense of what you know- it has two options which is SO perfect depending on the fact, if you want to let the kiddos go play outside or, not..? How great- this is created with items to find either: indoors or, outdoors.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this doesn't have age limits- I bought this for my collage age daughter who lives out of state in the dorm during Covid pandemic.. And this gives a fun something to “do” for her and any roommates alike- its a fun variation to cure the boredom.. Ha! this offers a fun activity and clever idea for safe entertainment.. Younger players can easily be teamed up with older to include really any age-<br /><br />Which brings me to the fact.. playing teams allows for a bigger group or, teams to be formed- So, this definitely has some flexibility for sure!! And ok, game could be played with as few as 2 but, let's just face it- this may not be as entertaining or fun?!<br /><br />And.. Which brings me to the other fact- this game has such a simple design it has the ease of altering rules to be more conducive to your group and your surroundings.. If, certain items to scavenge are not possible to find safely or, not within reason- You can just tweak (or eliminate that item) bc, It's just that easy.. adjust any part or, expectations with this hunt- trust me, it will not take away from the overall game itself.  (say it with me...)<br /><br />Which brings me to even one other fact (ha-ha!)- this provides 2 sets of cards showing players the items to “scavenge!” As stated- feel free to remove any item or, put regulations so no one brings home your neighbors nativity scene or, yard decor!! (Ok- I'm kidding.. that isn't one of the items!) but, here is a HACK: I found using standard index cards one can easily create their own add-on ideas to scavenge.. and new items to find IF.. game is played often enough and in need of some variety. You can also add on an “activity cards” and by this I mean- you create an index card with a fun suggestion for each team to do/perform and as “doing or, done” these can be documented with cell phone.. (Christmas caroling on a door, or building a snowman, making a reindeer rap..) Just write idea/item on a card.. draw or, include a photo to go with it if, necessary for explanation.. and this is just a simple way to keep the game fresh and interesting.. this can be tweaked with photo scavenging +added cards.. so, remember that!!<br /><br />This is fantastic for the holidays and will definitely become a staple in our house I'm certain of it. We are always in the market for now “realistic and doable“ activities- and games are one of the favorites. This combined game and activity.. I could recommend this without any hesitation.<br /><br />Improvements: could be made producing more durable coated cards! These get tucked/stuffed in the racing of the game and can bend and fold if not being careful… A laminated set would be fantastic! Including a few extra solid bags to collect items- just to be all inclusive and have extras as needed. (*but, this is easily be rectified by using a reusable grocery bag from home as well..) Lastly, Provide blank cards that could match and be to add on items to the deck- HOWEVER, listing 3 improvements is just a way to make a really awesome game even better.. this is definitely a keeper as it is! I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "This is such a great “add-on” toy and I say that because, it truly can be twisted around whatever you want!! Being built of a spiral body.. this naturally wants to twist around ANY handle or straight line it can “vine” onto.. no buckles, suction cup, velcro..nada!! It does this ViNe LiKe connection purely on design shape alone- it's brilliant!!<br /><br />The simplicity of 3 dangling animal heads is plenty for baby.. Dangles includes extra items as well- giving you a 2 for 1 toy for entertainment- mirror on the flipside, rattle inclosed.. even the ends of the twist toy itself.. have “crinkle paper” inside- so, they will add a fun noise... You can tell, a lot of thought went into such a simple item. When babies world is explored by sight, sound and color stimulation- this offers up the trifecta! I am using with 3 month-old who's just now discovered- he is surrounded by objects (crazy when that happens!) This toy gets his attention + keeps him entertained for small segments of time- just long enough for me to empty a dishwasher or, start load of laundry -which is a priceless gift as we've all come to know!<br /><br />Best part of all… As he grows, he will be able to interact on different levels with this and therefore, it's a toy that can grow with him- just another priceless perk!!  I am loving this can be Tweaked and feel I must share my **HACK: as baby tires or, becomes bored with this toy, just find smaller light up/noise making toys that you can clip to this spiral.. it doesn't have to look pretty- it just has to offer more variety of “whistles and bells” and with the ease and convenience of how this attaches to things.. it's worth finding those few extra items to clip on! Translation: It will basically be giving you a ton of extra mileage out of one single item- (an item prices under $15- mind you!!)<br /><br />How does it work exactly? Well, that's what's so great.. in photos I included you can see the full structural body.. picture you holding from one end- and letting it hang (you can almost hear the boing-boing sensation it has going on!) but, as the spiral separates, you simply twist those around any object.. You can even just intertwine around any stationary object bc, there is no wrong way to attach this.. it just needs an item to vine onto!! I will say this appears in size + style to be designed for stroller, car seat, crib rail bar/handle - but, get creative.. you can see I've strung it up the leg of floor activity gym.. or, bouncy chair as well! Baby can even play with it attached to nothing- options galore!<br />Only downside, items do not detach so, washing is a bit tricky.. personally, I use baby safe (all organic chemicals) wipe Cleaners.. and just give a good wipe down and let it air dry. But, this doesn't have ability to toss into washing machine.. not that I'd feel confident to try w/out damaging toy itself.<br /><br />This is a great gift to get early on in baby phase.. that way, you can get plenty of use throughout the first yr.+  I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "Wow! Having a son who is an intermediate participant in the fingerboard world… I thought this would be a fun addition to his collection. He loved the fact that he got to build four boards in a row!! That includes the placement of trucks, wheels, stickers… However, for any who like to use fingerboards to do “skate tricks“ in some capable ability- this is not a set for you!! No, you cannot Ollie a ladder or, wooden plank or, snowboard made of a bulky plastic- as, they are quite long and cumbersome… some, a bit heavy. The rail and ramp included, can be used to slide item up and down or along- but, for someone who's been playing with fingerboards the past few years, he has taken his skill passed that level and then some! No he's not going to make a living at it… this is like playing with a yo-yo or a Rubik cube.. even a fidget toy- but like any practiced past time, you get better skills over the span of a few yrs. So, mine was less than impressed after the building took place.<br /><br />These would be fun for imaginary play- Kids could pretend roll around or get creative… The only issue with that, is the small intricate details in assembling. Not difficult in the instruction per se… But in the level of small nuts, bolts, screws- about the size of eyeglass hardware.. Now, you might be able to see my concern with younger kids! If an adult is willing to help assemble… Then, you may have a fun set that will keep your younger children entertained?!<br />Tbh, I see these in that Imaginary play genre or, possibly for one who likes to collect the unique fingerboard items.. then, this may be for you! Personally, I was hoping my son would gain 4 new fingerboards that he could excel doing tricks he likes to do with these gadgets..NoT as a profession but, as a fun past time!! (I don't know many professional yo-yo users either… But, if you can justify having fun with that- then, you may be able to understand fingerboarding!)<br /><br />The gimmicky boards are neither, here nor there and the ramp included is simple plastic.. ehh. I will say, the rail included can be used with other boards and it's made quite solid- it is trick worthy for sure. I've purchased a rail in the past separately for approximately $10. I'm guessing that's half of the $20 price point- The oversize “wheel case“ it comes in is sort of fun and could be used as display or, even to contain ones collection- it would just depend on the recipient. The surprise inside gimmick is one us parents “love to hate..” Think buying a deck of Pokémon cards, we all think it's going to be the mother load of “ amazing collector cards“ and we end up buying endless packs- to end up with a million mediocre cards... But, it is what it is! I believe there's a total of eight various items one could receive. (it seems there's always that specific one your child is after… And never get it on the first go around!) that's up to the person buying how much they want to invest in getting the entire collection.<br />Overall, it gave our fingerboard enthusiast an hour worth of entertainment. There are a few perks that came with it but, not something suited for him as a repeat purchase. He is past this level yet, this could be fun for beginners or creative minds at play!? I hope this info can help in your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "Love this! What a fun and creative way to let our little people grow, nurture and stimulate their brain. We all know this is key to their development and those little ones with active stimulation prove to develop faster in this area..  What better way to do this then, with a bright and inviting wooden stackable puzzle of sorts!?<br /><br />This is a great starting point to help little ones gain a handful of different skills… The painted blocks allow for creative thinking, picture replicating-(they can mimic one of the 10+ shapes and patterns provided), increases hand/eye coordination, and practices great finger/grip dexterity. Not to mention, this helps works on their ability to gain patience as they trial/error their way through to their final creation.. Remember, there can be no wrong end results.. just ask Picasso!!<br /><br />This is fabulous for beginning stacking skills, as this has small wooden posts to stack blocks upon- (Yep! Blocks have a hole drilled into them!) which will help immensely as little ones gain their talents. The base structure will help cut out major frustration of knocking over a masterpiece.. and trust me on this one, it matters!!<br /><br />As for the physical product itself.. (i'd love to attach a photo only, I'm not given an option.) But, the size of the blocks are compatible to the tiny hands this is intended for, making it easy to grip and hold onto. **Better yet, pieces are not small enough to pop into the mouth and create a chocking hazard- like it's distant cousin the Lego can do! Edges are smoothly sanded so, no splinter or slivers.. and the non toxic paint gives a smooth coated finish- which allows you to wipe blocks  off without worry of ruining the wood itself! These blocks are color painted on all sides to allow for the variation in designs.. So, it may seem a bit more challenging as to which side or direction to stack each piece.. but, not really!  The “block puzzle” has only 12 pieces to create any of the set shapes.. and the physicalLy cut differences in these shapes, really make this a “doable” puzzle to learn and grow with.<br /><br />This is a one stop shop of a toy item! Beginning with grasping and beginning stacking for the 1+yr. age... as they grow, they'll learn to stack in order and create replicas 2+yrs. From there, the cognitive design will begin to take root.. Making this a gift that works on many levels and adapts along with their skill set. Hack: this makes for great decor in a nursery just by setting it on a shelf and displaying the fun animal character. So, when not in use your gaining a fun accessory to look at.. it's a win/win big time!<br />I purchased for my sister who's welcoming her first baby with her husband from Ghana.. such a great way to bring a part of his world into their Americanized home. Priced under $20- this is a quality item.. one I'm certain will be enjoyed for years to come..<br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",

    "title": "Great set for beginners! Perfect alternative to Video games and use creativity!!!",
    "text": "Great for beginners who want to try marble run building or, for any who may have shown a peaked interest in the idea.. This is a great starting point without making a serious investment of money or, supplies until certain this is something that will be enjoyed. This is a good size starter set to get you going-  one can definitely build quite a fun variety of ideas with just this set alone.. this complete set will provide all pieces needed to create a run start to finish.. any add-on's are just that, extra perks and bigger creations!! (Fun but, not necessary..)<br />The box comes with a few ideas to get you started- But, I suggest googling building ideas online as, the options are endless.<br /><br />This can be enjoyed by any age (OK, any age that knows not to put a marble in their mouth! Simple rules of parenting apply marble= chocking hazard.)<br />The only other item necessary to get going.. is a flat surface and that's simply due to the laws of science that apply!! Sturdy surface is a must- **IF, you want to save endless frustration. Parents take note of this- and spare an unnecessary meltdown, no carpet is flat enough.. trust me on this one!<br /><br />Being sold at a lower price point- I personally feel these are made with a quality geared for the juvenile/beginner level and not the “official marble track building enthusiast!” *Major life hack: for any parent who must help their child create a Rube Goldberg science project (endless continual string of events that keep triggering the next step to happen?) Yep! The one worth 1/2 the childs science grade.. the assignment that gets saved till the last minute (even though Instruction came home on colored paper and you swore you wouldn't put it off!) ..it's the assignment parents end up doing 99% of the work, the work that must all be caught on film- WoW!! Just typing it out brought me such flashbacks of angst.. PTSD from science class!!!? Well, this could help with that assignment..!!<br /><br />My only drawback with this overall set:  I wish the base/foundation piece(x4 of them) were a bit weighted or, made to be a bit more solid. I feel with the market for these type of sets applying to younger crowds, it would lend a much needed safety to those with a higher probability of bumping it over. *Last hack: we have used small 1” slices of gorilla/duct tape..and do so to securely steady the base. That way as kids build, those oops and bumps- won't topple down due to a wobbly first layer! Trust me on this one.. it saves us many of tears!<br /><br />Although, this may sound a little ominous… It is not!! Just know your audience and use a hack or two listed, to help the building be a success. These are a great gift idea for any who love to create, build Legos, stack dominoes, Minecraft, etc.. in our house, my son likes to incorporate all of the above listed! A trifecta of fun.. and what's so great about a set like this… It gets kids off of technology and provides them a way to exercise their creativity! And that is a winner if, there ever was one.. for the price point- you can't go wrong with this as an “investigation piece!” A great starting point to see if they have interest and tbh, who wouldn't! These are actually a lot of fun!!!<br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "These are perfect! I was hesitant ordering a new set that didn't come with our actual brand name cornhole board set- (we left our set outdoors by accident.. And much to our dismay- someone stole them!?? Really.... Why?!!)<br /><br />So, having to replace with a quality set.. one that could withstand the use/abuse we put these thru- We took a chance and ordered the TOYSHARING patriotic Replacement set.. and they're awesome!!!<br /><br />Material used is durable and strong- it is weather treated which is awesome.. bc, we do play rain or shine.. and as you may have figured, with kids playing the game- sometime, they dont cleanup and it gets left out in the yard.. So, weather worthy material- is key!!<br /><br />Not only can these stand up to the elements. But, material used does make these strong enough to endure wear/tear!! Not impossible for a bag to be tossed into a nearby bush, by sheer lack of ”overthrow” (like I said, we play with kids a lot!) and they seem durable to withstand an accidental slide on pavement.. depending on where game is played! Bag seems reinforced by sewing, doubled with strong quality material- corners are tucked in and sewn very similar, if not the same grade and quality as original set that lasted 3yrs!<br /><br />No! We don't use everyday!!! In our house it's very seasonal.. we go thru phases of being obsessed with game- but, it does see it's fair share of action.. just not everyday- Hoping this gives an idea of use to compare these too the use at your house! Knowing how long a set of toss-bags can last, I feel content if, needing to purchase a replacement set every few years. (If not stolen- we'd still use old set!)<br />Love the pattern- stars/stripes.. red/blue!! Easy to know who's toss bag is who's! These can also be an add-on to a set.. giving the ability to let more then 2 people play a time. Or, if making your own boards/toss game at home.. these toss-bags are great for any the need.<br />The pull string bag these arrive in is a nice bonus- it makes for easy clean up and storage.. then, when playing at a later time, all supplies are easy to find-<br /><br />(Hack: on our original set we'd developed a hole in x1 bag soon after purchase.. we did apply a canvas tent patch directly over the tear- and it held up till they went missing! A little hack to help if ever you do get a trouble spot on x1.. worth a try to fix before buying entire new set!)<br />Hope this info. Helps.. feel free to let me know!",

Just like the photo! only, it is a must to place a rubber stop/anti-scratch mechanism on the bottom of each of these Platforms. Problem is, once this arrives… you want to use. Yet, You realize you need to purchase anti-scratch pad (furniture protectors) separately! A nice rubber self-adhesive protector needs to be part of this purchase! It would make all the difference-<br />***03/24 UPDATE: I was actually contacted by the seller who informed me, protector pads should have been included with the purchase and placed inside the box when mailing this item. For some reason, ours were not included.. BUT, I appreciate the contact to let me know, this was an oversight. So, when ordering the rail you should receive pads with the purchase!! Good- bc, you will need them!<br /><br />We did use a self-adhesive rubber dot for each platform… (about the size of a nickel) This stick right onto the base (x2) but, it will then keep the metal rail from scratching any surface as well as, slipping when they skate the mini finger skateboard across it!!<br />This is as simple and straightforward as it looks… A solid metal bar welded to the bottom of two bases. This is a sturdy piece- the base feels strong enough at the welding points and is nice quality, no jagged edges at all..<br />For price, I just would expect/appreciate an all inclusive- “everything I need to use” to be included upon its arrival. If protectors came in the package.. then, the user could choose on their own to use none scratch/slip pads or not.<br /><br />In the end, The recipient being my teenage son was a happy camper and that's what matters most!!<br /><br />I hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!",

Craziest thing… almost a year later, when we went On vacation and met up for dinner at the house I sent this too..(can you follow that..?!) to my happy surprise- they were all playing awkward turtles!! Yep, the game I had sent to them almost a year prior!! (could have been contrived Sure-but, from the wear and tear on the game… I knew they had been using it all along.)<br /><br />Of course, we went to have Dinner with the adults at the house.. But, their group of teen/20+ yr olds were laughing hysterically in the other room having “game night“ and I promise, they were having way more fun than we were!!<br /><br />I peaked in on the gameplaying and the concept looked pretty straightforward. Basically, divided into two teams… One member has an awkward word and tries to describe it to their team- if guessed correctly they get points! And the game sort of back-and-forths from there… Funny, quirky, annoying, cringe worthy, racy words all make up the options.. These kids were playing the game when we arrived- 2hr. Later we left... And they were still playing! (No! Not the same round but, plenty of rounds and all entertained long enough to still be having fun hours later.)<br /><br />To me, this is the best type of endorsement one can have… Seeing a game in action and hearing the laughter as it was being played. This told me all I needed to know… The game was a hit for the crowd at hand- it kept them happily playing for hours. Combined it with the ease of which it takes to “learn” the game..

The size of the set is perfect for distracting and getting kids away from electronics and video games… yet, it's sized perfect to complete in one sitting. I love the size for the price point as well as, the amount of time it can distract them. Some of these sets offer less building opportunity but, this was great (maybe it's because he loves the subject of the set?) he actually built this and set it on the desk next to his video game system. It is small and sturdy enough to do that… It makes great Minecraft Decor for any kiddos bedroom- I will admit some Legos left out tend to be more fragile than others but, this does not have too many intricate pieces and is great on display!<br /><br />This was not too difficult of a build and I feel, anyone age appropriate with the dexterity or, with intermediate skills could do without issue.

Hooking things to Bluetooth/android/iPhone becomes a little complex… When reality is, I just want to sing!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />The case this comes in, is amazing.. and a Godsend. When buying a device that uses cord, attachments, instructions, Charger and replacement parts… (Along with the fact, the device is a bit fragile-) nothing is better then, a sturdy and compact case to corral and carry all the parts.. and store them safely together for future use! This zip case is made just for the Karaoke microphone. It has a cutout to place the actual mic. itself and a pocket for smaller parts!<br />All buttons are easily marked on the mic. and easy to see and use. Bonus… You can purchase an SD chip separately, to record your masterpiece and future Justin Bieber duet!! We however have not taken this toy/device to that next level… (i would consider us still at the novice side of things!)<br /><br />Various buttons can alter and enhance the sound of even the most tone deaf! Some choices enhance  singing quality and some are just being funny- and it will surprise you which mode you find each artists chooses to belt out their tunes in..<br /><br />Mic. We got was in rose gold!! It is pretty swanky I must say- my kids added a few bedazzled rhinestones to bling out there look… However, it's  Awesomely great just as it comes.

It comes with..) and it also includes both, a charge cord as well as- a cord to plug into headphones on a cell phone too!<br /><br />Speaking of sound quality- NO!! You're Probably  not going to belt out Mariah Carey/Taylor Swift studio recording album Quality… Yet, you will end up with hours of fun and most likely, end up like we did- fighting for turns to sing our song.<br /><br />Improvements needed:<br />My only complaint is with instruction. There are separate perks for android over an iphone- And yet, the instructions are a bit vague in explaining what those are and this would be best.. if it included 2 separate sets of info. One full description for iPhone and then again, one full description for android. One page explaining different points for different phones… Was not working for us at all!!<br />The other piece of advice, list more detailed info pertaining to the compatible Apps this can coincide with- and don't just assume the user knows what these are by “one quirky word” reference! (Sorry, some of us are a bit older and need the extra details!!) if not- How will I ever conduct my very own Carpool Karaoke?!! I am certain my high school boy would be so glad if I had the skills… Ha!!<br /><br />Overall, the price point of $30 is spot on and a very reasonable good deal for the product you will receive. My youngest is High School and male… So a little too cool to admit this is fun- my 2 college age girls are fighting who gets to take it back to the dorms with them after Xmas break!?!!

    "text": "Ok, let me tell you.. I bought this for my son and his girlfriend who spent 3 weeks this summer touring Egypt for the very first time! What a perfect year for a perfect game that includes Gods pharaohs, slaves, the Nile, burials, etc..<br /><br />Before, I begin I tried to piece together a loose definition of a WORKER PLACEMENT GAME:<br />Most worker placement games involve resource management + player strategy.. and these choices will vary the outcome each time this game is played. Most often universal starting actions or, a draw of mandatory game card (cards that impact steps/strategy as you begin) will set you on your course and determine how you react.. actions then taken by players will ultimately control the outcome of game.. (actions such as completing tasks, producing a resource, building cities, advancing in war-) all while using a strategy to generates enough victory points to win the game.<br /><br />I found this game takes longer than stated on the box… Our first round was 90+ minutes and that was with a lot of trial and error. We played game in teams of 2- all were adults and 16yr old. I'll be honest, the teenager was glad to see the 1st round come to an end and he didn't sign up for another round- it was far too complex for him!! I can't imagine seeing him and his friends sitting down to play this game. So, claiming the game is for ages 12yr to adult- it's a little bit of a stretch.. at least in our house! Our 2nd round was was a bit smoother but, it still took us about 90+ minutes to complete. The instructions are a little more intimidating then, the game actually is- I suggest the best way to begin is reading instructions out loud as a group.. And instead of endless explanation- jump into a trial round.. seeing these concepts played out as its explained/learned... helps make much more sense!<br />Trust me- we got more frustrated trying to understand what things were without ever seeing them.. once we put it into play- we had much more success!<br />This is a Great game for those who like to think and strategize… being competitive is a plus, as the games begins to reveal a winner- it instantly gets you thinking ahead.. how you will play the next round different! Trust me- you could have game night with a group of adults and this one game will be all you need to keep them content!<br />Board is colorful and a fun rendition of the Nile and ancient Egypt. Game pieces and cards are made with quality and not overly done but, pieces are clearly distinguish between one another. if you purchase this game, it definitely has the ability to become part of your board-game collection for many years to come.",

    "text": "Got this for my college kiddo- she and her friends are athlete's who can't drink during their sports season.. So, instead of heading out to parties or bars- her and friends get together and do game night!! As much as I hate to admit it- but, what a better way to kick up game night for the college kids… Make it a little racy!! (I was a bit nervous because, they do game night “coed”  yet, she told me… Being They're all such good friends, they all have a good time and after x3yr. together, no one is left to feel uncomfortable!) Whew..<br /><br />After looking at the content once opening the box, I can tell you most charade cards are innuendos- they don't have to be acted out as dirty… But, I'm assuming that's what makes it a lot more fun!!<br />Ex. of theme topics: caught with your pants down, strip tease, giving a dog a bone, photocopy your butt, office liaison.. and 100's more like these!<br /><br />From the examples above- you can see how these could be acted out in a few different ways and yes, most of them a bit dirty I'm sure! Welcome to college🤗🤭.. Personally, I think these would be a lot easier to act out with a drink or two on board, damn those NCAA rules..!!<br /><br />What I liked most of all, was not naughtiness but rather, The level of difficulty was definitely kicked up a notch or two or five! I can't even imagine how I would act out “Photocopying your butt.. or, Swinging your sack round and round” (OMG- I'm not even sure I know that's a saying to guess!) But, you can definitely see these are taken to a more difficult level to act out and guess- making it a lot more of a challenge as well!!<br /><br />Rules of the game are pretty straightforward like original Charades- these are 3 different levels of difficulty so, that is a fun addition- The harder theme that you act out, the more points you get-<br />I would definitely agree with the advertisement… This is not a game that parents want to play adult children, I can see how it can be awkward or uncomfortable… But, that's obviously left up to the individual players. Just be advised you've been warned!<br />Overall, if you have adult kids or friends that have a good sense of humor and love playing games, this would be a fun addition to the game collection.<br />**One point my daughter made was- at times it gets annoying as well as, time-consuming to explain rules of new games to newcomers etc. and this, she said is just universal… The basic concept of charades is known to everyone and has really straightforward instructions. She also said it was nice that if, your time was limited- you could shorten the amount of rounds played, keeping the game to a shorter time frame.. and/or, Letting you play more than one round in a sitting. Again, these are college athletes who are very competitive… more than one round in a sitting, lets them all fight to win.. ha! Bragging rights..!!",

If it needs to be of a little higher quality...you're better to upgrade.<br />Basically...I think it would have been more helpful to advertise toy crown with plastic pieces! cross on top is bent down on a wire and is bent into place after removing from package. The fringe frills have a mind (or should I say direction?!) of their own...they came a little tattered bc of the disheveled placement into the packing box.

I love the dance party, I love the slide/stairs, I love everything and my daughters have had tons of hours of fun with it.  The only downside is that it doesn't get smaller.  It's a big thing and it stays big so you'd better have room for it.  But it's a great addition to play time.",

    "text": "I ordered this costume for a party my daughter will be attending.  I was worried that it would be too short for her (she's 4) but it's a modest above-the-knee length.  It's polyester, and looks like it will be cool enough for the indoor summer party, but I wouldn't recommend it for Halloween unless you live in a warm climate. There are no snaps or zipper up the back, just a square of velcro, and then a long, open slit that goes to the middle of her back. It's not really a problem since it's summer and she's small, but I'd think twice if it were for an older child.<br /><br />It's a really cute dress that I can envision her wearing even after the party. It would just be a cute thing to wear (once I address the back situation, put in a button perhaps or snaps). I can't imagine it would last for more than one season, but for the price, it's perfect and I'm happy with the purchase.",

So, we bought a new one for my younger kids to get acquainted with the letters before they begin phonics. It goes well with The Letter Factory DVD. I'm not a fan of the non-letter special magnets. They have expanded it a bit since the original and it no longer just sings the Letter Factory song for each letter. It has a few phrases for each letter.

I do have a couple issues that I dislike. One is that the corner toys come off easily. And they only fit into one specific corner (each is notched differently) so the kid can take them out, but can't get them back in. The second issue is that the table is so light, it moves as they lean on it. My one year old isn't a walker- she's a cruiser. So, she pulls up on the table to play, but then as she plays and leans on the table, it moves. I have to get it in a corner if I don't want it to run away on her.

He is a lot bigger than the Schleich t-rexes we have. So far, he does seem very sturdy. My boys are not easy on their dinosaurs. My boys are 3, 4, 6, 8, ad 10. They all really like this t-rex.",

I thought that part would be difficult, but the largest bead is the &#34;body&#34;, so you just have to twist the next two beads to make the legs on either side. These are really very clever. My 12 year old daughter thinks they are super cute. As far as age, I'd say 3 or 4 through 12 or 13 would like them. They have that exciting mystery pack aspect, as well.",

Of course, they can't just make them on the fridge, they have to dump all the pieces and make them in the tin. This keeps them busy for quite a long time.

The box, however, doesn't let you see the colored bit on the bottom of the pencil, so it is really difficult to tell the color while using the box. The colors are also pretty off from the color on the bottom. Thee re hexagon shaped, so they won't roll away from you. The actual pencil “lead” seems exactly the same as standard Crayola colored pencils. I compared them side by side and they color the same. They both have fairly soft “lead”. These are sharpened better in their presharpened state. The standard Crayola colored pencil also appear to have a bit of a chalky residue on the “lead” and these don't, but I didn't find that to change how they function in any way. These look a little more high end, but color pretty much the same as a Crayola colored pencil. These don't feel like fine art quality, just hobby/craft quality. They are good for adult coloring books, which is what I got them for, so I'm happy with them. They just aren't the quality of higher end colored pencils as they are packaged to have you believe.",

It doesn't “go” with any of the other thousand car tracks we already own.

It just makes bathtime more fun for him and he is more cooperative with being bathed. Plus, it is really cute. And the doll comes with it's own little towel. You can pretend without water, but you need warm water to activate the “dirty to clean” spots.<br />I don't find the limited bath time use a bad thing. I'd rather bath toys stay in the bathroom. Just reserve this doll for bathtime only. Some dolls go in the bath. Some don't. Really, if I could change one thing about this product it would be to tone down the pink and choose another color.

Just the rocks, a tiny plastic magnifying glass, and a couple thick plastic bags. Breaking the geodes in the bag didn't work and they resorted to just hammering at the geode directly, which worked. Some were tougher to break than others, but that was part of the fun. They really liked using the included booklet to figure out which geodes they found. This was a fun activity that was both physical and educational.",

The little strawberry sack comes off and you have a baby in white pajamas with green spots. (The pajamas are not removable, but the strawberry bag is.) The strawberry bag is stitched to the back of Baby Stella. You can leave it tacked on or snip the stitch to make it completely removable. My kids think it looks more like a tomato than a strawberry. It is the perfect size for little hands. This is the size my 2 year old prefers. The polyester velour on the outside is very soft and cuddly. This product is made in China, if that matters to you.",

With a second adult to help, it went together in about 5 minutes. The instructions are very minimal, with no words, and unfortunately, not much detail. But it was easy enough to figure it out. The wheels do air up. They have regular bike tire spouts on them. The handle bars have a rubbery grip on them. The seat does adjust up higher as they grow. As it is, my two year old (who is tiny- wears 18 month clothes and weighs 24 lbs.) is a little short for the scooter. However, my 3 and 5 year olds can ride it very easily.<br />There were a couple places on the scooter where the wood was split or chipped. It doesn't effect the ride or overall look, but it is a tiny bit of a bummer. However, those are really defects I would expect in a product like this made out of wood.<br />Overall, I love it. It is a very fun balance bike and will fit him for years to come.",

We also love that the box is durable enough to keep and store the pieces in when not in use. My 3 year old and 19 month old LOVE these. My 5 year old even loves playing with them.

Then LeapFrog did what LeapFrog does and made a newer version with smaller pieces. This meant the WordWhammer, which was the next step up wouldn't work with the magnets we already had, so we abandoned this product. Now, I'm teaching my 5 and 3 year old their letter and letter sounds, so I figure I'll give Fridge Phonics another shot. The magnets are the smaller ones, but they have added more songs and options. Now, the &#34;A say 'a'&#34; isn't the only thing you hear. I think it is a little too busy now, but the boys like it. Hopefully it'll help them as they learn their letter sounds.",

    "text": "This helmet without the little gun attachment would have received 4 stars. However, they added the little gun.<br />The gun slides into either side or the top of the helmet. A push of the button shoots narrow plastic darts. The darts bend easily, so once stepped on, one of the darts would no longer go back into the gun. (Eliciting much screaming and yelling about who stepped on the dart and &#34;broke it forever!&#34;)<br />The mask itself has a light up feature. The eyebrows light up when you turn the lights on. 2 of my boys thought this was awesome. One hated the red light in his eyes.<br />The internal portion of the mask has a nose piece that sits on the kid's nose. It has rubber around it to sit comfortably. If you have a kid who is weird about things touching their nose, this mask is not for you.<br />The back adjusts horizontally and vertically, so you can get a pretty good fit on any kid. It can be made to fit my 2 year old or my 8 year old. The problem is that there are rows of little holes that have to line up with the row of little dots. My 6 and 8 year old can size it themselves, but the 2 and 4 year old come to me every time they need it sized. If someone completely unsnaps the whole thing, the 6 and 8 year old cannot get everything laced back properly. (You have to pull one strap through another and tuck the end behind a tab.)<br />Overall, the mask is okay. They enjoy playing with it. I just wish it was only a mask.",

It took so long, a few of them wandered off before freedom was actually achieved. It was far too complicated for the 2 year old to understand. He simply kept the shield closed and yelled &#34;Bam!&#34; That was the happiest any of them have been with this toy. Once the 4 and 6 year olds could get their hands on it and pull one end to open the gun then squeeze the other end to fire the gun, the fun ended and the screaming and &#34;I hate this toy!&#34; began. First, it takes almost adult strength and dexterity to pull the thing open. The yankings of a 4 and 6 year old quickly broke the mechanism that flips the gun part around toward the front. It is also ridiculously difficult, even for me, to get those guns back down into the shield. They darts are under Nerf quality. Though they are Nerf style and size, so easily replaceable. But the gun only worked for a few days before it bit the dust. Now, it is just a shield. Save yourself the trouble and just get a shield without the gun to begin with. The design is awful. It just isn't built to withstand any amount of kid use.",

I'll go ahead and save you the reading time and tell you that this board is far superior to the Dry Erase Light-Up Board. They are not equals. (I thought they would be.) If you are choosing between the two, choose this one.<br /><br />The batteries are much easier to get into this board. (In the other board, they were very frustrating.) You'll need 3 AA batteries that are not included. Plus a screwdriver to get the back open.<br /><br />This board comes with vivid dry erase markers. (The other board comes with dry erase crayons.) There is even a place on the back to store the markers. The markers are kind of a chalk/ dry erase combo type of marker. This makes them very vivid, but also much more difficult to remove than regular dry erase markers. You'll actually need water to erase the pictures. My children couldn't get their drawings off with just a cloth (which this board does not come with), but if I let them use a wet cloth to remove the drawing and then a dry cloth to dry the surface, they were able to draw and erase with ease.<br /><br />This board also has a kickstand that turns the board into a sort of tabletop easel. It also has brackets on the back to hang it on the wall. You'ld be able to use it for a menu in the kitchen or just to hang their art while the board isn't in use.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B00CI6J3QG Crayola Dry Erase Light-Up Board]] has plates that remove from the frame. This board has a closed frame. Not only does it make the product more durable, but it also makes it much more vivid in terms of lighting up the pictures. The light also has a feature that does a sort of light show, giving some \"life\" to the drawings. The light is between a clear plastic plate and the black background. You actually draw on the clear plastic plate.<br /><br />This is not a good replacement for a regular dry erase board for educational purposes.

Yes, the slide out boards give you the option of white or black background, but the white is extremely difficult to see.<br /><br />This board comes with dry erase crayons. If you've ever worked with those, you know they leave a waxy residue on the board. You'll need to clean that off after their daily use. Not between every drawing, but before they put it away for the day. I recommend washing it in dish soap- it cuts the waxy build up quickly and easily. These crayons are also ridiculously messy. They write on skin. They smear off onto skin. They are difficult to remove from the cloth of your tan sofa. (Doh!)

Your daughter-in-law will love you if you buy quiet plush Bubble Guppies instead. She'll love you even more if you spring for a nice set of blocks. Unless this toy was specifically asked for, avoid it!",

I didn't know he could love a drum more than his [[ASIN:B0002Q1XNA Remo RHYTHM CLUB, Bongos, 5/6 Diameters, Rhythm Kids Graphics]]. But he does! He loves the neck strap. He can wear his drum and play it as he marches around the house. My other kids love it, too, when they can get it away from the 2 year old. (3 year old, 5 year old, and 7 year old all think this drum is great.) And it very literally takes a beating. Great quality drum from Remo. I am not a fan of the print on the drum- it looks kind of silly- but the kids haven't seemed to notice it much at all. I will definitely be buying more Remo drums for kids!",

We thought a nicer wooden table would be a great upgrade for the kids. And they all love Thomas. (I don't know that I've even met a kid who didn't like Thomas.) But this table just failed to live up to my expectations.<br /><br />First, it was really easy to put the table together. Only a phillips head screwdriver was needed. Even with little hands \"helping\", the table was together in 10 minutes.<br /><br />I like the train storage on the underside of the side of the table. That is a very clever use of space. It also encouraged my kids to put their trains away.<br /><br />That is where my positives end.<br /><br />This table, while expensive, comes with no trains or tracks. You must purchase those things separately. I very much wish it came with a basic track and a train or two.<br /><br />The top of this table just sets into the base. It is in two pieces and they are not bolted down or held down in any way. This is very problematic for my household. Also, the top of the table isn't very sturdy. It will hold essentially no weight, so hopefully your little conductor will not get too enthusiastic and climb on top of the table. It just won't take much wear and tear for such an expensive item. I'd expect much better quality and construction.<br /><br />So now, I have to constantly monitor train table usage to make sure no one is being too rough with the table and no one is climbing under the table and bumping the table top. It is just a hassle. Perhaps the makers of Thomas the Train do not expect 3 rough little boys to be playing with their table. Not sure what these guys had in mind with this design.<br /><br />Honestly, I like the cheap Step 2 table more. My boys can be more free with it and have less controlled play.",

This drum has held up nicely, despite my toddler's rather rough playing. The mallet is pretty awful. It is foam, so it took about a day before someone took a bit out of it. Within a week, the mallet was trash. We went to a local music store and grabbed a hard rubber mallet for them to use with their drum to replace the foam one. (Why does any company make kid things out of foam? They simply cannot resist biting the squishy stuff!) The drum head is made out of plastic on this particular drum, but it makes a great sound and is very durable. The lollipop styling makes it even more fun! I absolutely recommend this drum (just be prepared to replace the mallet, you may want to go ahead and remove the mallet for younger ones because they can choke on the pieces) and will be buying more Remo Kids products in the future.",

Do yourself a favor and either use rechargable batteries or the lithium batteries.<br /><br />I like the way this soother attaches to the crib. I've had many crib soothers and this one is the best for attachment. It has a holder that attaches easily to the crib and the soother itself pops in and out so you can move it without uninstalling it every single time. (And since it is more of a toy than a soother, you'll want to move it.)<br /><br />The buttons are fairly easy to figure out, but once baby can stand or reach the thing, they can easily push the buttons themselves and cause chaos. The baby doesn't know how it works, pushes the upper buttons and makes the image on the screen change, then baby gets mad because they want their image back and they've got no clue how to do it. But you can't get them to stop pushing the buttons.<br /><br />The remote only turns the thing off or on. It can't change the image or pull up one of the scenes. So, if baby hits those blasted buttons and changes the scene and gets mad about that, you can't use the remote to fix that. You can only turn the soother off or on.

So, although the primary purpose of this toy is vanity, I like the creative and artistic aspect of it. My 6 year old daughter was thrilled when she saw it. The packaging leaves much to be desired. It is a clamshell package. I took it out, showed her how it worked, and set her to work on creating some outfits. There are 3 bottom plates (6 options), 3 top plates (6 options), and 3 head plates (6 options).  All the plates fit inside a little drawer. It comes with one crayon to rub with an attachment so you don't have to get your fingers all messy and 4 colored pencils.<br /><br />This is super cheap quality. The lid only closes (on the top) when you have the drawer pushed in. The plates themselves are not exactly even, they are a bit warped and don't lay flat. The drawing area is too small for a regular sheet of paper, but slightly larger than half a sheet of paper. You cut paper in half to use half sheets and they slide around a bit in the top area. Since the plates are a bit warped, you can't get a good rubbing of the pictures. (One skirt and top is polka dotted and not even half the dots will transfer to the paper.) The top is difficult to open. It also easily pops off on the opposite side that should not be opening. The eyes usually don't transfer to the rubbing either.<br /><br />The colored pencils it comes with are pretty poor quality and not good color choices. (Brown, indigo, light pink, and yellow.) They don't have very much pigment in them and you're coloring on top of a rubbing, so you need much more vivid pencils than it comes with.<br /><br />Within about 20 minutes of use, my 6 year old had already found the duct tape and taped the lid down. She likes the product and said other girls would like it too, just use duct tape.",
