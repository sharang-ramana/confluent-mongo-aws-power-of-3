YAY I was so excited, pulling weeds and climbing as little Toad... there are tons more games on it, not sure if I ever go through them or play them all, but there is a huge selection. My husband found some game he played as a teen and got all nostalic too. The controllers are SNES style, so my old NES hands need to get used to the buttons being sloped, but oh well...<br /><br />There are plenty of other consoles out there that are way cheaper (I'm still trying to return one of those with no mario, really a hassle) but the price of this one is totally worth it!

The score quickly showed that the experienced players built a huge lead and turned the score into a race.  The other two enjoyed the game, but both admitted that the complexity of the options had slowed their progress.<br /><br />This is not for those who can get analysis paralysis, but it is a great game and I expect it to become a regular game in my rotation of what I bring to the table.",

It's a lot of information, but the sprues do have identification numbers imprinted to make it easier to figure out which pieces go together.<br /><br />The box also includes a sheet of transfers you can add to things like the battle standard to give your army a bit of detail.  Its simple, but nice to see..<br /><br />The big issue most will have is the price.  This is 10 figures and the MSRP makes it so its $6.00 per plastic figurine, and that's without paint, glue or the time involved in assembly.  But these are your basic line troops for the Daughters, and you will need them to assemble most armies of this faction.  (You can have an army general allowing medusae to be your line troops, but they are even more expensive.)<br /><br />Then again, no one ever said Warhammer was an inexpensive hobby.  If you like the army, go for it.  I'd just recommend at least reviewing the army codex first so you have an idea what you are getting into, or if your local game shop has resumed holding matches, go and talk to players to get an idea of what faction might be right for you.",

I haven't played enough to know all the nuances of the game, so I tend to struggle to get the engine started and running early.  And this is definitely an \"engine-building\" game where the actions you take build on all actions you took in previous turns.

The characters have good skills that make each one play differently, but in a fun way.  The locations add a bit of strategy to the play, and the villains are difficult, but not overwhelming like ones from the crisis expansion can be.  I'd recommend this or the full base game if you want to start collecting this.<br /><br />I will note that this game plays very similar to Ascension in some ways, and while you are playing a hero working to defeat a super villain, there isn't a lot of teamwork and you don't end up with a deck themed to your hero unless you purchase cards in that manner.  It thins the theme a bit.  But overall, I still like this game, its fun and can be played quickly by most players.",

The game plays with one person taking on the role of &#34;dark overlord&#34;.  They will start and end each round.  they start it by looking at one of the other players and basically asking why their most recent plot failed.<br /><br />But after that the imagination takes over.  The minions goal is to avoid the blame.  They do this by playing hint and action cards.  Hint cards give them a hint as to what their excuse is for the failure.  Perhaps they ran into a monster (like &#34;the puppy&#34;, perhaps they ended up at the wrong location &#34;the lonely tower&#34; or even a wild event happened &#34;the whirlwind&#34;)  the player will use the hint to start telling a story as to why the group failed.  He will also play a &#34;pass the buck&#34; action card to move the blame to another player.<br /><br />Players can insert themselves into the process by playing &#34;freeze&#34; actions, This allows them to say &#34;Actually Dark Overlord, that statement is not quite true&#34; and to change it slightly forcing the minion currently being grilled to modify their tale.<br /><br />It's all about storytelling and thinking quickly.  Failure to respond promptly is one of the failures that allows the Dark Overlord to command for silence and give the minion a &#34;withering look&#34;  When one player gets 3 withering looks the game ends.  Other failures can be for not having a pass the buck card, boring the dark overlord or not using the information on the hint card well enough.<br /><br />There is a variant of the game which uses some additional symbols on the cards to make the storytelling a bit less a part of the game, but they don't take away from the idea that this is a fun, frantic game where the goal is to not be the odd minion out when the Dark Overlord decides someone must pay for the failure.<br /><br />It's a great party game with people who enjoy storytelling and can think quick on their feet.  But it does require some people.  The game says 3-8 players, but less than 5 will almost always turn the game into a beatdown on one poor minion.",

It has some randomizers in that everything is presented through shuffled decks of cards  (intrigues, quests and buildings)  and that randomness can make what seems like a great strategy ultimately fail when the quest you need doesn't show up.<br /><br />I think I like this a bit more than Stone Age.  Lords of Waterdeep offers a lot more strategy than other worker placement games thanks to the quests since the players have some ability to choose which quests to undertake.  Also controlling which building gets built can have a huge effect on the outcome as the buildings tend to be far more powerful than the base locations that are available at the start of the game.<br /><br />This game isn't for everyone, but a love and knowledge of Dungeons and Dragons is not required  (it adds flavor only).

    "text": "Many deck building games play a bit like solitaire where what you do has little to no effect on the other players.  The game immediately breaks that mold as you not only purchase cards to improve your own deck, but are purchasing cards to send to another players deck.  Strategies that were part of other deck building games are useless here as you don't have the same level of control.<br /><br />The game itself is very simple and staightforward.  Cards produce 2 forms of \"gold\" (friendship and nightmare).  Friendship purchases schoolgirls who go into your own deck to help fight against the chthonic teachers of the school.  Nightmare purchases teachers who go into the deck of the player on your left and will be torturing his students until madness overtakes him and he loses the game.  At least he does if you haven't gone mad first.<br /><br />The battles are equally simple.  Teachers have scores for how tough they are and how frightening they are while the girls have scores for how strong they are at defeating teachers.  Sanity is lost if the teachers win the battle during a players turn.<br /><br />And that is how it works.  deckbuilding becomes a balancing act of gathering the cards that produce the most nightmarish power to send evil teachers to your opponent while supplying enough friendship to purchase the tougher schoolgirls to battle the nightmares that find their way into your deck.  Unlike other deckbuilding games the actions of your opponents now directly affect you and mold your strategies.<br /><br />The game itself isn't hte highest quality.  The cards feel a bit flimsy and the artwork is a bit more cartoonish than I like, but those are minor issues.  Overall its a simple concept and a cimple game with a short rulebook that is easy to understand.  Good fun can be had playing this game.",

    "text": "This game is built around the premise that the players have discovered that a new railroad is going to be passing through the town.  Each player is a nearby rancher who decides that they want to \"own\" the town and be able to take advantage of the huge influx of goods and gold that the railroad might bring.<br /><br />IN the game you do this by taking control over locatoins in town.  At first the town is rather small with only a few buildings, but each turn will add additional buildings.  Control of a building gives a player special powers that can be used as long as they keep one of their gunhands in the building to protect it.<br /><br />The play itself is rather simple.  Each turn has set steps and the scoring and winning conditions are easy to remmeber.<br /><br />However, Deadwood is best as a game for 4 people.  With 3 the game often becomes a beatdown of one player by the other two.<br /><br />This is a fun game, but hardly rises up to the level of hte better euro-game and strategy games out there.  The idea is nice, but I never fell in love with this game.",

    "text": "This isn't a hugely complex game.  Each player is given a board showing the base zoon and a few coins they can spend for some special actions.  The turn starts with a number of empty \"trucks\" sitting on the table, equal to the number of players.  Each player can then.<br /><br />1) spend coins to expand their zoo or move animals within their zoo<br />2) draw a tile from the bag.  This tile then must be placed on one of the trucks.  each \"truck\" can contain up to three tiles<br />3) take a truck and put the tiles that were on the truck into their zoo,  [after doing this the player is out until all players have claimed trucks]<br /><br />Strategy comes in because you cannot min animals in an enclosure and the basic zoo only has 3 enclusures, although putting a male and female animal of the same species in an enclosure with extra space will result in a baby animal being bred.<br /><br />the game continues until there are less than 15 tiles left, at which time points are scored based on how full the zoo's enclosures are.  Penalty points are taken away for having animals in the warehouse.<br /><br />And that's the basic game.  Not complex, but easy to describe and teach.<br /><br />With good players the game goes fast, as the only real strategy is guessing when someone else might claim a \"truck\" you are trying to build up with the right animals for your zoo.  You learn to pay attention to who is collecting which animals.<br /><br />Sadly, I can't call this a classic game.  It's plays a bit too much like a solitare game as the direct interactions are limited. It's not a bad party game as the simple rules will allow teenagers to play, but it can be slow, so I cannot recommend it for the 6-9 year old crowd.<br /><br />This is definitely more of a gateway game.  Good to get people interested in strategy and euro-games, but not necessarily the best game for long term playing.  Unless you have a very patient group of friends this game will eventually seem a bit less exciting.",

There is no direct conflict in this game.  You won't see people throwing dice because two warriors from the tribes faced off in a fight.<br /><br />But strategy and tactics are vital in this game.<br /><br />The key is how this game becomes a resource acquisition and dispersal game.  You start out with a limited number of people.  They can be sent to various spots on the board.  Some spots allow you to roll dice and acquire resources.  Others spend resources on buildings or civilization improvements (victory points.).  You can even send workers to permanently increase food production, make tools or make another worker.<br /><br />However, there are limitations.  The \"love shack\", food production and tool production spots can only host one tribe each turn.  The resource spots allow 7 total tribesmen.  If your opponents swarm into the forest first you might end up having to send your people to collect brick, which usually means less resources that turn as wood is easier to gather.<br /><br />Strategy plays out as you decide where to send your people.  You have to make the best use of your opportunities, but also make sure to disrupt your opponents when possible.<br /><br />It's easy to learn, but will not become boring too quickly as your opponents try tew strategies to defeat you.",

    "text": "I've played a lot of different card games.  My first intro to deck-building was Dominion and I immediately liked the concept even while I noticed that there were just a few strategies that would be played.  So far I've played mroe than 10 games and they all follow about the same victory path even if the 10 card piles change.  There are just only so many ways to win.<br /><br />Tanto Cuore is very similar to Dominion in that you start with 7 love cards (copper in Dominion) and 3 maid chief cards (Estates in Dominion)  From this small start you are expected to eventually build a winning deck, by using the love cards to employ maids from the 10 selectable piles.  The maids the become cards that can give you additional draws, love for hiring other maids or even allow you to play more than one maid per turn.  Simple in concept and easy to learn.<br /><br />Where Tanto goes beyond Dominion is that some of the maids who have actions also give victory points, and then to add more strategy you can increase the number of points by sending some maids to your private chambers.  This removes them from your deck, but gives bonus VP when the game ends.  Dominion does not have this element.  Some of the maid combinations that can be \"chambermaided\" are worth more points than the regular VP maids and are much less expensive to purchase into your deck.  It adds an additional strategy and more possibilities.<br /><br />Add in the \"private maids\" who act like a free action card that activates once a turn, and you have a game with a bit more depth than Dominion.  My only complaint would be that this first set only has 16 different general maids, where the base set for dominion has 25 buildings.  Tanto Cuore does not have quite as much flexibility as Dominion due to that.<br /><br />The other nice element is the packaging and cards.  Tanto Cuore comes in a nicely decorated card box.  Its sized to hold the cards comfortably even if they are sleeved and includes thick cardboard dividers each divicer has a picture of one of the cards in the set, making the initial sorting much easier.  The cards are on thick plastic stock rather than the flimsy feeling paper of Dominion.<br /><br />As long as you don't dislike anime or the idea of hiring maids, this is a good deck building game, the makers put some effort into making the game challenging and fun, and it shows.",

Even in this first set, the puns are everywhere and the game is more about having fun and socailizing than winning.  Sure it almost requires that you backstab each other freely, but its also the kind of fast paced and humorous game that keeps the players from becoming too serious about what's happening.

There are considerably higher quotes on line, such as Rakuten's $850.99.<br /><br />My grandnephew (age 7) is salivating over this toy, so I did some research.  It's available as a back order item through the Lego Shop for $399 (shipping included).  To save $80 to $500, it's worth waiting until Lego has it available to ship again.  I'm old enough to remember when Tickle Me Elmo sold for $2,000 while it was in short supply, and the prices dropped to normal after the manufacturer caught up with the demand.<br /><br />Over the past two or three years, my grandnephew has enjoyed working with numerous Lego toys, and I've concluded that for the 3,803 pieces inside this 10188 model box, which includes several other little toys that need assembling, $400 is probably a fair price for many hours of fun.<br /><br />One other comment: the Amazon box display suggests that this toy is for Age 12+ while the Lego shop display says 14+.  One teenager didn't find it challenging enough, but lots of fun.  A man in his thirties said that it took him twelve to fourteen hours to assemble.  Keeping a kid engaged for that amount of time must be priceless, so yes it could be worth $400 to the parents' peace of mind.  I already placed the pre-order, but we're offering it to teach the child a lesson - he's been instructed to save for the toy.  So far, he has twenty bucks; it's a start.<br /><br />UPDATE: Lego delivered the Death Star on July 22 and 23 2014 for my grandnephew and for a ten year old girl who also enjoys assembling toys.  So, it appears that the Lego warehouses are stocking for the holiday season.  Perhaps because I placed more than one order, they discounted $30 off each, mailing was free, Lego purchases earn VIP points that can be used toward other Lego orders, and they sent discount tickets for Lego Land.  The downside for the kids: the grandparents are holding the toys until their birthday or Christmas.  I was informed that each box is huge and weighs 26 lbs.",

    "text": "As far as perplexuses (perplexi?) go, it's pretty good. It has a few fun features like the X-wing. But I was so very disappointed when I finally got to the end and dropped the ball into the core and...... Nothing. No lights or sound. I expected all the lights to flash and for there to be some kind of explosive sound effect when you &#34;destroy the death star&#34; What a disappointment! It has lights and sound effects when you don't want them (randomly startling you as you play!) but nothing for the finale. Also the numbers are REALLY hard to read. More than in other models. And the pattern stamped into the globe to mimic the death star actually makes it much harder to see what you are doing. That said, my friend who has vision problems said using it helped exercise her eyes! So maybe it's a good thing?",

The shaft that holds the 3 gears is too wobbly and unsteady to work properly. The elevator lift does not lift high enough to get the ball onto the ramps, not low enough to grab another ball. And the gear that carries the ball over and onto the higher ramp only works 1 in ever 5 times. And the holes to allow the ball to pass through were too small to work, so we had to file the piece for quite a while. (I assume that was a flaw in the wood??) We watched videos online and retraced our steps, to no avail. We googled ideas to problem solve and found nothing helpful. We had all of the pieces and the learning experience was good.

    "text": "What it is:<br /><br />1. A multipurpose alien spaceship, which allows kids to create different types of aliens using the half-molds provided, and save them in the transparent pods.<br />2. Tubs of \"meteor mud\" to make the desired alien imprint.<br />3. Tubes of \"lunar lava\" gel to make the aliens.<br />4. Implements, with which you can probe, flatten and otherwise annihilate the alien population.<br />5. A light-up display with a volcano which can be used to squish aliens. (Batteries included)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Very easy to use and set up, and even smaller kids can use it with supervision.<br />2. The \"meteor mud\" (A modeling clay/play-doh combination) is reusable.<br />3. Can make up to 90 different aliens<br />4. Fun to dissect, squish and mutilate, especially when their innards are still gooey and runny.<br />5. Unlike Ripley's Aliens, these are created non-invasively, painlessly and relatively mess-free.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. The aliens are itsy bitsy and teenie weenie (yellow polka dot bikinis optional)<br />2. There's only one creation chamber, and each alien takes five minutes to set, so there's a lot of waiting time, which seems longer when several kids are playing \"mad scientist\".<br />3. Some aliens are harmed in the extraction process from the \"meteor mud\"<br />4. The novelty wears off pretty quickly, but should buy you a few hours of peace and quiet while your progeny create and destroy defenseless alien life forms.<br /><br />Recommended for children who like to squish things, future astronauts, budding mad scientists, or anybody past the age of five.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 19, 2009",

It's okay to a point once you're using the coloring pages or stencils supplied, but doesn't encourage self-expression or creativity.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. No mess, other than the occasional splatter of white stuff, which is easy to clean up.<br />2. Sprayer makes a professional sounding noise<br />3. Includes three stencils, with interesting patterns<br />4. Easy to set up<br />5. Includes everything you need except batteries<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It uses FOUR \"C\" batteries (not included)<br />2. The colors only work on Crayola special paper.<br />3. The colors are pale, washed out looking tints of the colors they claim to be<br />4. The colors don't show up immediately, and as a result, kids tend to spray the same area over and over again, causing a wet spot<br />5. The coloring pages are specially created so that the paint only sticks to specific areas, thereby guaranteeing a good finish.  Similarly, the stencils only let through the paint in the right places. Kids can draw their own images using the markers and crayon, but it's impossible to keep the spray within the lines, resulting in major frustration for kids who want to express themselves beyond the coloring pages and stencils.<br /><br />Recommended only for short term entertainment, when you don't feel like cleaning up afterwards.

There's also a clip of a lamp and fan in series, showing that the fan takes a while to turn at full speed because of inertia.<br /><br />There are also games, sirens, projects activated by clapping or light, and projects that introduce digital circuits.

Even though set-up is relatively easy, kids may need some help in putting it together, connecting it to the TV and bringing the bionic eye into focus.<br />a. The lens attachment has to be placed over the bionic eye, and twisted until the red groove is aligned with the arrows.<br />b. This toy needs five AA batteries for the \"brain case\"<br />c. It needs to be connected to the TV video input<br />d. It has to be focused using the focusing disc (included) before use<br /><br />2. It's not for smaller children who may shine the LED light in their eyes<br /><br />3. It comes with a viewing tube (for looking at bugs and other small objects); a viewing dish (for stuff that needs a little more room to spread out for examination); and a base for hands free viewing.  These items are made of transparent plastic, and if you're not careful you may throw them away with the packaging.<br /><br />4. It comes with an easy to understand, illustrated instruction booklet, that's actually written in proper English, and includes a treasure hunt section.<br /><br />Good things about the EyeClops<br /><br />1. Kids will be fascinated by the 200X magnification, and are likely to spend lots of time looking for objects to view<br />2. This is a good learning tool for showing kids what everyday objects look like up close.  Hair, skin, salt, coins and banknotes, magazines, cloth and carpets are good examples, as are ants, fruit flies, shells and leaves.  You can actually see fibers in cloth, and hair and follicles in skin.<br />3. Great gross out fun when disgusting objects appear on your TV screen<br /><br />Bad things about the EyeClops<br /><br />1. The object for examination needs to be very close to the bionic eye, touching the lens attachment<br />2. You can only view objects in the proximity of the TV, up to the length of the cord.<br />3. Sometimes the image appears fuzzy and adjustments have to be made to get it into focus<br />4. Some colors view better than others<br />5. Once the batteries start running down you get lines through the image and discoloration<br />6. If you're using this with your kids - DON'T LET THEM SEE A CLOSE-UP OF YOUR SKIN.  This device clearly illustrates the aging process, and the difference between young skin and ummm older skin is very apparent.  Unless you want them laughing at you for years to come, don't show your epidermis without a fight.<br /><br />A cool educational toy for kids with a little parental guidance required.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 24, 2007",

(See my \"How To\" guide for organising an unforgettable Harry Potter party in the \"So you'd like to ...\" section)<br />The one I got came with a fancy clasp to hold the front of the cape together.  It was a little big, so I had to hem it and roll up the sleeves.  Even after hard wear and much abuse at the party it washed well, and looks like new.  He will probably still have this costume when Books 6 and 7 come out.<br />The wand is realistic, but with young children you have to watch out for them hitting other children with it, as it's pretty solid.<br />The glasses are also very authentic looking, and fits all faces (mine included).  Again you have to be careful with younger children as it tends to slide off little noses, and the glass might break.  I haven't had any problems with it mind you, but it could happen.  The lenses get dirty quickly also.<br />The transfers are a very nice touch, and they go on easily with a little water.  Even squirmy kids can be decorated without too much fuss.  They last a couple of days if you don't scrub them too hard in the bath.  I removed my son's own, because it was so realistic that people kept coming up to me asking if he had fallen and hurt his forehead. (Muggles no doubt!)<br />A great buy for your little Harry Potter",

He loves the sounds and spends lots of energy trying to make it rock as much as possible for long periods of time. This wears him down which his parents appreciate, kids have so much excess energy. It took approximately 45 minutes to assembly and was easy from start to finish. I'm sure he will get years of joy out of the horse just as our son did when he was young. It takes 3 triple A batteries and has 3 settings for the sound of off, low and loud. He enjoys the loud trotting and whinnie sounds, but the low setting is good when you need a bit more silence. The rocking motion is virtually silent, only the interactive sounds can be heard.",

Until I saw this actually flying Snitch. I had to have it - how often does something fictional truly come to life?<br /><br />It has to be charged for at least thirty minutes before you can fly it and the charge only gives you about 5 or 6 actual minutes of real flying time. Normally, that would be irritating, but I've had so much fun with the Snitch that I'm willing to overlook the short play time. The ball glows red as it's charging and stops when it's finished.<br /><br />You have to hold the Snitch perfectly vertical, press the on button on the bottom and the start button on the little remote. However, that's all the remote does as far as I can tell. The Snitch is significantly louder than expected and it's fast. If you put your hand under it as it flies by, it will move up and away. I've only used it inside and it will crash into walls or potted plants, but so far none of the crashes have damaged it. The cat is seriously infatuated with the Snitch both flying and sitting still, turned off. He's all about catching and killing the Snitch - I laughed so hard yesterday that I was crying watching the cat chase this across the house. I would totally buy a replacement if we kill this one.",

So I was tickled to see this little retro video game box with the pink bow girl chasing ghosts. There's a little joystick and the start button makes a little sound like a quarter dropping at the beginning of the game.<br /><br />However, the childlike joy sort of deflates within moments after you start playing. The maze is correct and the sounds are right, but the graphics are faint and hard to see in certain light. Additionally, the joystick is jerky and slow to respond which means Ms Pac-Man gets stuck in corners or simply doesn't turn. By the time you get the joystick jiggled just right, the ghosts are already on you. I like the retro feel, but the funtionality is pretty rough.",

The problem is the boxes each player uses are made of very thin, cheap plastic. Tipping it over and splattering the pegs everywhere is too easy. There's a removable plastic tray for the opponent's ship grid - this thing pops out unexpectedly and tosses pegs everywhere. The entire set up is very flimsy. We both remember the original game being heavier and thicker, more sturdy in general.

We're a pretty open minded and easy going group and it takes more than a few tacky questions or obscene stick figures to bother any of us. There are a lot of those things in the game, BTW.<br /><br />Our issues were related to the structure of the game and it's execution. The instructions and actual game play are overly complicated for no obvious reason. The voting and answer tiles are too small for big fingers to grip easily and it really needs a little holder for them - like for Scrabble tiles. The game itself is trying too hard to be too many things - a bit of Truth or Dare mixed with Explicit Pictionary and a little Cards Against Humanity. We found the Draw It cards elicited the most laughs and whole group engagement. My final complaint is the misspelled words on several cards! Seriously?

Flipping it upside down gives a flat surface to lie on your stomach comfortably if you are so inclined. Technically, this behemoth is too big for our small pool, but I love it anyway. It's big enough for my other big tube float to fit in it with room left over. I could see this being used as a swim out floating island in a lake etc.<br /><br />UPDATE 1 week later *****<br /><br />This float is losing air much more quickly than the blue one in the photos. I've had to add air to the center seat area three times in a week. There's no discernible leak and it's in the water all the time. The head rests are holding air fine.

But my favorite part is the easily adjustable neck strap which keeps the hat on the head. This was so easy to slide up under our cats' chins. It made it so much easier to keep a hat on their heads for photos. (I imagine you would have the same results with a baby, but don't have one handy to try it out.)<br /><br />Overall, I was very happy with these little hats.

As the mom of an adhd kid, I wish these things had existed when he was younger.<br /><br />It seems distracted kids do better with something in their hands to keep fidgeting localized, if you will.<br /><br />This toy offers several types of fidget release. If your child is throwing things, I do NOT recommend this one - it would be very painful to be hit by this.<br /><br />I think this also has some potential in a nursing home situation, especially in memory care facilities. Often, dementia or ALZ loved ones will wring their hands or grab at things. There is a chance that this item might help them with the fidgeting aspect, but not totally sure. Texture is often important as well, so it will totally depend on the individual and what they need.",

I have an ADHD son, so thought maybe these would be interesting to try.<br /><br />In my opinion, the idea behind it is great; something to do for fidgety hands. But they seem way too big! It nearly takes two hands to mess with them.<br /><br />They also don't technically have a top and bottom, but the \"pop\" works better from one side than the other. I also felt that the pop worked better while pushing up from the bottom, rather than down from the top.<br /><br />Overall, great idea. Easy to clean. Will keep fidgeters busy. The downside is that they are a little too big for subtle use or one-handed use.",

These are of course, very light weight, so they won't feel like other pieces. They have a much smaller base as well, so will not be as steady to move around the board.

The shuffler was a hand-saver.<br /><br />This shuffler is sadly all plastic. All plastic. It has a Las Vegas sticker on it to make a nod to gambling. It wasn't really needed and adds nothing.<br /><br />There are no instructions on the box or in the box. When I picked this out, I thought it would be battery operated. It is not. This is all manual. Not bad, but not specified either.<br /><br />There are two little plastic cranks on the bottom of the machine. You only need one, so I am assuming you get a spare crank. The crank fits in the back of the shuffler. You just divide your cards in half (no need to be exact), put a stack on each side, and turn the crank. The newly shuffled deck is now in the middle, in a plastic clear tray. You just slide the tray out. You can reshuffle the deck as many times as desired.<br /><br />This would be very handy for people with arthritis or other hand problems.

I guess the measurements were buried in the description, but when I saw the basic description, I was thinking finger tapping.<br /><br />This takes up about a foot of room. The drum tops are super thin plastic sheeting. Everything is, of course, some kind of plastic. The drumsticks look like Shrek's cotton swabs, made of molded gray plastic. The cymbal is silver tone and some thin metal that doesn't make much of a sound.<br /><br />Now, if I wanted to encourage my child to play a musical instrumemt, I would buy them a small REAL snare drum. I would not mess with this one, even for fun.<br /><br />I've been involved in music since I was 4 years old, so maybe I am pickier than some folks. But this thing is majorly annoying to hear. Like, smash it with a hammer and throw it away.<br />Of course, if you have someone you hate, you could give this to their kids. ;-)<br /><br />IMHO, there is more value in this one to get it for decoration, and hand-paint the drums with really nice paint, and put a glitter finish on them. Then set them on a shelf to look nice.",

    "text": "We have been using our MathShark for approximately two weeks now.<br /> I reviewed the directions and tried to pop in two new AA batteries. That is where the problems started.<br />The battery case does not slide off - it has a flat, wide screw that holds it in place, although the battery door was also warped and looked like it might not hold the batteries in place. The screw was put in at the factory in a crooked angle, so it took trying three different screwdrivers before we could remove it to get to the battery compartment. The batteries popped in without incident, and we had the same fun getting the cover back on, with the weird angled screw.<br /><br />Once that was done, we turned it on to take it for a spin. It is pretty intuitive, and honestly, the directions would almost not be needed by most people. A light flashes green if you get the right answer and red if it is wrong. You can turn off the sound effects, which is pretty much preferable at our house. It feels fairly well balanced in our adult hands, and the kids didn't seem to have much trouble with it either.<br /><br />The first thing I did not like was the screen. It is TINY compared to the size of the toy. The display fonts are extremely primitive! With so many to choose from now, this reminded me of the very early-on calculators or hand held games from the 1970's. They were hard to read many times. What made it worse is that this screen is not backlit. It is part of what makes it harder to read - a gray screen with either dark gray or light black letters and numbers. The contrast was not enough. And I don't know of any kid who doesn't like lying in bed and playing games! You sure can't do this one in a dark room, because all you'll see would be the red or green light.<br /><br />Our model also had a problem with the number zero. Once in a while, a great deal of pushing, like you are trying to push the number button out the bottom of the machine would result in a zero, but otherwise, it just didn't respond. So every answer that has a zero in it (and of course, there are many) will be counted as wrong. Your answers are also timed, so don't waste time with buttons that don't work, because it will just increase your game time and your frustration.<br /><br />There are some good things - I promise! The kids still liked it a little bit, but when they couldn't get the zero to work, they stopped playing with it. I kept trying different levels and skills just for the mental exercise. I found it was actually a bit fun to try to figure out various levels of math problems in my head, having been used to relying on a calculator so often. There are seven math skills covered in this game: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, fractions, decimals and percentages. Each math skill has eight levels that get progressively more difficult. Some of the levels were actually a little bit of a challenge for this &#34;old&#34; adult. The multiplying fractions function was a reminder of how much I'd forgotten since I didn't use it! Ha! I enjoyed the mental math and trying to get a high score, but then, I always have enjoyed any sort of computer games.<br /><br />I would suggest the following changes to the manufacturer:<br />1) Add a backlight to the screen. Evenings while bored silly or long car rides (which can be day or night) are a great time to use this item, and it is too hard to see without an abundance of light.<br />2) Update the fonts used to a more legible one. It looks like I picked this up at a garage sale circa 1980.<br />3) Use a different screw on the back battery compartment. It didn't work well at all.<br /><br />Overall, this definitely could be useful, but it is not too likely a child who has a PSP or Nintendo DS would give this much of a second glance. And with so many math games available for other gaming systems, I would think an individual handheld like this would be working overtime to make sure their item is more appealing. So, if your child doesn't have any of those other handhelds, then this would be an acceptable way to practice math skills, especially in the car. The game seems very sturdy and should survive several drops. Just test everything as soon as possible, and if you have a bad button, exchange it at your store for one that works.",

    "text": "Well, we all love the Scene it games, and have probably ten of the various versions.<br />Since we all love comedy movies, we thought this would be a natural fit for our family.<br /><br />We've played it a few times now, and I'm not sure where they dug up the movies from!<br />I'm in my 50's, and haven't even heard of some of the movies they call &#34;comedies&#34;.<br />The ones you'd think would be in there barely register a blip.<br /><br />So, be prepared for a stunning lack of current comedy movies. Maybe licensing was a lot cheaper<br />for the uber old movies than even the ones from the 1970's.  Either way, it was very disappointing,<br />and we haven't played it now for several months.  No one was enthusiastic about what should have<br />been a really fun game.",

    "text": "We all love the Scene It games and have quite a collection of them.<br />When this one was finally on sale for a reasonable price, I bought it.<br /><br />We eagerly opened it up and started playing. First off, there are only four game pieces, and they are a little strange.<br />The other problem we had with this game was the INCREDIBLY BROAD definition of &#34;comedy&#34;.<br />When I hear comedy, I think of funny movies usually with at least one comedian or comedienne in the cast.<br />There are all kinds of movies included in here (not horror, but a lot of dramas that I don't consider to be comedies.<br />There were many movies that I had never even heard of before... where do they dig this stuff up from?<br />There are plenty of comedies from which to cull the questions and clips!<br /><br />We'll keep it and try it a couple more times. We played three games the first day, and my 28-yr olds didn't know a lot of the references either.  So there are a lot of fringe knowledge, LOTS of questions about things most people are not really memorizing, like who the director was (lots of director questions!), or put the movies in order of when they were released.<br /><br />So, if you are a huge movie buff and pay attention to things like the names of background actors and who the directors were, you'll probably do a lot better at this game than we have.  Overall, very disappointing results from what I thought would be all about only comedy movies, which is my favorite genre. I give this one a &#34;meh&#34; rating.",

    "text": "I got this for my older kids who are huge POTC fans.<br />I've seen most of them, so knew that I wouldn't be as good as they were, but<br />we played this for several hours on New Year's Eve.<br /><br />First off, we have other Scene It games, and this board is too tiny to make the game<br />very much fun. I would highly suggest scanning the board (which is made of pirate coins<br />linked together to move towards the bullseye), and making your own longer version<br />of the board! It is truly very short! I want to expand the coins in the middle of the<br />game so it lasts a little longer. As is, it'll be great for kids with short attention spans.<br /><br />It seemed like the majority of the clips were from POTC #2. I really thought there would be<br />more variety than there really was. Many of the clips seemed to repeat, even though they asked<br />different questions about the same clip. I dunno - seemed almost like Disney threw this together<br />on a tight deadline and didn't have time to finish it!<br /><br />That being said, it is still a fun game to play, and I don't regret buying it (but I got it on sale).<br />The price most retailers charge is way too high for what you'll get, so just be aware of that.<br />I would have felt very ripped off if I paid full price. For some reason, the POTC franchise has decided<br />they are worth a small fortune, and that their fans will pay any price for any item. (For example, I'd like the POTC<br />Yahtzee, but not at the prices they are charging! They need to be more realistic of the value of their games.)<br /><br />So, if you have POTC fans at your house, they'll definitely enjoy the game. Just know that it'll end pretty darned<br />quickly as is, so you might need to create your own board to make it more fun.",

    "text": "I had almost forgotten about this little loom -- I first learned how to make these potholders in the 1950s even before I started school (I was probably 5 yrs old).  My brother and I spent many summers working on these and selling them around the neighborhood to augment our $0.25/week allowance.  My mother taught us how to make them and kept us supplied with the loops while we came up with our own designs.<br /><br />One thing I remember very clearly -- she avoided nylon loops, preferring instead cotton loops.  Why?  Because the nylon loops could melt at the temperatures commonly encountered when using cast iron pans and metal baking dishes in hot ovens.  I retained that memory, so when I saw this kit available with cotton loops, I knew I needed to try it one more time.<br /><br />The major difference I see is in the length of the \"prongs\" in the loom -- I recall them being a little longer.  Also, the metal weaving hook was a bit longer.  But other than that, the design and construction are close to what I used as a child.<br /><br />The package from Amazon arrived earlier today, and I quickly put together the potholder in the photo.  It took probably an hour -- perhaps a bit longer, but not much.  There are enough loops for a couple of pot holders and enough colors to mix and match.  Follow the directions, especially the part about finishing -- pulling one of the loops on each finished edge back over a loom peg to keep the rest of the loops on the adjacent and opposite sides from popping off the loom.  Take your time with this part -- it's easy to want to hurry to finish it, but it can be a bit \"fiddly.\"<br /><br />Very happy with this -- I've already ordered additional loops in specific colors to coordinate with my kitchen colors so I can make several of these to use as potholders as well as hot pads/trivets.",

I've made holiday ornaments, snowflakes, greeting cards, picture frames, etc.  So I'm already reasonably familiar with the concept.  I was curious to see how Alex Toys had \"automated\" the process to make it easier for a younger generation to discover this versatile craft.<br /><br />You get everything you need to make the projects shown on the box:  the battery-operated \"winder,\" the paper strips, the glue, the bases, the cards, the quilling board, the tweezers -- everything EXCEPT the batteries (you'll need to supply those yourself).<br /><br />The instructions are relatively clear.  Younger children (the toy is recommended for age 8+) will probably need some adult help to get started, but older kids should be fine.  Feeding the paper strips is just a bit fiddly at first -- it took me a couple of tries to get everything to work properly, but after that, it was smooth sailing.  The kit includes clear instructions for making the various shapes (teardrop, petal, scroll, etc.) needed to complete the projects.<br /><br />This might be a good intro to quilling for creative youngsters who want to try something a little different.

When I want a spattered background, I color onto a glass surface, then wet a paintbrush to pick up some of the color and \"flick\" it onto the card surface.  I've also used these with stencils on card fronts -- color onto glass, then use a wet make-up sponge to pick up the color, then blot it onto the card front through the stencil.  Overlap a few shades, and it makes an interesting variegated background.<br /><br />These are VERY reminiscent of Faber-Castell Gelatos, but in an easier-to-use form -- a thinner stick with a twist-up core.

I chose to hang mine on the wall of my guest bathroom because the colors work with a couple of other art pieces I have there.<br /><br />I would not recommend this for any child under 11 or 12 yrs old, and even then, you'll need to firmly glue the frame together and and most likely help with unrolling the embroidery floss/thread so that it doesn't not.<br /><br />I struggled with the star rating for this.

I find it a great way to relax, and there are some amazing &#34;coloring books for adults&#34; gaining popularity these days (Johanna Basford, Angie Grace, etc.).  And there are whole communities of &#34;colorists&#34; popping up on social media.<br /><br />So naturally, I'm looking for different mediums to use when I color.  I've used colored pencils and gel pens, so I figured it was time to branch out into the marker arena.  Someone suggested starting with these as they're water-based rather than alcohol-based, and Amazon has them at a good price, so I got the 50-ct set.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased.  There is a good selection of colors, several shades of each, which helps to bring some variety into th mix.<br /><br />What I DON'T like (and this seems to be a problem for ALL coloring mediums): the actual color of the pen/pencil/etc. almost NEVER matches the color of the cap/barrel/etc.  I realize that colors will look different depending on the type a &#34;color&#34; of paper used as the background, but seriously, some of these are WAY off.  I find myself having to make a &#34;cheat sheet&#34; on the paper I'm using just so I can get a clear picture of how the various colors REALLY look.<br /><br />Like I said, this isn't just a problem with Crayola, but they make it a little more difficult because the pens have NO distinguishing markings on them whatsoever to designate a color number or code.  I ended up putting little pieces of masking tape on each pen and numbering them myself just so I can keep the color charts coordinated.<br /><br />All that aside, they work great once you figure out the colors.  Colors are vibrant, and I had very little &#34;bleed through&#34; or feathering in an Angie Grace book.  Bleed through and feathering depend a great deal on the paper used, so bear that in mind and ALWAYS test before coloring.<br /><br />Overall​, I like these - don't &#34;love&#34; them, but they're good quality water-based markers at a very good price.",

    "text": "The Beados concept is interesting: small beads that get \"sticky\" when wet.  Place them in a little segmented tray in a design or pattern, spritz with water, let dry, and you have a little art piece.  This product, the \"Quick Dry Design Station\" provides a little boost for the drying process -- a fan -- that is intended to shorten the time needed for your creation to dry.  Sounds good, right?  Welllllll ... yeah, sort of.<br /><br />First, the recommended age for this is \"4+.\"  Yeah, not really.  I'd say 7 or 8 -- the beads are small, and require some fairly well-developed fine motor skills to get them arranged.<br /><br />Then there are the \"tweezers.\"  These don't really work all that well.  I understand why they're included -- if fingers are the least bit wet, the beads will stick, so this should help with keeping beads dry.  But they just don't work that well.  Definitely need a redesign.  I noticed that some other Beados sets include a \"pen\" that places a bead at a time, and that might work better.  Whatever -- this set comes with tweezers, and they just don't work.<br /><br />The templates that come with the set are OK -- butterfly, various animals, etc.  Kinda takes the creativity out of the equation, though.  Still, it's a good way to learn how to work the various components, following a template.  After that, a child may be able to create their own designs, which leads to .... the beads issue.<br /><br />The beads are small, and even though there are 500 of them, you'll find that it really isn't a lot.  You will DEFINITELY want to get more of the beads, and they're not cheap.  Do NOT get them wet -- don't let water get anywhere near them -- or you'll have a real mess.<br /><br />The fan is just a fan -- it's battery powered, and even with the exposed blade, it's not powerful enough to do much damage to little fingers.  It puts out a slight breeze that will help the design dry a little faster.  Instructions say 15 minutes.  Don't believe it.  Allow a MINIMUM of 30 minutes.  You may have to play with the amount of water needed to make the design stick together -- too much, and it takes for ever to dry; too little, and it doesn't stick.  Definitely don't \"soak\" them.  I found that about 6-7 \"spritzes\" from the included sprayer works OK.<br /><br />The resulting bead \"plaques\" aren't very sturdy -- gentle play would be OK, but they really are fragile.<br /><br />Bottom line: I'm just not sure how much \"fun\" this will be for an artistic child.  With the technical issues (tweezers, etc.), it may be more frustrating than enjoyable.  And you WILL need to invest more to get more beads.  If your child wants to play with creating designs, and approaches it more from an artistic angle rather than a \"let's make some toys!\" angle, it might be a good choice.",

    "text": "I tested this with my iPad.  The box contains the info you need to obtain the app from the App Store, and installing the app on the iPad is no problem.<br /><br />You use the \"stamper\" tool to activate the app, which unlocks all the features and pictures available for the Paint Pack.  There are NO instructions except those that pertain to the tools; nothing about the various available stencils, patterns, etc.  This might be a problem, as it's not intuitively obvious what those \"dimmed\" images are (they're stencils), or how to use them (paint or draw on top of them, then \"remove\" the stencil).  You do get a nice variety of pictures, and the various functions are well integrated:  you can stamp on a picture, start with a blank \"canvas\" and add whatever stencils, stamps, or freehand drawing you want, etc.  Creating your own custom colors is also not difficult.  That's the good news.<br /><br />Now for the not-so-good news, and the primary reasons for my 3-star review:<br /><br />Within 10 minutes, the paintbrush tool was splayed and virtually useless.  It's nothing more than a stylus with a bunch of plastic \"bristles,\" and in order to get the tip close enough to the screen to register, the bristles end up bent and splayed.  You lose what little precision you started with, which wasn't much.  No way to see the lines of the pictures if you're coloring, no way to see what you're doing.<br /><br />The \"air brush\" works OK, as does the stamp - the instructions are accurate, and you have some degree of control with these.<br /><br />Then I decided to try the capacitive stylus that I use all the time with my iPad.  It worked perfectly.  I could \"paint,\" \"airbrush\" and even \"stamp\" with the stylus.  EVERY function worked with the stylus.  Yes, I know the \"airbrush\" has two rubber \"feet\" and the instructions say both must be touching the screen in order for the airbrush to work -- the airbrush will work just fine with a single stylus in contact with the screen.  Same with the stamp (which has 3 rubber \"feet\") -- just touch the provided stamp image from the collection on the left side of the screen, and then touch the screen with the stylus, and you'll get the stamped image on your drawing.  What's more, my stylus has a slim tip, and I have far greater control and precision with it than I had with any of the Crayola tools.<br /><br />My advice? Activate the software with the stamper, then switch to a stylus for everything else.  I'm afraid that kids would be terribly frustrated with the tools included in this set.  Which begs the question: is this worth the price just for the downloadable app and activation \"stamp\"?<br /><br />Bottom line: not terribly impressed; just OK.",

By careful coloring (I use Prismacolor pencils), this \"beachy\" scene can easily become a winter scene.  I paired it with this little snowman stamp [[ASIN:B008VQ21RA Inkadinkado Wood Stamp, Snowman]] -- stamped and colored him separately, then fussy-cut him out and mounted him slightly to the right of the lighthouse using dimensional foam tabs so he looks like he's in the foreground.

    "text": "Love this! Been using one of those green felt sheets and knew there had to be something better. Read one of the other reviews, and he/she must not have read the instructions. If you use the covers for the extra boards, the pieces won't move; and if you use the extra large felt piece to place on the main board when you pack it away, the same is true - no pieces move around. I find this a very useful contraption when you have cats. The pieces will also slide easily when pushed in place, but stay placed when board is at a slant. Would recommend for any puzzle fan!!! Was a  lot more sturdy than I thought it would be. Very impressed!!!<br /><br />Update: LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! One of the best purchases I have ever made! Have now put together four more puzzles since I bought it. No complaints what so ever. I've put together one \"shaped\" puzzle which would not fit, but all I had to do was put together pieces, and used the extra four panels, and it worked out great. I would not want a larger board, because for me, anything bigger would be too hard to hold in my lap. I use this on my chaise lounge chair while I watch TV. (I'm a multi-tasker.) I love being able to put it all away at the end of the day, and it only takes a few minutes.<br /><br />GREAT PURCHASE! IF YOU LOVE JIGSAW PUZZLES, YOU WILL LOVE THIS!",

Questionable as to the replay value though as I haven't seen my daughter play with it again even though she still has some blank dolls and foil left. (Already used templates cannot be used again).

I bought two, one for my two and four year old.<br /><br />Pros: I love that everything fits inside the kit so it can be easily stored.<br /><br />I like the way markers are displayed. It reminds them to put the lids on and keeps us from losing them.<br /><br />Theoretically would work well for travel. No mess and all pieces are fairly secured onto the kit.<br /><br />Cons: the kit could be deeper to accommodate more storage. We have additional markers and color wonder coloring books (which you will need since you only get a few sheets with this set) and you can't really fit too much more than what comes with the set inside the case.<br /><br />The stamp. UGH. Again, I wanted to love it, but even when I tried to get the stamp to work I could barely do it. The kids could never get more than 1/2 of the stamp at best making it impossible to see the animal or use it as a stencil to color in.<br /><br />Why wouldn't the paper clip onto the kit? Everything else is well suited for travel, but the paper just falls off when they're in the car and then there's a meltdown.<br /><br />Overall it's fine. Good for travel I suppose, but as a primary art kit, leaves much to be desired.",

Due to this we have hardly made it through a match, since if you put the pieces in the wrong place, you have taken the computer right out of the game in its ability to generate moves that make sense in relation to the game pieces.  Another thing that throws off the board computer is that the white/black pieces must be set up as they are on the picture in the manual, BUT it in no way ever tells you this.  My husband discovered this fact, when the computer was having him Castle his Queen (which would have been the King if it was set up right - but there was no way to know, since it wasn't in the instructions).  Otherwise it is what it claims to be, and my 6 yr old learned quickly how to follow the lights for the suggested moves of pieces on the labeled grid board.",

Unfortunately, this toy was not the quality product we hoped it would be.<br /><br />First, it is very important that you carefully check the device list on the official website.  These toys DO NOT WORK on the vast majority of tablets and phones.  Unfortunately, they did not work on my son's tablet, an Acer Icona.  We checked the product list and it listed the Samsung Galaxy 3, which I happen to have, so I downloaded the game to my phone so my son could play with his new toy.<br /><br />Second, the toys are extremely difficult to teleport into the game.  It takes several minutes of manipulating the direction you are holding the lens, the lighting in the room to get the toys to teleport into the game.  It was impossible for my 5 year old to do it on his own, so we had to spend several minutes teleporting each character into the game.<br /><br />The worst part is once you close the game, the characters you teleported in are deleted from the game, so if you want to use them again, you have to go through the process in the second paragraph all over again.<br /><br />This additional toy added nothing but frustration to an otherwise fun game.",

Other than that, it's a fun game but lack of an outer box really irks me. In addition, it took 10 days to get here and I was a prime member at the time. I have no idea what the hold up was but I guess 10 days is still ok.<br /><br />It's the lack of the outer box that irks me",

It's much louder than every other toy we have When they have the volume turned all the way up/at the highest level.<br /><br />There is a switch on the bottom to turn it off/on. Unfortunately, this switch does absolutely nothing (as you can see in the posted video). This is very frustrating when I'm trying to clean up and it starts blasting music and sounds. It has woken him up on multiple occasions. We took the batteries out for a while, but then it loses its appeal and he never plays with it.<br /><br />Maybe we just got a dud. There is an on/off switch, so we may have just received one that's defective. If it worked, I would probably rate it 3 stars. Baby enjoys it, but  due to the high volume and no option to turn it down, I can't justify a higher rating.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:6c81671ef35e0e0aafb707b8d54a0bf4]] My mom bought this for my little one recently. The doll itself is cute and soft, but that's the only good thing about it. Upon first years we discovered that the sound is completely off. Look at the video I uploaded to see what I mean. We tried changing the batteries twice, but that's not the problem. She bought it while I was still pregnant so at this point it's too late to return. For the price this definitely is not worth it there's so many other cute peekaboo stuffed animals that actually do work. Maybe I just got a lemon but I wouldn't waste my money on it if I were you. The bandanna doesn't even cover his eyes when he lifts it up. Really cute concept but it just didn't pan out.",

    "text": "I bought this puzzle through iseeme.com. Our daughters Elf on the Shelf left it for her one day last week. She was thrilled, but it was somewhat daunting for her. She's 7, and this was her first puzzle over 50 pieces. We put it together as a family over the course of 3 evenings (1-2hours each night). I was surprised at how much she enjoyed it and stayed involved from beginning to end. I'm going to frame it and it will become a part of our Christmas decor. Definitely a great puzzle- it looks great, and the way it's sectioned made it easier to put together.",

    "text": "I honestly cannot say enough how much I love this game. Best $6 or $7 I've spent in a long time. It was a last minute &#34;why not&#34; purchase as a Christmas present for my 4 year old daughter. She wasn't exactly thrilled when she opened it. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles kids nowadays are accustomed to. After one game, this became our new family favorite. I've been struggling to help her learn the letters of the alphabet before she starts preschool in the fall. I've tried a lot of ways (mainly from Pinterest which typically is a lifesaver) but she would get bored with it after 10-15 minutes. I think because she sees this as a game (which it is) instead of something she &#34;has&#34; to do, she loves it and a month later we still play a few times a day. At its core it's your basic bingo game. Everything is paper. The large letter board seems like regular weight paper, and the bingo cards, letters, and red dots are a heavier weight card stock. Our letter board has a few minor rips in it and has had water spilled on it at least once, but it still serves its purpose. If you are able to, I would recommend laminating everything (especially if using it in a classroom setting).<br /><br />My daughter is really catching on and can now independently recognize every letter of the alphabet! In the beginning when she only recognized about half of the letters, we had her start at A and point to each letter while saying/singing her ABCs until she got to the letter on the card. I thought she would be over it by the second game, but surprisingly she loved it! I'm so glad I bought this game, it has truly increased her confidence and has her eager to learn again! Would buy this again in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "My husband bought this for our 4 year old daughters Rapunzel theme birthday party in mid August 2016. He purchased it at Walmart and I have no idea how much he spent so I cannot comment on the price comparison, but at the time of writing this review it is $14 on Amazon and I think that's a fair price. My daughter was so excited about this doll, and I must agree that the idea of it is awesome. She was so eager to &#34;paint&#34; Rapunzels dress. The white part of her dress will change when you rub the &#34;paint brush&#34; over it. You fill the brush with water and there's a small sponge type thing at the top of it that you use to paint the dress. I was initially concerned that this was going to end in a big mess, but I'm happy to say I was wrong. It's almost 100% mess free. When there's water and children you've got to expect a little clean up afterward, but honestly it's not even enough to warrant wiping up with a paper towel... It's a fairly simple concept and our daughter is able to do everything (including filling the brush and securing the stopper so it doesn't leak) which is a win for both of us. She's at that age where independence is big, and she feels so proud and confident when she can independently play with something that Mom or Dad had to help her with in the past.<br />In the 4+ months she has had this doll I'd guess it's been &#34;painted&#34; 20-30 times and it still returns to white after it has dried. I saw a review where the dress stayed &#34;painted&#34; after 3 uses, and I'm guessing that they got a bad/defected one. Maybe it got soaking wet and that caused it. Idk, I can only tell you what our experience has been. Ours has never been fully saturated with water. There are a few small scratches on the white part where you can see the colors, but I'd expect that. I don't know of any toy that a 4 year old plays with often that doesn't have a few scratches and other minor damage to it. Overall it has held up and works better than I initially expected. Any toy that combines dolls and water play will likely be a hit (at least with the kids)!  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. She likes it so much that Santa recently brought her the Cinderella one and we are just as happy with that one as well.",

    "text": "My almost 4 year old is just starting to take an interest in Barbies. I'm so mad I didn't keep all of mine from my childhood, I could be saving a bundle!  She really doesn't care what Barbie she gets, she just loves to use her imagination and play with dolls. We had a small birthday party for her at my Grandparents house since they cannot travel to come to her main birthday party.  We bought her a Power Wheels for her birthday, so I didn't want to spend a lot but needed something to give her at her &#34;other&#34; party. I am so glad I went with this!  Her and her 2 cousins (7 year old girl and 3 year old boy) had so much fun playing with this set.  When I was taking it out of the box and talking to my daughter about the dog shaking the water off my Mom kept saying there's no way that dog is going to move. We were all pleasantly surprised when I pushed down on the dog colar. I LOVE that there are no batteries, no winding it up, just push down and watch the dogs tail spin in circles and head go back and forth. I read several reviews that love the dog, but were dissappointed in the barbie.  I knew going in that her arms don't move from their position, so I wasn't thrown off by that feature, and I honestly don't think it's a big deal AT ALL. The kids didn't seem to mind one bit. The thing is, there are a million different barbies, that do a million different things. This Barbie is the designated dog washer in Barbie Land, lol. Her arms don't need to move for her to serve her purpose... Of course anything with water is going to hold a childs attention just a little bit longer than usual. The three kids sat on the bathroom floor for over an hour taking turns washing the dog!  Their favorite feature is the soap bottle. I will say that is the only thing that may become annoying to a parent over time. It's appropriately sized for the playset, but we found ourselves refilling that bottle about every 4-5 minutes while they played with it. If you have an older child who could fill it themselves with water and a drop or two of soap, then you have nothing to worry about. The soap bottle is actually a really ingenius feature. I filled it with water and added about a quarter pump of hand soap, put the cap back on and shook it up before giving it back to the kids. If you hold it upside down (cap side down) water comes out the holes, but if you hold it right side up (or sideways) and squeeze you'll only have bubbles coming out so you can &#34;wash&#34; the dog. This is hands down her favorite Barbie in her collection! Such a simple concept, yet it's provided hours of fun every day for the past week.",

    "text": "This guy is fantastic! As an avid figure collector i know good quality from lousy one, but this figure surpassed all my expectations. He's big, sturdy and made with utmost attention to details even his box is wonderful! He looks very nice and so cool and posing him is easy, he's quite flexible but I wouldn't be too rough with any action figure type figure. For people who don't like his base and want another one there are a few options first you can use a bamboo coaster which I'm using for my play arts kai ff13 figures or you can buy an unfinished wooden base from michaels and paint it yourself or you can buy a fully finished base from E2046 they have a wide selection of nice bases but their shipping is kind of high, to secure him on his base try using double sided sticky squares which are used to mount wall posters, works very well and don't harm the paint and easy to cut to size. Hope this help! I highly recommend this figure it's amazing!",

So much attention to details specially in his face, his brand looks nice, his cloth are soft and flexible and his joints are strong and he's very flexible. This a collector figure and not a kids toy so bear in mind that fact before buying they may be sturdy and well made but they still can't endure kids rough play, they are specifically made for adult collectors and display in dynamic poses. Personally i like this figure, he definitely got lots of fine details and a great deal of craftsmanship, i like the character from the game i decided to buy the figure and this is the first play arts figure i own and I'm certainly not disappointed with the quality. I'm a figure collector but all my figures are complete non action figures, snow is the first action figure i own and he well deserves a spot on a display shelf next to any other cool figure. Buy it I certainly recommend it.",

It has three lights options, and it goes so fast, the remote is easy to handle and the battery was included which was a very good surprise to me. Came fast in the mail and that was another good surprise. I bought a velocity toy rc car before this one and it doesn't compare in quality, this one definitely wins. Overall it was a good purchase and i will be buying more maisto rc cars in the future.",
