These are best kept in a cabinet and not rolled; here is where it gets dicey, pun intended. After playing several D&D games, we very QUICKLY discovered how poorly they roll. So much so, that we had to take notes and get stats on probability. Referencing the d20 here, all 4 sets consistently rolled under 8, 87% of the time. Our parties were wiping quickly and early on, and the entire experience sucked because nobody could successfully perform a d20 roll for anything. We rolled these hundreds and hundreds of times and collected the data. We could not ignore the results. We are not sure if this batch was unbalanced, or something went wrong, but they are completely unusable. We'll either toss them in the trash or shelve them indefinitely. It's really too bad, they are beautiful dice.",

I like the overall quality of them they are a hollow die set so they aren't too heavy even though they're metal. I will say that the the gems that are in the eyes aren't super apparent even when you hold it up to light. If I hadn't read that they were there I wouldn't of thought they existed to be honest. This is a pack of just six sided die there are no other shapes in this set so it has somewhat limited use for a character unless you were using it as a DM or a specific character need. Might be cool for other games though.<br /><br />These are decently balanced and feel nice in the hand. They aren't too heavy and are easy to roll, after rolling several rounds they were consistently inconsistent and numbers so I'm happy and confident that they aren't weighted oddly.",

    "text": "Overall this is a decent pet play set. My 2.5 year old has been obsessed with doll houses and figures so this seemed like a good choice for her as she loves animals. It is marked 3+, so we took out the very small accessories for now.<br /><br />There are two pieces that need to be assembled: the swing and the slide. There are no directions but they are a snap to get together. The slide has three parts: the blue slide and the right and left halves of the ladder. I recommend putting the prongs from the blue slide into one side of the ladder and then clicking the other half of the ladder in place, lining up the steps as you go.<br /><br />The swing has six parts: the seat, the “rope” on each side, the top (where the hooks are), and both sides of the stand. Because the other pieces were prong and hold style I kept looking for something like that but the top pink piece with the hooks clicks right into the bluish side pieces. The “ropes click into the seat and then slide into the hooks.<br /><br />The quality on this set is decent. There are a lot of accessories with different functions so you can tailor the play accordingly and use the same basic set for different stories. There are basic “house” style furniture, pet bed, dog house, food bowl, etc. then there are also veterinarian tools like a syringe, stethoscope, and random pink box with a cross on it. There are also pet grooming accessories like brushes, scissors, blow dryer, shampoos, sprays, etc. then there are pet shop style display boxes and a pet carrier.<br /><br />There is a nice mix of cats and dogs with basic plastic colors (white, gray, off white/tan). The paint job on the faces leaves something to be desired. The eyes are either crooked or missing completely. I plan to take my mini paint brushes and touch them up a bit before giving this to my daughter.<br /><br />The plastic feels a little thin compared to other similar name brand sets and the stickers are askew on a few pieces. It also came with a lot of cardboard inserts to use in the display (all the same image) which I am never a fan of in kids toys. If you leave it, it will get wrecked. It also is a wasteful use of cardboard. The set is not improved by their presence and we just throw it in the recycling.",

This is a decently constructed anatomical model, though I have a few things that I didn't love about it.<br /><br />1.) construction. Part of it is assembled but the skull cap, legs, and stand aren't. The skull cap does not sit or attach correctly and leaves a decent gap on one side if you push it down on the other side. The tabs don't fit well into the holes.<br /><br />2.) the joints. The joints on this aren't ball joints where they should be. It's not THAT big of a deal but it would have been nice to have had ball joints for appropriate range of motion.<br /><br />3.) quality/manufacturing. There are sharp pokey bits all around this thing where they were not sanded or trimmed right in the manufacturing process. Easy to fix (just sand it down) but a hassle. The plastic is a little thin so I don't know how long this will hold up.<br /><br />I do like the spring jaw mechanic, it wasn't expected so it is a nice piece. It also comes with a nice poster labeling the bones and anatomy of the skeletal system.<br /><br />This would be a great prop for medical use or in a classroom.",

At the lowest setting it doesn't really push the bubbles out enough. As a result you end up with a pile of bubbles underneath the machine.",

In my opinion this smells better than others I've worked with and even better than the ones I make myself.<br /><br />It does still have that classic glue smell but it isn't as strong as I expected.<br /><br />The glitter in this is so fine that you cannot feel it. I've had other slimes in the past that feel chunky or even pokey due to big glitter pieces. This is smooth and satisfying.<br /><br />I do find that this formula will “snap” if pulled too hard and can sort of “shatter” with little pieces getting all over if pulled too fast/hard.

They do a decent job but you have to be within 12-14 feet to accurately hit anyone. This isn't a problem for us because it's just really casual and we just keep running closer to each other to play but if someone has issues with this it could cause hurt feelings/arguments.<br /><br />These are great for the backyard at night and flash brightly when you get hit.

This is a high quality set complete with pots and pans, a little cutting board, and a great assortment of Velcro foods.<br /><br />I love Velcro foods with the “cutting board” because it is a great way to work on fine motor life skills (ADLs) and gives kids a chance to interact with play foods in a variety of ways. I am over the moon for this set both as a play therapist and owner of a pediatric therapy clinic but as a mom to a 16 month old who adores play food.<br /><br />One thing I will mention here is that you should go through and take each piece apart to make sure the Velcro is thoroughly attached. On the crab, carrot, and cabbage the Velcro did not stick to the correct side. By placing it back over the side and pressing down, I was able to sort it out and it seems to be holding up fine now. Just wanted to put that out there in case anyone else had this issue.",

This kit is a two for one as it has everything I look for in both! Great value for the money and incredibly high quality.<br /><br />There is so much thoughtfulness in this set. The blood pressure cuff is Velcro (just like a real one) and the part you pump up has a squeaky ball in it. There are interactive components to so much of this which elevates pretend play.<br /><br />I love that it comes with a little bag to keep everything together. My only complaint is the flosser. I wish that it was a little thinner so it would fit between the play teeth to better demonstrate proper oral hygiene. It is currently too thick and won't move between the teeth.",

She didn't express a real interest in using it until 9 weeks old but she will bring it to her mouth and grasp it with both hands now (10 weeks)<br /><br />Pros: happy with the price, the size, it is lightweight and easy to move around, nice looking design<br /><br />Con: not a very loud rattle. You need to shake vigorously in order to get any sound. This may not be stimulating enough for some babies and the motion needed may prove startling to some.<br /><br />My advice: practice showing your baby this rattle each day for a couple of minutes and help them by gently placing it in an open palm, once they have a little grip on it, move the rattle gently to show them they can create the noise. This may take a little while but keep at it! They will get there eventually! If your baby is more of a sensory seeker, this rattle might not cut it sound-wise.",

    "title": "DIY Ball Pit and Sensory Pool",
    "text": "Why use a pool as Ball Pit?<br /><br />In short: Ball Pits are a great therapy tool! The visual, auditory and tactile sensory stimuli and the proprioceptive feedback builds confidence and strengthens motor skills during occupational therapy. Using balls of multiple colors can help with visual sensory stimulus and they can be used to build early speech skills like color identification, counting and more. If properly padded and filled with crush-resistant balls, they can be great for deep pressure and vestibular activities (kids love to throw themselves into a sea of colors).<br /><br />Using an inflatable pool means that you don't need this to be out all of time, it is soft and provides a decent cushion on the sides (we put a thick therapy pad under ours to protect kids who like to dive in). It is also easy to clean the pool and the balls all at once. Plus this can be used as a ball pit, put a duvet full of pillows and its a crash pad, fill it with water or sand, foam, goop, etc. There are loads of options to use this for.<br /><br />Activities and games can also be created based on the child's age and goals. For example, one game we play a lot is a sort of tiny basketball. A therapist can ask the child to find a red ball and then a blue ball and shoot them into a hoop. Doing this works on color identification (as I mentioned before), receptive language, multi-step directions, and the fine motor skills of finding and grasping the ball, motor planning to throw the ball into the hoop, and so on.<br /><br />To sum it up: They are fun, great for sensory and body awareness therapies, and I had this deep personal bias that it would just be so gosh darn fun to have one, even if just a temporary one to pull out as needed.<br /><br />It cost us $37.99 and measures in at 90x 58 inches, which was a perfect size for the space beside one of our climbing towers/rope tree and the wall. If it ever gets a hole in it or gets damaged (which one has), I am not heartbroken, after all, it cost less than $40 and is easily replaced.<br /><br />We blow ours up with the tiny electric air pump that we use on all of our inflatable therapy tools (peanuts and yoga and therapy balls). It is the same kind used for camping/air mattresses and works like a charm  It is tough to blow up without this, so I definitely recommend picking one up if you don't have one!<br /><br />There is a cap in the bottom that allows you to fill it up with water and then simply open the bottom valve piece to drain it later. We use this for balls, water, and sand play but you could fill it with foam or goop for another sensory-fun option.<br /><br />I am still rating this as 5 stars though we have had to buy two. The first one we bought ripped along an inner seam (due to some of our rowdier kiddos) and was not fixable due to the location. Mind you, this was after month and months of constant daily abuse by multiple kids from age 3 to 12 all jumping off of, diving into, thrashing around, and generally having a good time with it.",

Hands down, one of the best investments we've ever made are these ball pit balls.<br /><br />Why a Ball Pit?<br /><br />In short: Ball Pits are a great therapy tool! The visual, auditory and tactile sensory stimuli and the proprioceptive feedback builds confidence and strengthens motor skills during occupational therapy. Using balls of multiple colors can help with visual sensory stimulus and they can be used to build early speech skills like color identification, counting and more. If properly padded and filled with crush-resistant balls (like these), they can be great for deep pressure and vestibular activities (kids love to throw themselves into a sea of colors).<br /><br />Activities and games can also be created based on the child's age and goals. For example, one game we play a lot is a sort of tiny basketball. A therapist can ask the child to find a red ball and then a blue ball and shoot them into a hoop. Doing this works on color identification (as I mentioned before), receptive language, multi-step directions, and the fine motor skills of finding and grasping the ball, motor planning to throw the ball into the hoop, and so on.<br /><br />To sum it up: They are fun, great for sensory and body awareness therapies, and I had this deep personal bias that it would just be so gosh darn fun to have one (who doesn't love a ball pit!), even if just a temporary one to pull out as needed. We decided to try out and fill an inflatable pool so we could use it as a ball pit OR as a sand/water play sensory pool as we wanted.<br /><br />We bought the 1,000 pack you see above and an additional 400 (same provider) to fill our 90\" X 58\" pit up just enough to where we felt it would be fun, though to be honest, I could absolutely buy another 400+ at some point just to really amp up the fun of diving into them.<br /><br />I really like these ones because they are BPA and Phthalate free and they are crush proof, which has held up true so far for us and we've been using these for about 4 months daily with several kiddos who play rough.<br /><br />These have been thrown, squeezed, stepped on, jumped on, dived into, you name it.<br /><br />They clean easily with disinfectant wipes and spray and the pool makes it even easier to sanitize; simply fill up, wash, drain, rinse, repeat.<br /><br />They may be a little bit smaller than some other brands but I personally prefer these and wouldn't buy any others around as the bigger ones can be too hard to children working on fine and gross motor skills to grip and throw.",

My daughters had a similar one when they were little in the early 2000's. The refill bottle in Target costs 20.00. Let me teach you a cheaper way. Go to dollar tree and buy 5 bottles of baby shampoo. Pour all 5 in bottom of container. Fill the tub up about1/4 full. Mix around with your hand. You will have good smelling, tear proof foam. Way cheaper and better than the original. I buy about 10 bottles of shampoo so that the kids can have a couple hours of play. We shut it off in between so as to cause the bubbles to last. As they die down turn it back on. DO NOT leave the pump plugged in though it will continue to spill out the top. You must unplug the soap pump it does not have an on/off switch. Unplug it first then turn off the machine.

It comes, assembled, with a helpful little instruction sheet showing how to take it apart and put it together again, if you want to cheat (or practice for a challenge.) When assembled, it fits together tightly enough that it won't come apart if your dog's tail knocks it off on the floor. It takes some effort to loosen the pieces.

    "text": "This little marker airbrush is a lot of fun. At first, I was confused by the ingenious marker storage device. I put the markers in the slots, but they wouldn't snap up into place beside the air compressor unit. They just flopped down. Then, I realized I hadn't pressed the compressor unit down hard enough into the base section. You really have to push down hard until you feel and hear the central unit snap into place. Now, the little markers nest up next to the compressor when I'm ready to store them and flare out when I want to play.<br />The compressor itself runs on four C cells, which are not included. When you buy this gadget, pick up the batteries or you will be ready to play while it just sits there. Don't you just hate that? Okay, so now you have the batteries. You also need a Phillips head screwdriver to open the battery compartment on the bottom of the compressor unit. The good news is, the positive and negative poles are marked and once you get the battery compartment closed you're not going to lose the battery compartment cover. If you getting this for a child, expect to spend some time assembling it. It's not as bad as a bike or a playhouse, but some assembly--and batteries--are required.<br />Spray painting with the provided marker-like sticks is a lot of fun. You put a stick in the wide end of the spray gizmo attached to the compressor, place a stencil (many are provided) on a sheet of black paper (also provided) and spray away. The compressor is very quiet. The ink, at first, does not seem very intense, but it gets brighter as it dries. There are several projects included, but I think it's more fun to use their elements to make my own designs. I like the KaBoom airbrush very much. If you like it too, you might want to pick up some extra marker sticks.",

He started crawling, and loved to \"walk\" around holding on to our fingers, so I quickly assembled the walker (super easy, just 2 screws to put in place to attach handle).  He soon started pulling up, and loved (still loves) this walker.  Occasionally he tried to get to it from the front and it falls over, but he is learning to only pull up using the back handle. My boy is not too heavy, so he doesn't have any problems with it being too light and falling over, although babies who are just learning to pull up may need a parent to hold down the front so it doesn't topple over. My son learned quickly, and now rarely has it fall over. I love that you can adjust the tension on the wheels so it doesn't fly across the room. I would certainly recommend this to a friend, and would buy it again in a heartbeat. It is very sturdy construction, and all the wooden block to play with are just a great added bonus in my mind....as my son hasn't even really been interested in them yet.",

We also used glitter and other things and really personalized the ceramic pieces, otherwise, they would have been pretty plain.<br />However, the real star of this is the remote-controlled unicorn and that is what my daughter really loves and it's great. She has and uses it every day and it's going strong even after months of being played with. She is very happy with it and therefore I am very happy with it.",

Also, love that these aren't folded or creased so they always unfold perfectly, and with the clips I can have them flattened out within seconds and ready to play on. The dice and markers were an added bonus that I wasn't expecting. These maps are laminated so the dry erase markers are awesome to include so that things can be drawn on the different terrains and then quickly erased without problems. The dice are cool too, especially since I am a dice hoarder and love a good set of dice. Overall this set is amazing and I could not be happier with this set.

I do with the paint job could have been a bit better, especially on the eye, making it a different color or something to make it stand out more, but overall it's a great looking trunk. It doesn't come with a lock, like I was thinking it would, which is fine but would have been fun for it to come with the lock shown in the pictures. Also, the latch is made of very thin metal and as long as you take care of the box I think it will last a while.

I have had a few of these in the past and none of them have ever been even close to as good as this one nor did they ever come with the stuff that came with this kit. The fact that it comes with a half a pound of stones makes this kit great but add in the polishing stuff and then the actual quality of the tumbler and you have one of the best kits on the market.<br /><br />The tumbler itself is made out of heavy steal so it stays where you put it and doesn't slide or move around like other tumblers would do. The barrel itself is perfect being made out of heavy rubber with a lid that fits tightly so nothing comes out and everything stays securely inside the barrel. Another great part about this kit is the fact that the barrel being made out of heavy rubber it makes it more insulated which makes it much quieter to use than other tumblers. Because I can tell you that other tumblers were loud and because it took days to polish the rocks that it was not a fun or quiet hobby to do in your house. However, with this kit it is so much quieter that you can have it set up in a spare room or even the dining room and you won't hear it all through the house.<br /><br />This is a wonderful tumbler set for any age and because I make jewelry it helps cut down on a lot of the cost when it comes to buying pre-polished stones. Now I can do it myself and it's so much more cost effective and my bottom line loves that. Great set that I will continue to use for years to come.",

It's also much easier to control too as the plastic comes out. It isn't spotty in some areas and goes together so much more smoother and just better. It's also easier having the plastic go into the back of the pen instead of the top side because it doesn't get wrapped into everything. This pen is just great and I love using it.

You don't get anything in this kit that you can't find in your kitchen to do the same experiments. What makes it even worse, it is marketed towards young girls, and I would bet if it were marketed for boys it would have way cooler experiments than baking soda and vinegar powder. Seriously, do they not think that girls want things to explode and make a mess too. I know I do and so did my cousin who was trying this out with me. It was super disappointing and we did better stuff with the things I had in my kitchen than I did with the lousy powders you get in this kit. I am very happy that they have science kits that are marketed towards girls and trying to get girls more interested in science but give us some awesome experiments and not these unimpressive so called &#34;experiments&#34;.<br /><br />Also, I can see that you can buy other kits to go with this one and hopefully those will make up for these lame experiments. So, if you buy this kit at least buy one of the expansion kits so that your kid isn't too disappointed. Either do that, or look online and check out some really cool experiments you can do from things you have right in your kitchen.

It has a very nice sturdy tripod that comes with it and it's easy to put on the telescope. Everything fits together perfectly and you can get this telescope put together and star gazing in no time.<br /><br />I am super impressed with how well it works. I have used it outside looking at the moon and stars and I have also used it inside looking through a window. I have to say, that both places worked very well and I had no problems seeing through the telescope. I loved how well I could see the moon and yes, even the surface and craters. I could also see loads up stars up close and it was just magical, to say the least.<br /><br />I've not bothered with any of the activity books but from what I could tell they are pretty good and would be great for kids to learn more about the stars and galaxy. The meteorite that comes in this is pretty cool and I am a sucker for anything to do with space so it's something cool to have.<br /><br />If my review has helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking below!",

I had already placed a pre-order for this same Ken Doll directly from Mattel. I decided that I liked this model of Ken so much, that I wanted to have a second that I could feel free to open and re-dress for display. I am an adult collector, but find that this Ken would be completely appropriate for play. I do not advise to alter his hairstyle as the plugs are thick and do not look attractive if it's untied.<br /><br />In fact, I find this doll would be much better for children than the terrible budget ones available in most local big-box stores as this doll is completely articulated. Most of the budget dolls are not great for play because they cannot move their elbows and often even legs to use a chair! This doll can use a doll-sized cell phone, hold a doll-sized drink and be posed in many different ways. He is a great doll for practicing photography skills. In fact, I like to use these dolls with good articulation to do a series of photos that I call 'photo-stories'. I do not draw very well, so I like to use articulated dolls as models to tell short little stories that I later share with other adult doll collectors.

    "title": "Many Accessories Included; Many Potentially Frustrating Issues",
    "text": "I am overall satisfied with my order of the Simba Steffi Love Camper Set. This arrived very well packaged for shipping. It was not overly difficult to remove from the box as most of the securing straps simply untied. There were several pieces of clear tape that needed to be removed. I do like that this set included a Steffi Love doll. It's an overall nice doll with articulated ankles and knees. I do wish that the elbows were also articulated, but they are not. She has shoes, a simple dress and sunglasses. She has underpants imprinted on her plastic pelvis. I do not advise to remove the elastic on her hair as the plugged hair will show the widely spaced hair plugs and be less than attractive.<br /><br />The first impression of the playset inside the packaging is that it's very cute and attractive. The camper itself is not as durable as I had hoped. This will not stand up to rough play. I would not at all advise this to be accessible to toddlers or careless children because if one tried to use it as a seat or step-stool, it would break easily. The wheels are held in place with a metal rod, this would be a safety hazard if it came out of place. The many small accessories are also not appropriate for very small children as they could pose a choking hazard. There is not enough leg room in the two front seats for the doll's legs, they must be bent to the side or the doll has to sit sideways. Not all of the doors are well-molded to close completely. Some stickers are included, which is nice as one side of the camper already is decorated with stickers, leaving the opposite side blank. Several packets of accessories are included so the dolls can use props for various activities such as cooking, lounging and even showering. The small accessories are the best point of this playset.<br /><br />I personally do not find this camper set to be a good value at it's current price point. There are too many issues that will lead to frustration in play. Primarily, the type of plastic material used to mold the camper is prone to failure as it's not at all durable. The play patterns of most small children will prove to be the source of frustration or failure of the toy. This type of plastic is prone to shattering and can produce sharp edges if broken. For many children, this will be a short-lived disposable toy. This would be most ideal for children that play gently and are able to keep small toys well organized and enjoy playing with fashion dolls. The camper itself measures about 22\" long, 11\" wide and 9 1/2\" tall. This will need a significant amount of storage space, and would not easily withstand being stored stacked with other toys in a toybox. This would be best 'parked' under a bed, in a closet or on a shelf between play sessions to avoid a tripping hazard. I hope that my experience with this camper set is helpful as you kindly click the button below.",

    "text": "I am very pleased with my order of the New Model Realistic Newborn Babies Doll. The doll arrived in excellent condition and was well packaged. She has a magnetic pacifier, extra onesie, a certificate and bottle included with her. I was very surprised to find out she is scented and smells like a freshly washed baby. She's very cute, sits easily on her own and has been assembled well. This is a nice alternative from a customized reborn kit from an artist. The hair has been punched, and does not look too bad. It's sparse, but as the doll is suppose to represent a baby, I find this is fine by me. Her limbs are soft, but there is stuffing inside them. The body is fabric, and stuffed well. The limbs can move, but there is no inner armature making her very cuddly. There is nothing to add weight, so she is light.<br /><br />I really like her and am adding her to my personal doll collection. I have customized reborn kits myself before, and find that she doesn't look any worse or better than the ones I have done. I find that she would be a good gift for most kids that can be mindful with their toys. I hope you find my experience helpful as you kindly click the button below.",

We enjoyed going at different times of the day to see what types of shells washed onto the shore and collected ones we liked. The bags were great for this. I really appreciated the adjustable straps. As the fabric is mesh, this allowed the bags to hang on the balcony and let the shells dry after being collected so we can take them home easily. Sand and other small debris washed away with a quick rinse. I considered the larger bag a bonus, it would be fine to use for beach toys, but we found it very useful to transport wet bathing suits to the laundry area, as I did not think to bring a laundry bag. I used the little pouch on the larger bag to hold the detergent pods until we got to a machine. I saw similar bags available at the gift shops, and in comparison, these are much better quality and a much better price. The bags would be useful for a variety of adventures, including foraging for berries, collecting beans in the garden or finding special rocks.

The quality is debatable. The plastic castings are overall nice of all 10 pieces, only one didn't want to sit upright flat due to some over-spill of the plastic on the grape drink can. The colors are accurate to the products they are to represent and the chia seed drinks even look like there have tiny seeds suspended inside.

    "text": "I've been customizing doll house kits for several years now, since 2008. I'm really pleased the hobby has grown and that nice pieces like the Meirucorp Dollhouse 1/12 SCALE Miniature Wood Furniture is available on Amazon. This is very nice and perfectly to scale. The blue is a color that I remember being very, very popular through out the 80s and 90s and I feel is due for a comeback. The little wooden coffee table is perfect in every way as well. I don't see any glue likes or obvious flaws, which is great as that is common with commercially made dollhouse furniture. Since it's in scale, made well and fashionable for many dollhouses, I have to say this is a really good value. I was skeptical that this might look junky, but it's actually really nice! I'm very pleasantly surprised! I hope that you have found my experience in this review helpful and kindly will click the button below!",

    "text": "We were really surprised at the amount of accessories included in the Hello Kitty and Friends So-Delish Kitchen Playset. My little one really likes Hello Kitty, so this is a great addition to the collection, but it doesn't take up a lot of space to store between play sessions. It can be part of a diorama kids make to play with their toys and is also in a scale similar to Barbie and other comparable fashion dolls. The colors are very vibrant. The doll looks very nice, but the play is limited as she does not have articulated elbows or knees. If the doll was articulated like other dolls in the similar price range, this would be a 5-star item. The outfit is easy to remove so the doll can have costume changes. Overall, it's a fair value for the amount of accessories and detailed painting. This may also be very appealing to adult collectors. It's a nice playset that would be a big hit for kids or adults that are kids at heart whom are fans of Hello Kitty. Thank you for reading my review.

It's double layered and the clear layer has an adorable print. The doll and Hello Kitty are painted very well, no flaws. The package is not constructed very well for collectors, as the back ground is also the back panel for the box, and can be dented very easily during shipping. I would be most likely to recommend this doll for kids or for collectors that do not display dolls inside the box. A couple things that would be an improvement would be a doll with articulated knees and elbows for more poses during play. The outfit wold also be more attractive if the hems were finished and not left as overcasting. However, this is often the style of many modern play dolls. Overall, the styling of the set is very true to Sanrio and the doll's quality is on par with current dolls from Mattel. Thanks for reading my review.

I've always been able to get the finest, sharpest point from this brand of pencils. I'm a big fan of their watercolor pencils as well. This kit is the same level of quality I've come to expect from the maker. I'd recommend this to anyone that wishes to have a nice set of drawing pencils, and would make a great small gift!

    "text": "BUDDY N BUDDIES Magic Shoes Toy doesn't provide much for play value. Several pieces are needed to make a total of 5 right shoes. Not pairs, just the right... which isn't a lot of fun after they are assembled. They don't fit any sort of popular doll, nor would they fit children. Once they are assembled, there's nothing to do with them other than take them apart and re-assemble. Some creativity is involved, and many, many small parts that are difficult for small hands to remove. It also makes some sharp points, so I don't feel comfortable recommending this toy to children. The sharp points left from removing the decorations to place in the pegs are dangerous, the very small parts can be lost easily, and may pose a choking hazard to small children or pets. It is recommend for children 3 and up, as it states on the package, but they are so small they can be easily lost. I find this shoe playset to be a poor value because once they are assembled, there is no re-play value. Very few children would find this appealing and it was a disappointing toy in my household. If the shoes came in pairs, fit popular dolls and the smaller pieces removed without sharp edges, this would be a good idea. As it is, it's just not a good value for the money, or time.

The set is in a metal tin with some wells in the lid, which can serve as a palette, it folds out on two hinges. A color chart is included along with a small pad of water color paper, a small brush and two pen brushes. The pen brushes will open to fill by turning the opposite direction than you may expect. I like to use distilled water with my watercolors, and strongly suggest everyone do this. It will keep fine in the refillable brush pens without allowing for microbial growth.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this color palette because the colors are more natural, but still very vibrant. I found the colors to be very transparent, even yellow, which can pose an issue in similar sets. Blooming and blending were easy to achieve, allowing for a variety of effects. The binding agents are fair to good, as the pans were a little difficult to wet initally but soon took to the water very well.<br /><br />This is a great set to gift as it includes brush pens, a brush and paper with the paint pans. This allows you to only add water to get started. I would not recommend this set for small children, and this is stated on the package. It contains small parts that may pose a choking hazard. This is a great budget set, a fair value and would be excellent for hobbyists and budding artists. I would not recommend it for professional artists, or upper-level students for course work, as this set is not designed for these users.

Her feet are flat, she can stand on a flat surface if positioned just right. Her joints are at 5 points, neck, arms and legs. She can sit, but tends to fall back as her head makes her very top-heavy. Her plastic coloring is milk chocolate. She is light weight and easy to hold but her plastic is very, very firm.<br /><br />I do wish she came with shoes, but she does not. She does not come with any other accessories. Her box is easy to open and worth keeping. The inside is a coloring sheet of a house.

I have no idea what sort of lifestyle this doll was leading before being delivered to my home, but she has her shoes and all of her small accessories scattered in her hair. She has need for some help to get back on the right track. The box encourages the player to remove her accessories to fix her hair, give her face a scrub with the plastic bubble mask and to get her dressed. However, the messy face is also a mask, so it's as if the doll actually has 2 masks. Her hair is typical of most play dolls. It's a little stiff for packaging, but with a quick rinse it's soft. The plugs are fairly even, but not perfect. Once she's assembled, she's really cute and her style theme is adapted from Shinjuku that originates from Japan.<br /><br />This line is appealing to kids because the doll is articulated, which is often overlooked in most modern lines of fashion dolls. This means she can pose and use a variety of accessories like vehicles or other toys that most kids already have in their toy collections.  Kawaii.Qtee is a really cute doll, since she can pose, she has the potential for more versatile play than the mannequin lines of dolls that focus solely on appearance. For the versatility of play, I highly recommend this doll for most children over the age of 6. She would make an excellent gift.",

It's beautiful except for one thing that I'll pick on very hard because it's distracting. All of the metal embellishments are antiqued brass except for the button that fastens the strap, it's antiqued silver. I do not like this at all, because it simply doesn't match an otherwise beautiful case. The company logo could also stand to be a little smaller, in my humble opinion, as it's distracting. Besides those two design features, I really like the style. It helps set the mood at the table as well as providing a secure holder for your cards.

    "text": "This is a great kit with easy instructions. You may need another measuring spoon and a small bowl for mixing, but other than that, everything is inside the kit! This is so nice because some things can be used over again, like the molds and containers. I really liked that the recipe is broken down to 4 1/4 teaspoons total of dry ingredients at a time. This is better than a full recipe for adult crafting so kids can focus on one or two molds at a time, and not be overwhelmed. Items like baking soda, citric acid and epsom salt are all easily available in most regions, so this is something that can be replenished easily.<br /><br />I feel this is a great gift for kids because they do get to see what happens and it's such a small recipe, they can do it themselves, as long as they can read. Smaller kids can do this too, with help. You can also avoid some of the supplies like glitter, colorant or the trinkets if you like, and make a more plain bath bomb. It's a lot of fun and I have no regrets ordering it.",

    "title": "Not a BJD, No Neck, Not as Described, Deeply Disappointed",
    "text": "I absolutely love dolls of all types and own hundreds of them. They range from inexpensive off-brand play dolls, legitimate BJDs, to high-end handmade artist dolls. This is likely the worst designed doll I have ever handled.<br /><br />This doll has a very cute face and poses well. However, the deal-breaker is that she has No Neck! Her head sits right on her shoulders. This is very distracting because it makes it hard to look at her. I would be able to overlook so many of the other negative aspects to this doll if she had a neck like the doll in the description photos. This is very disappointing. It's such a pity as she has a very pretty face.<br /><br />This is not a BJD (ball-jointed doll). This doll shares a similar aesthetic to some BJDs, but she does not have even a single ball joint. She has hinge and swivel joints only. The doll is made from at least three different types of plastic. One maybe ABS plastic, but there are no silicone components to this doll.<br /><br />Her hair is pretty rooted plugs. The description led me to believe it may be a wig, but no.  The plugs are evenly spaced and I do not see any bald spots. The hair fibers are soft. The eyelashes are glued strips and the eyes are inset acrylics. She has very pretty face that is painted symmetrically. The joints were very, very stiff and difficult to loosen with force. Once loosened, she does pose decently and can touch her face. She has a full outfit that is made with flawed fabric. Several threads are missing in the weave of the fabric of the skirt. The flawed fabric is very noticeable. The outfit has a shirt, vest, skirt, bloomers, knee socks and a hat. It would be a very cute outfit if the stitching was a little more straight and the fabric was not deeply flawed fabric. The material is incredibly low quality. Her shoes are light purple canvas, do not match the outfit, but are fair quality and fit her flat feet snugly.<br /><br />A packet of 'accessories' are included and is confusing. They are thin plastic, various shades of pink and not to scale with the doll. The comb and 4 little hair elastics may be useful to play with the doll but otherwise they would likely not be much fun for playing with the doll and I feel would be better left out of the package. Some heeled shoes were also included in the packet and although I could put them on the doll, the straps were useless and they looked odd as she has flat feet. Little fingers would likely become frustrated trying to fasten the straps.<br /><br />I looked into the UCanaan brand after ordering this doll. I was disappointed to learn that the company uses re-casted parts from legitimate BJD makers without permission. This is very sad/bad news. I would have expected better from a US retail site and find it deeply disappointing. I do not know that any pieces are made from the re-casted parts from other companies for this particular doll, but it's a serious negative point that should be noted. I cannot say with confidence this is not a re-casted doll. I would not be surprised to learn that it is.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this doll. The primary reasons being she has no neck, is not as described and the company does shady business practices. This makes me very uneasy as it sets up customers for some serious disappointment. If you are looking for a budget-friendly legitimate BJD, there are other companies that make very nice lower-cost dolls. It takes a minimum amount of looking off the site to find them. If you are looking for a nice doll for display, or posing and play, please note this one has no neck and uses poor quality materials. Your money would be better spent elsewhere. I do not find this to be a good value in the least. She would be enjoyable for display if she had a neck like the doll in the description photos. I hope that this can be remedied in the future. I find this doll very disappointing and it's such a pity as she would otherwise be very cute with an alternative outfit.<br /><br />I do hope you have found my honest review helpful.

The TITANSHIELD Dice Tray solves this problem. In addition, Titan Shield also makes a really beautiful solid metal dice set (pictured but not included), which is sure to mar many table surfaces. The Dice Tray coordinates really well with the metal dice set, and it folds flat! The magnetic snaps are a nice touch. Sometimes I have a little trouble with my hands when they get tired, so this is easy for me to use. I'm sure there are other table top gamers that deal with arthritis of the hands, so this would be great for them. Folding flat to fit into the bag of gear is especially nice, and I appreciate that a lot. It also comes in it's own resealable bag, which is much thicker than the one you would use around the house. It keeps my Dice Tray nice and clean between sessions.<br /><br />The stitching is solid and the materials appear to be good quality. I believe the TITANSHIELD Dice Tray should easily last me at least a few decades of play. It would also make a really nice, affordable gift for the table top gamer in your life.<br /><br />Thanks so much for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",

    "text": "Kids generally like anything that's dough, slime or 'sand'. It's not really sand, but the table-top type of magical sand. It's been trendy among the toy market for several years now. Instead of just a few toys to do a beach role-play or tiny sand castles, this one is more of a 'make-anything' kit. The set-up is very easy. Most kids ages 6+ will not need any help with the kit. They can set it up themselves. There are several little bags and packets inside, so that's the real mess to clean up. The 'sand' itself is relatively clean. It sticks together well. The 'sand' is in three small packets that are a handful each in the hand of a 6 year-old. Yellow, teal and pink colorant is included along with 3 very small packets of glitter. I like that the glitter is an option. In our house, we do not allow glitter, so the fact that this can be removed was very nice for us. The colors are vibrant and pretty, but they enjoyed the sand before deciding to mix. Younger kids may be confused as they see a ball of purple sand on the package, so we had a quick color-wheel lesson to make the purple sand.<br /><br />Overall, this was a pleasant product. This would make a nice gift, the box would be very easy to wrap in paper. It's not very messy and makes for an exciting table-top activity. No stains, no need to change clothes, minimal clean-up. The only thing that I wish was an option was a little more volume of sand. However, we have located some re-fill packs. It would be a nice add-on if being gifted. I will include the link below for those that have interest.<br /><br />Sand refill:<br />https://www.amazon.com/Canal-Toys-USA-Ltd-Satisfying/dp/B082DXV1V8/ref=sr_1_13?dchild=1&keywords=So+DIY&qid=1596526757&sr=8-13<br /><br />Thank you so much for reading my review.

    "text": "I was a bit crestfallen upon arrival of the Spellbook Cards Holder. It was packaged well, but has apparently had some contact with a moist environment sometime between manufacture and arrival. The leather cord has corroded a metal brad at the spine holding the plastic sleeves in place along with the metal dragon clasp. The leather cord is also much, much too short to pull taut when the Spellbook is full of cards. The leather cover has permanent denting from the tautness simply from holding the included blank cards during shipping. I will be replacing the leather cording myself, and live with the damage.<br /><br />Damages aside, this is a beautiful Tome of Recollection. It is genuine leather, that is double mounted onto a canvas at the back and two thin leather pieces are joined together canvas side to canvas side. It has 60 sleeves, which should be sufficient for most tabletop players to transport their collection of spells for a single session. I would not suggest trying to stuff more than one card per sleeve, or else risk the plastic sleeves splitting.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very cool style and the price point makes for a very affordable gift for yourself or any card-welding tabletop player in your life. I do hope my experience is a bit of a fluke, but most vendors can offer a remedy in the event of an unsatisfactory purchase.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

These really are the most beautiful dice I have ever seen and photos really do not do them justice.<br /><br />The dice are slightly smaller than my other standard sized, acrylic polyhedral dice sets. They roll well, but I'm sticking to a dice box or tower to avoid denting surfaces. I think the dice themselves can likely withstand denting, as they are solid metal.<br /><br />These would be great for a wealthy and/or greedy character. The only real downside is that though most of the dice have a smooth edge, the 4-sided dice is awfully sharp. This could do some damage if squeezed too tightly, carried unprotected in a pocket or stepped upon. So, use some caution.<br /><br />These are really pretty and would make a nice gift for any table top gamer in your life or for yourself.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

Do you want your favorite wrestler to take on any and all opponents and launch them across the room on a gurney? The possibilities for action are endless with the WWE Wrekkin' Slambulance from Mattel.<br /><br />WWE figures easily fit inside the Slambulance, both in the two seats in the cab, on the stretcher and through the top of the vehicle. Little ones will have a great time with the breakaway parts that include all four doors, the lights, the windshield, the multiple side panels, the hood and the top. There are even cool details under the hood! Launch an opponent from the back by pressing the front license plate!<br /><br />Mattel does a great job designing toys for rough play.  It's priced appropriately for the high-quality I've come to expect from Mattel, and makes a good value for the hours of play it will endure. The WWE Wrekkin' Slambulance will be a huge hit for any children age 6 and up that are not prone to putting random objects and toys into their mouth. Mattel's toys are built well, but with enough effort, parts of the Slambulance could be broken into small parts and pose a safety threat to very young children, those with some types of disabilities or pets. Decal stickers are included with some instructions and the standard safety warnings.<br /><br />The WWE Wrekkin' Slambulance has been getting hours of play. It should last for a long life. Adult collectors may also appreciate the addition of the WWE Wrekkin' Slambulance to their collection. The vehicle is a larger toy, as it can transport many different figures. We tested WWE Wrekkin The Rock Action Figure and Roman Reigns from series 108 (see links below). Both the figures fit well in the cab seats and strapped onto the included gurney easily. Both can be posed to hold onto the breakaway pieces and make use of the pegs on the back of the Slambulance to hang on for a ride around the house.<br /><br />WWE Wrekkin' Slambulance will make a great gift. Amazon sent the vehicle inside the Mattel shipper box, so it would be easy to wrap that way. The display packaging is a bit odd shaped, so an outer box would make wrapping much easier.<br /><br />WWE Wrekkin The Rock Action Figure<br />https://www.amazon.com/WWE-Wrekkin-6-inch-Wreckable-Accessory/dp/B07Y92JHWN/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+rock+wrekkin&qid=1596266699&s=toys-and-games&sr=1-1<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/WWE-Roman-Reigns-Figura-acci%C3%B3n/dp/B07Y93GMXD/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=roman+reigns&qid=1596266517&s=toys-and-games&sr=1-5<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

    "text": "As it's true for Mimics, Conjurer Co Mimic Chest Dice Storage Box is a hefty little chest. It weighs 1 pound 8.9 ounces (706 grams). It measures 5 1/5 inches across (14cm), 3 1/2 inches (9cm) deep and 4 inches (10cm) at it's height. The sculpting is sturdy. It consists of two solid resin pieces that are attached with 2 very sturdy hinges. The hinges are sturdy enough to support the heft of the lid while it is displayed completely open. It does not tip, nor attempt to close once opened completely. The front features a clasp that has a loop for a lock. All hardware pieces are sturdy, and attached to the Mimic with small screws. As in the description, a lock is not included. I found one that appears to be compatible and coordinating here on Amazon, which I will be ordering. See the link below if you have interest. I will attempt to edit the review to let you all know the results upon arrival of the lock.<br /><br />The Conjurer Co Mimic Chest Dice Storage Box is styled and sculpted to be true to Mimic D&D monster lore. The interior bottom really does resemble the obnoxious monster, instead of simply being a storage box. I count this as a plus, as nearly anyone can simply paint a plain trinket box and call it a Mimic. I am especially impressed with the interior sculpting, it's terrifying, especially the sculpted eye inside and 21 teeth inside the top lid. The interior bottom of the Mimic has 25 teeth and sculpted gross Mimic guts. Scary stuff for sure! The exterior painting is quite nice. It does not scratch away easily. I'm happy with the company's paint job, but with it being resin, it could be removed and repainted by anyone wishing to do their own customization or paint job. Conjurer Co. By Merhoff & Larkin is proudly stamped into the resin of the bottom exterior. Each box will have some slight variations, as this is clearly a hand-crafted, hand-painted piece. Personally, I'm a fan of handmade items, and find this box as a very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />I found The Conjurer Co Mimic Chest Dice Storage Box has exceeded my expectations. I did my own comparison with many other artistic interpretations of a Mimic along with alternative storage boxes. This does the job of easily storing 3 sets of common sized acrylic dice along with serving as a horrifying prop during play. I'm excited to bring The Conjurer Co Mimic Chest Dice Storage Box to the table, it's an impressive hand-crafted prop. Between games, it will make a nice display piece with some other D&D props and figures on a shelf. It's a good value, especially once I made some comparisons between The Conjurer Co Mimic Chest Dice Storage Box, other dice storage boxes and different types of hand-crafted Mimic props.<br /><br />The Conjurer Co Mimic Chest Dice Storage Box is an ideal, unique gift for any table-top role play enthusiast, figure collector or your beloved local Dungeon Master. It would also serve as a nice gift for yourself. It comes packaged in a small, white cardboard box with an interior lined with 1/2 inch Styrofoam. It would be easy to wrap in paper to present as a gift.<br /><br />Here is a link to the lock I will be ordering for The Conjurer Co Mimic Chest Dice Storage Box.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D9GKDXW/ref=ewc_pr_img_2?smid=A3677OU9D16YFH&psc=1<br />Here is another link for a set of 3 similar locks.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074XVJQCQ/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A3AT0NGXDFCYMG&psc=1",

There are currently 14 different Animoodles Magnetic Stuffed Animal Plush toys. Most popular animals among today's current toy trends are available. The plush material is incredibly soft and the embroidered features are incredibly cute. We were able to have Kylie the Cat join our household. Her limbs were each held into place with a plastic tab, which was not difficult to clip and remove completely.<br /><br />Kylie came with a booklet that tells the origin story of the Animoodles with small written profiles and photos of each toy in the series. There are also practical safety warnings regarding the magnets used in the plush.<br /><br />I had some concerns about magnets in a child's toy, but the smallest magnet I can feel through the fabric is about the size of a nickle. The stitching is solid, it would be difficult to remove the magnets. Kylie has a lemon bow stitched onto her head, the colors are very cohesive. The pupil of the eyes are buttons. I would strongly advise this toy to not be available to any child under 3 or any other children that are prone to putting random objects into their mouth or being overly destructive with their toys. The button eyes and internal magnets are simply not safe for babies, toddlers or destructive children, as it's made clear in the attached booklet.<br /><br />The Animoodles Magnetic Stuffed Animal Plush would make a great gift for many children. However, Kylie was in a sealed plastic bag inside the shipping box, so this may be a gift that is better to present in a gift bag rather than wrapping unless you opt to use the shipping box. Play would be expanded with more Animoodles from the series. Additional Animoodles allow for any sort of crazy plush hybrid desired.<br /><br />My favorite features of the Animoodles is the creative construction and the softness of the plush material. This would make a great addition to any plush animal collection.",

    "text": "Hairdorables Loves - Hello Kitty is a very sweet looking little doll. She's a smaller doll, so would look very child-like compared to play scale fashion dolls. You can see the doll clearly inside the packaging. It's a nice shape, so easy to wrap and gift. However, there are some missed opportunities for play due to the packaging. When a child is gifted a doll, their main focus is on the doll itself. The box features the doll on half the front, behind a clear plastic viewing window and 'Surprises Inside' on the left with 4 small pop-out tabs to retrieve little plastic packets containing the doll's accessories. In order to remove the doll from the box, the entire inner diorama background comes out, to expose the packets, leaving the fun of the pop-out tabs wasted. If the 'Surprises Inside' part was not attached to the doll's background, this would not be a problem. Instead, the focus of the packaging is on the little packets more than the doll itself. The background would almost make for a cute diorama to keep for play and/or display, but the integrity of that depends on the outer packaging. This could be easily remedied with a few alterations to the packaging, with less materials used.<br /><br />The great points of Hairdorables Loves - Hello Kitty are the Hello Kitty theme and color scheme used. They're all bright and really pop. She has Hello Kitty on the bodice of her dress, with fuzzy short sleeves and an attached skirt with the cutest, tiny little bows. The skirt of the dress would be much cuter if it was about 1cm longer. It is removable, so similar sized dolls can swap clothes. The accessories are scaled appropriately to use with the doll. Shoes fit easily and the saddle stand pops together with minimal effort. I really loved the fact that a stand was included, this will help the hairstyle remain intact for kids that choose to do so. She has a hairband with a bow molded into place, and a bow-shaped barrette for her hair. I like the bubble pigtails and the 4 different colors in her hair. Her purse is a solid piece and fits easily onto either of her arms. She has limited posing. Limbs swing front to back and her head only turns side to side. 4 sheets of stickers are included, one in each accessory packet. Neither the doll nor the packaging has any designated area for the stickers, so children are likely to put them anywhere. There is also a little cardboard piece in one of the packets with the title of the doll's release and a drawing reflecting the style of the doll from the outer package. I'm not sure what it is for, but it's there.<br /><br />Over all the doll is really cute, the colors are wonderful and the theme is fun. The missed opportunities for more play from a little closet and/or diorama for the doll is a pity. It would be easy to wrap and present as a gift, but beware that the current trend of surprise packets supersedes the doll itself due to the packaging. I wish that the doll was removable without destroying the pop-out tabs and the main focus was more on the doll itself than the packaging.",

That's when I found this, so ordered to give a try. I was amazed by looking at number of things in this kit..so simple to use with just filling water in pen tubes...my kid loves it..and it came with rollers as well for border designs...a tray with sponge can be used with roller...it came with a nice bag so can pack it and take any where during travel...my kids spends daily an hour easily with this kit..savior for us during these remote work times with no school/daycares.. I strongly recommend this product i",

    "text": "Base Ten is the absolute BEST method for teaching beginning math concepts to children. I have my certification as an elementary school teacher and have been a substitute teacher in all grades for over 20 years. I've had first hand experience teaching beginning math to children. Place value is the hardest concept to teach young children, mostly because basic math is taught WRONG, in practically all schools. It starts with counting. Nearly all counting is taught starting with \"1\". 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10,  This is incorrect. Counting starts with ZERO...0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9. When you skip Zero and include Ten in the \"ones\" position, it completely messes with a child's concept of place valur. Ten is no longer a \"ten place value\" in the child's mind. It is a \"ones\" place value. Yet, when we begin teaching place value, we try to switch it and place it in the tens. This is very confusing to children. This Base Ten kit puts everything into the proper place and makes teaching counting and the concept of place value very easy.  When taught in this manner, children pick it up almost immediately. If your child is struggling with math, pick up this kit and re-teach them. It will make a world of difference. I highly recommend this.",

I would much prefer them doing something than watching something.<br /><br />It is nice because they can spend the time doing it and then they have something special to keep. They are excited when they make something themselves.<br /><br />This is a great activity for a rainy day or a day when your child is sick or when you are just stuck at home. It is a good way to keep a child busy.<br /><br />I thought it was age appropriate. It wasn't too hard. The children really liked how it turned out.<br /><br />I feel like this is good for child development. It kept my children's interest. It would also make a nice gift.<br />I would recommend it.",

My kids love balloons so they thought this was nice. The special balloons are neat.<br />This party kit was very nice. It is so nice to get all of these coordinating items. There is so much to it. It really looks good together. It is also a good value to get everything together instead of going to the party store and needing to buy everything individually. It is easier, more convenient and cheaper.<br /><br />We were pleased with the quality. It didn't take too long to set up. Everything went up okay. My kids liked it. I thought it was very cute and very festive. I would recommend it.",

They were well wrapped. My daughters were very excited to see them, and I think they would make a nice gift.<br /><br />The quality was good. They seem well made. They were a good size to bring with them and to hold. It is cute that they are a little different. I would recommend them.",

They really enjoyed it. It kept their interest. I really like that it gets them playing with others. It is great for them to play with each other or with us. We like to have family game nights.<br /><br />This game wasn't too hard for them to learn. The quality was very good. It held together fine. I really think it's a lot of fun for them. I also like to give games as gifts. I would recommend this one.",

They would be nice stocking stuffers.<br /><br />The quality was fine. I do wish they were a littlemore substantial and that the pictures were a little more detailed. This might be good for someone who is younger. It is nice to get the variety. It does have a nice selection. Overall I would recommend them.",
