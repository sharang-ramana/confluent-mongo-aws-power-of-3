    "text": "My 2 and 4 year old have been Color Wonder Mess Free fans for the past couple years. They love the Frozen designs and we have had no problems with markers drying out and absolutely zero mess. They of course love this, but I personally will continue to buy the coloring book plus 5 markers that come in a bag for typically $7-$8 dollars. This stow and go case is sturdy and decent quality (and would be convenient for an airplane or road trip!), but I think this product is pretty consumable and my kids will fly through the 24 coloring pages in a couple sittings, so there isn't much need for long term storage. There are included stickers that are meant to decorate the case, which is fun for my kids, but this is not a very attractive gift option in the plain blue case with no exterior packaging.<br />Overall we love Color Wonder and they are fun designs for anyone who loves Frozen. Personally I would prefer to pay half the price and get the Color Wonder Frozen set with 18 pages and 5 markers without a case and stickers.",

My 4 year old cannot play with it by herself either, and I even was occasionally having problems getting the wheels off, switching the cab back and forth between the dump truck and carrier, and extending the carrier's ramp up and down without feeling like I was going to break any of the plastic pieces. The carrier ramp is constantly falling off and the tops of the little cars don't stay securely attached either. If you tilt a little car at all, the plastic top will fall right off. (We haven't experienced the top falling off or the wheels being difficult to change on the full size Automoblox cars we have, just these minis.)  Overall my kids still enjoy this, and if I play with them the whole time, I can help switch things back and forth. But they cannot play independently with them and I wish it was designed differently because the concept is good.",

The concept is very simple but classic. There are two car fronts, two car backs, two sets of four wheels.... BUT, only one middle. This is where the toy falls short of perfect and creates problems when my 2 and 3 year old are both playing. The middle is the part with the holes that the rounded top of the car snaps in to. Our set came with a police top and a race car top, but only one can be used at a time since there is only one middle. Therefore one kid is left with only a front and back of a car with no middle or top. It seems like it would have been so easy to include a second middle, and that would have made a 5 star product. You can interchange all of the pieces and mix and match cars, but in the end you are limited to only having one full car.",

It's also amusing to read the poorly worded English on the box, but it is definitely clear that the seller wants you to be happy and they will refund or replace your toy within 12 months if it breaks for any reason. One thing to note is the cab on the semi doesn't turn by itself, it is all one piece that you have to push around and turn at the same time.

    "text": "My daughter will be 4 in a few months, and we had so much fun playing this game twice today! It took about 15 min to play each time. Each player takes turns flipping a card over and seeing if they can add the card to an existing ice cream cone on the table. Each ice cream cone needs a cone, at least one double scoop, and a top scoop with sprinkles, so 3 cards at minimum. But in order to add a card to a stack, you need to have two matching scoops that touch - only a mint chip scoop can be added on top of a mint chip scoop, or only a top scoop of strawberry with sprinkles can be placed on top of a strawberry scoop. If you draw a card that can't currently be matched to any existing cones, that card starts a new cone. When an ice cream cone is finished by having the cone, at least 1 double scoop, and the top, the player that finishes the cone gets to pick up all the cards and place them in their ice cream truck. When you have drawn all the cards in the deck and finished as many cones as possible, each player counts the cards in their truck to see who has the most. This is a great game because it is very cooperative, working together to try to make the cones. Also all of the pieces are laying out on the table so I can help my daughter make sure she's making a correct match. It was the perfect length for holding her interest, helps with matching/pattern skills, and at the end she counted to 24 to count all of her cards, so great practice there too. Overall the perfect game for my little ice cream lover.",

The other two pink/purple tops are a bit smaller, but probably wouldn't really fit my kids ideally until they were 5. I was able to use the butterfly wings to help hold the top in place on the 2 year old, and that did seem pretty effective. The set only comes with one set of wings and one wand, which isn't ideal for two kids to share, but ok. My biggest issue is the glitter. Tons and tons and tons of glitter falling off these.

First, card stock or thick paper seems ideal for not letting the color bleed through, but since I didn't have any on hand I had to stack 3 pieces of normal paper to keep the color off our table. Second, they take awhile to prime. Even a couple minutes of unuse will require you to hold the marker down extra long to get the ink back in the tip. Third, even after priming you cannot move quickly with these markers - you really need to patiently, slowly, and evenly push down each dot to get a full circle. Many of my daughters dots are incomplete and even when I tried I couldn't consistently get a complete dot. Also some colors seem to work better than others. Overall my daughter still likes them, but I cannot see her using them that often or being pleased with the results as she gets older.",

They were so excited that Thomas moved along the track by himself. My 3 year old has no problems pulling back the mechanism for Thomas to fly in to the tunnel, but my just turned 2 year old cannot do it himself. He has fun resetting the palm trees, switching the turbo track sections, and watching Thomas zoom around though. We have this set up on carpet, and after awhile it must have sunken it to the carpet a bit which caused Thomas to not land properly from the jump every few times and also get stuck going on the tracks under the jump. This would work best on hard floor or a very low pile carpet. I am also a bit concerned about the long term durability of the thin plastic pieces and the jump mechanism. Also this set only comes with one train, so keep that in mind if you have multiple kids wanting to have their own. This would be a great starter trackmaster set, and you can always add more tracks and trains to create longer loops. We are already dreaming up future designs ourselves!",

We got the 42 piece set back in the spring, and we have a Tegu monster and a whale, and this makes a great addition. Each block has a very nice feel, is smooth, and nicely painted in bright colors. The magnets are totally enclosed - no choking hazards here - and are very strong! It does take a while to get used to building with the magnets since the polar forces create a right side and a wrong side when you are trying to connect them. For that reason, although even my 1 year enjoys playing with them, kids will probably be best with these when they are 4 or older.<br />This expansion, with all of the columns, cubes and planks, is great for having the necessary pieces to stabilize most creations. (This set does NOT come with any angled pieces or wheels that come in the 42 piece set)<br />They are definitely pricey, but they really are top notch quality, and really all magnetic toys are on the expensive side. I feel the price is justified for such a well built, reinvented classic toy that will last for years.",

We have bought several larger sets prior to receiving this one, and even though they are pricey, the quality is great and magnetic toys are typically expensive. I feel the price is warranted. This set is fun, but it is very small so the opportunities of things to build are limited. If you are considering adding it to other blocks, I would recommend it. If you are looking for a travel set, I would instead recommend the pocket pouches that come in a carrying case since these don't have a case. And if you don't have any Tegu blocks at all, I'd recommend trying some because they're great, but you can do much more with the 14 piece set.",

It's the size of real tool boxes and definitely the nicest part of this product. And the tape measure is pretty cute. The tape pulls out like real tape measures and is 3 feet long. You hand wind it back up. The hammer, saw, and remaining pieces feel a smidge cheap, lightweight and not very durable. The colors are bright and attractive.

My 2.5 year old is good at putting them together and the 1 year old likes destroying the creations. To make anything specific like the house or car pictured on the bucket, you actually need to have some foresight in lining the pieces up-- certain sides have one row of prongs and the opposite sides have two rows, so there is actually a specific orientation that the blocks need to be in to line up many in a row or connect them in specific patterns. I would guess maybe a 4 or 5 year old may be able to do this themself? But for now my 2.5 year old just likes stacking them in towers and she really enjoys the flowers and animals too. 128 pieces gives you tons of options of things to do and build, and I think the price is very reasonable for a toy that will likely last forever. There aren't any pieces to break or deteriorate, the biggest thing you need to worry about is losing them or stepping on them!",

Next is a summary of the 3 letter apps:<br /><br />Bla Bla Box: spell out words and hear them read back to you<br />Alphamonster: choose a letter to hear the sound the letter makes and see a picture of a word beginning with that letter. See a picture of an item and identify what letter the item starts with. Hear a sound of a letter and identify the letter. See a cursive lowercase letter and identity the matching wooden uppercase letter. (In the settings you can pick which letters will appear throughout these challenges. The default is the entire alphabet but you can pick just a few if your child needs to focus on certain letters)<br />Vocabubble: game 1- pick any letter and as you repeatedly place the letter on the tablet, 8 different pictures of items beginning with that letter will fall down the screen. Game 2 - choose two letters, then pictures of items beginning with those two letters will fall down the screen and you tap the picture with the right letter in order for it to disappear. (This was a fun game my niece and nephew enjoyed playing together as they each held a letter. However, some pictures seemed too hard or random for a 5 year old, such as an Orca for the letter O... kids will think it's a Whale... or a Totem Pole or Quaill, etc)<br /><br />My five year old niece and nephew enjoyed testing these for me and were definitely interested in the games. I'm excited to start my daughter with it when she turns three and I can see the number apps extending the usefulness of the product as she gets older.

I think they are a little overpriced, but we still love them and will purchase more in the future.",

    "text": "When I got this, I still didn't solve the Rubik's cube. I know there are all kinds of tutorials, but I wanted to solve it on my own. Fast-forward 11 years later, I flipped the table (so to speak) and watched a couple tutorials. This was the cube I used to solve the puzzle for the first time. I watched a couple videos of the cube before receiving mine to get a better understanding of the mechanisms and design. During my first session, I set the magnets to the strongest and left the dials as they were. Two hours is how long it took me to solve it on the first try.<br /><br />I like that this cube comes with a handful of accessories. I use the case to carry the cube with me to and from work. It stays on my desk; whenever I have to read something on my monitors and not use the keyboard, I solve a little bit. Now I can solve the cube in minutes, though it took me a few days to get to this point. I now have the spring and tension set to the strongest for how much force can be pulled and weakest for how fast turns can be. (Apologies for not using the correct terms, but I tried looking up what the dials exactly do and I still can't figure out which does what with regard to the terminology, but I base it off feel.)<br /><br />The cube comes with a leather bag and a tool to adjust the magnets. The first time I accessed the dials, I used a pen to pop off the tiles. They can be difficult to pull off by hand alone, even after being pulled so many times. The lever for each dial also was difficult to pull. Now, I leave it semi-flush to the dial to make it easier to access in the future. They also pop off easily, but are [somewhat] easy to put back. The magnet levels sometimes move on their own. If I happen to notice a magnet at a strength I didn't set it at, I'll re-adjust. Annoying, but an easy fix. I no longer use the tool that came with the cube because any item small and flat enough will work. The bag is kept in the box for now.<br /><br />There are two manuals that come with the cube: one for the cube itself and the other on how to solve it. I tried using the solve tutorial but found it confusing with some typographical errors, so I used videos. I learn better visually anyway. Even though the cube's manual has great illustrations for the mechanics, I failed to understand what they actually do, so I looked up videos for that too.<br /><br />This is the third cube I own and currently it's my favorite. Each time my time lowers after solving, I adjust the settings. I'm becoming a speedcuber without realizing it.",

    "text": "The first TCG I was hooked on was Pokémon, which was about 10 years ago. I grew up with the Pokécraze in the 90s, and still collect the cards. Thankfully, I full unlimited sets of the first three sets. Over time, and of course with life's changes and demands, I stopped playing the game. Thank goodness, too, because what a money sink that can be. I played MtG for a bit, but thankfully convinced myself to stop playing because of the money factor alone. But I still love playing card games because of the physical cards and the resource management. Then I discovered Fantasy Flight's LCGs. I got into tabletop games from Europe before TCGs, so I was familiar with Fantasy Flight. I found out about their Lord of the Rings Card Game when it was first announced, but didn't bother to understand what an LCG was. With the pandemic, my interest in tabletop games peaked, but I still didn't want to get into TCGs. Then I was reminded of this game with the re-release and ordered the Core Set. What a wise choice.<br /><br />The rules are a beast to master, but they are clear and guide you with a comforting hand without feeling like they're holding your hand like it's a child's. If ever I was confused, all I had to do was look in another section of the manual and my confusion dissipated. To start, the game comes in that oh-so-ever-nice cardboard box Fantasy Flight games are known for. Upon opening, the game greets you with the rule book, an instruction guide, sheets of tokens and build-your-own life counters (Who doesn't live opening those fresh token sheets and popping them out?!) and a plastic insert with the sealed cards. What did I do next? Go to Board Game Geek and look up sweet printables the community made. Using the insert alone, I was able to organize the cards in a utilitarian manner. While the tokens and life counters provided are nice, I used third-party options that I'll explain later below.<br /><br />Finally, I sat down one night, blocked off two hours, and opened the instruction manual. The manual gives four starter decks to build. I built each played each against the first scenario. The first game took me the full two hours due to the learning curve. There's definitely a lot to keep track of. The game uses some mechanics from other TCGs, but does so in a way that makes it feel like I'm actually in a Middle-earth adventure. Almost like a choose-your-own adventure. Because the game can be played solo, I took my time to absorb every step and read each card's text in full. I know there can be only so much text on the small cards, but the font is *teeny*. The game certainly needs a well-lit table.<br /><br />After I tested each deck, I moved on to the next scenario, which helped me nearly memorize all the steps. To this day, I sometimes forget a step, so I made my own mini rule book that fits inside a deck box. (By the way, I use an Ultimate Guard Twin Flip'n'Tray, which comfortably holds two decks and the scenario deck--all double-sleeved--a handful of dividers, and two slim life counters.) Once I got to the third scenario, though, I hit a block. Another reason I steered clear from TCGs is the process of deck-building. It's long, tedious, and I just don't want to use what little time and memory I have to maintain decks. Thankfully, the years before the re-release have seen lots of contributions from the community. I recommend going to the game's Subreddit, which provides extremely useful and informative links on deck-building and steps for beginners. With Beorn's Path, I finally found fantastic decks to crush the third scenario--mostly. It's still a monster. Before the third scenario, I was hesitant on using more than one deck while playing solo. Keeping track of all those steps twice intimidated me, but I realized playing the third scenario with just one is impossible and only will cause you torment. Plus, there are mechanics that are available only with more than one deck. Once I confronted my fear, I soon realized how much more fun I was missing out on from using only one deck. The game does a wonderful job at incorporating other players.<br /><br />The game is fun, but can be frustrating. Some enemies are obscenely strong, and the rules (if followed strictly, which I do) can be unforgiving to follow. Playing a scenario for two hours or more only to lose makes for a frustrating experience. I thought finally beating the third scenario would be cathartic, but it was underwhelming. I won! ...Yay... The only prize was putting all those parts away.<br /><br />Now for the accessories. If a game has a good following on Board Game Geek, chances are the community will make fun accessories or suggestions of accessories to use. LotR: LCG utilizes turning the cards and tokens to show certain choices made throughout the game. This became a tedious process and quite messy; moving all those parts every step became a burden. Plus, the game needs a *lot* of table space. After consulting the internet and performing my own trials and errors, I've come to the setup in the picture attached to this review.<br /><br />- d20 for first-player token and round count<br />- Thin, plastic life counters that I can store in the deck box<br />- White and black stones for unperformed actions<br />- Small d6 for anything requiring numbers (life, quest progress, resource, etc.)<br />- d10 for heads/tails and randomizer<br />- Wooden card stand for staging area (optional, but helps)<br />- Large mouse pad for gaming area; I didn't like the large options game companies offer, and found that a large mouse pad met the size I needed and is very inexpensive compared to “official” options<br />- Deck box trays to hold player cards and unused tokens<br />- Beverage and edible optional, but strongly recommended<br /><br />This may seem to cause confusion, but this is what helps me keep track of every possible option in the game without getting lost or having to move a lot of cards/pieces compared to what's in the box. Yes, it adds more cost to the game, but it's completely optional. While this provides what I require for the Core Set, I will amend or append as necessary with each expansion.<br /><br />I finally found a card game I can play on my own and enjoy without having to pay big bucks.<br /><br />Note: If any of the review is confusing, please let me know. I never edit my reviews, but am more than happy to help.",

After that ban, I wanted to see the fuss. I didn't get into them right away because many of my classmates were learning more advanced tricks by the time I realized the hype, and I figured I'd never get to that level. But during one fateful summer, away from the city for the whole season, I practiced on my own. I learned a few tricks, but that was it.<br /><br />Fast-forward and I'm now seeing these toys more frequently downtown Chicago. From children to adults, the popularity is back. I did some research to see where I left off (quite a lot has happened), and looked up beginner-friendly yo-yos. I ordered this one and it's been played with daily since it arrived. It's very easy to use for someone like me who hasn't touched one in 20 years. There are different strings available, so no need to stress on back-ups just yet. There is also a bearing for an unresponsive mod, but I'm not there yet. So far, I've been able to re-do most of the tricks I learned, and I'm happy to see what else I'll learn with this one.",

This deck box holds all the decks and tokens wonderfully.<br /><br />The two player decks comprise about 100 cards, which I have double-sleeved using Dragon Shield Perfect Fit and Dragon Shield Matte sleeves. One player deck and half of the other fits completely in one card tray. The other card tray houses the other half of the second player deck, the encounter deck, the threat dials, a handful of Ultimate Guard card dividers, a Fisher Space pen and a few sheets of paper I use for various purposes. The token tray houses normal-sized d10 and d20, as well as a small dice bag filled with Chessex stones and 10mm dice. The petrol color is awesome and my favorite of the Twin Flip'n'Tray options.<br /><br />Though I keep the deck box at home, I imagine it will be sturdy on the move. I was worried about the magnets inadvertently loosening, but they are snappy and secure. The Professor knows what he's talking about. However, after watching some of The Professor's reviews on Gamegenic current offerings, I'm very intrigued. I don't have complaints with Ultimate Guard's non-removable flaps; I never even considered a company would make them removable.",

Even though there's only one button, the button combos do a lot. They can change the colors immediately, or have a rainbow cycle. I prefer the former as sometimes the rainbow cycle doesn't stop when I'd like. With the previous lightsaber, there weren't any fixed lights like there are here.<br /><br />Another thing I like is the uniform voice to indicate which sound font is being used. With the previous lightsaber, voices from films or shows were used, which sounded cheap to me. This lightsaber uses one male voice for all, but the sound fonts don't say the characters' names, only a theme surrounding them (but they're easy to tell whose is being used).<br /><br />While this lightsaber doesn't include music from the movies (my old one did), it's not something I miss.

As a much older person, I understood the mechanics but still had a challenge. It requires dexterity and speed; with two people doing the same thing, the game is bound to be fun and challenging for many.<br /><br />The box is a bit bigger than many game boxes, but no space is wasted. Everything is neatly packed, so there's zero airspace. That's great, but it also poses a problem if you have limited tabletop space. Because the box is tight, everything must be disassembled and placed in specific ways so the box stays closed. This is fine long-term, but if you want to pick this game up on a routine basis, and it isn't possible to just leave it on the table, then it's somewhat of a pain. That, coupled with the fact we have a cat; the basketballs remain exposed, and the cat loves to play.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm shocked at how budget-friendly this game is. It's certainly one of our favorite games to play with children in a wide age range (when we actually have the game out, that is).",

The last one I owned what a Force FX by Hasbro; my, how technology has evolved.<br /><br />This lightsaber is cheaper than the one I purchase, yet has a lot more to offer. While it doesn't have the \"expanding\" lights (it's sort of like a flashlight), the features it has make up for it. There's only one button, yet it does so much. Initial long press wakes it up or puts it to sleep. While it's on standby, there are button sequences that control music, volume, and sound font.<br /><br />With the light emitted, the lightsaber has clash functionality, and the ability to change colors. What I love about changing colors is that the colors cycle in a rainbow fashion; there is no predetermined number of colors. See a color you like between cycles? Stop on it and it stays. Pretty nice.<br /><br />The smooth swing works effectively, but the sound doesn't fade away; instead, there's an abrupt stop. So if you turn the lightsaber one way, the sound follows in synchronization, but immediately stops. It sort of takes away from the effect, but I imagine lightsabers with better smooth-swing functionality have better accuracy.<br /><br />One day, while charging the lightsaber after a month, the charging sound came on and kept announcing the charging state. I was a little concerned, but left it. Suddenly, the sound was rapid, then silence. I checked the lightsaber and the charging light wasn't on. I tried different outlets, but no fix. Thankfully, the lightsaber is easy to disassemble, so I checked out the battery. It seems fine, but I am awaiting a new one to make sure it's just the battery that was fried.",

The front isn't colored, though; instead, everything is the same brown color. The game can be difficult to open at times; my kids usually need parental help with prying the two doors open.<br /><br />Everything mostly is the same from the non-electronic version; the cards and pieces are identical. Of course, the main upcharge here is the electronic dome. Rather than having to place extra cards into the dome to read the riddles, players just press the dome to have a riddle displayed. Oddly, the riddles can be difficult to read still. In the non-electronic version, the riddles on the cards are encrypted by random colors; it's not until the card is placed under the dome that they become decrypted. In the electronic version, the player has to be directly above the dome in order to read what is displayed. Because of the angle of the dome and the electronic screen inside, it's difficult to read what's displayed if looking at the dome from an angle.<br /><br />One major complaint we all have is how loud the effects are. At times, we have to close our ears because the speaker is both too loud and not made well (there is \"tinny\" feedback). I checked all around the game but couldn't find a way to lower the volume.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the pieces don't fit well when putting the game away. There is no compartment to tuck everything neatly. The doors of the game close too tight against the bottom that there's hardly any wiggle room for the pieces to be put away. We have everything in a couple sandwich bags, but the timer has to be disassembled every time if we want everything to fit.<br /><br />It's a nice upgrade from the non-electronic version, but, with the current issues previously addressed, I don't think it warrants its MSRP.",

My daughters do the same now with their Polly Pocket sets (we have a few now!).<br /><br />This one comes with two figures that are made of a softer plastic, almost rubbery in nature.

Fast-forward about twelve years and now I am in my own home with a daughter who's old enough to learn.<br /><br />Upon ordering this set, I researched advice for beginners. Some argued that the stones ought to be oiled first. I got some stone-safe oil and a few drops of essential oil and oiled the stones. The stones felt great before oiling, but they felt better after. The board and bowls I oiled with mineral oil.<br />When everything dried, I read the included Way to Go booklet, and watched a few videos. My daughter and I play our first game; we both had fun, and I was glad to hear she wanted to play more games.<br /><br />For now, we're starting with the easier side, but I like that there's a complex side.

I do have an indoor helicopter that I purchased about a decade ago (the one that was all the rage on Amazon during that time), so that's been my only indoor air-R/C experience. This thing moves fast! It's very difficult to control at first because the directional inputs register very quickly, causing the drone to smack into objects. Going up and down isn't as fast as going in cardinal directions, so you have to get a feel for its positioning before registering a direction.<br /><br />About a week after I finally got them down.

    "text": "What I thought would be a fun holiday toy for my kids turned out to be a huge pain and battery guzzler. While packaged nicely, it was evident that you get a product that, in my opinion, isn't even worth the relatively low price point. The controller is made of thin plastic and has unnecessary triggers that make me wonder whether it's a generic mold that's been used for game controllers of some sort.<br />The body of the car is a bit sturdier, at least. With the fat tires, the body hardly ever touches surfaces.<br /><br />When I first took the parts out of the box the first thing I did was open up the back of the controller to put in batteries. The battery cover also has a screw to keep it in place, but I soon realized that the plastic screw (or else very cheap metal) was broken so that no matter how much I turned it it would not loosen. I didn't strip the top; the screw itself was broken. Thus, I had to bend and crack the battery cover open to get the batteries in. \"Okay,\" I thought. \"At least that'll probably be the worst of it.\"<br />Nope.<br /><br />I did the same for the car. Thankfully, that screw wasn't broken so it came off without any manipulation. The instructions state that a rechargeable battery is inside, but that's not the case. Instead, there's a compartment that requires four AAA batteries. I stock up on plenty of AA batteries, but as AAA batteries are becoming less common I had to order some. Not a big deal; I've been meaning to stock up on some anyway. And I actually prefer batteries over internal rechargeable ones as that means better longevity. (I have this twenty-year-old RC car that is useless now because the rechargeable battery is impossible to find a replacement for.)<br /><br />So I got the batteries all set and I started to play with it. As it was late at night my kids were asleep, so I figured what better way to test it before they had a chance!<br />The car moved fine. It detected all my presses. However, two big problems I noticed were: 1) to push the car forward, you have to push both triggers forward (or backward if the car's on its flip side), but every time I did the car would make a slight turn left before continuing forward. I tried countless times to see if it was me but it would not go straight before turning a slight left.<br />2) Because the underside of the car is mirrored from the top I sometimes forget that I'm supposed to reverse the controls. I wish they made the mold of the car so that they wouldn't be facing the same direction.<br /><br />Anyway, I figured my kids would have fun with it and wouldn't bother with these gripes. They woke up and noticed the car immediately on the table, and I let them have at it. For a while, they had a lot of fun, but not too long did they complain that the car wouldn't go straight. When the car would stop and they'd try to get it to go just straight, sure enough it would turn slightly left before going straight. Despite their complaints, however, they used it the entire day.<br />By the end of the day, the batteries inside the car already needed replacing. Mind you, they didn't use it every second of the day, but I was still surprised to find that the batteries needed replacing already. I changed them and thought nothing of it.<br /><br />Two days later was Thanksgiving and my kids wanted to bring it while visiting family. When we got there the car needed battery replacements yet again. In those two days prior to the holiday they used it probably a max of about half an hour. There's a switch on the car that turns it off and on, but then I realized that if it's not turned off then the batteries still are being drained. I thought we'd be fine to leave the car switched on and the batteries would be in a sort of idle state, but that was not the case. As the family we visited didn't have AAA batteries, my kids weren't able to use it. It wasn't a total loss as we had plenty of other activities to do, but even I was looking forward to using the car with a couple of pets brought by family.<br /><br />So when we got back home I replaced the batteries. When my kids went to bed I remembered to turn the car off. The next day they played with it and forgot to turn it off that night. The next day it needed replacements again. I told my kids I'm not replacing the batteries again and then I showed them this RC helicopter I had. They've forgotten about the car.",

My daughters (ages 6 and 2) loved playing with these blocks. I have a few pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The main thing that I loved about them is how quiet they are! My kids love to dump out blocks which was perfectly fine with these because they didn't make the loud noise – which I'm sure our neighbors appreciate given we are on the third floor.<br />2. These are so versatile and light weight – they'd be perfect for home, classrooms, daycares, etc. This means little kids won't have trouble picking them up/cleaning them up and they won't do a lot of damage if thrown on the floor either.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. My 2-year-old attempted to place the items in her mouth several times, which explains why the recommended age is 3 and up. I would even recommend for ages 4 and up at a minimum given the possibility of biting on the cork or the cork falling apart.<br />2. Only two sizes in the set I received.

However, we've learned not to pop the heads off as often to clean them. It's fun to swap bodies on the three quadrupeds (the bird's sections are compatible with the others), but it's such a pain to put them back together that we've resorted to leaving them alone and taking them apart only to clean.<br />The rubber floats cannot be disassembled, however, and so those will build up mold more quickly.<br /><br />The designs themselves are very nice and colorful. Filling them up with water is quick, but they don't really squirt straight. They squirt in an arc, so it's a little trickier to aim.<br />Also, I feel they might be priced a bit high, though they are nice and sturdy, and definitely far better than the other bath toys we have.

She loved this one upon immediate view, and held it the rest of the day. The accessories are a nice little touch; they're all made of the same fabric (safe for the sponge) as the doll itself, which is a very soft and cuddle-able material. The hood is fold-able, so it's nice to show my daughter that it's ready for bath time.",

    "text": "My daughter loves this, but the one flaw I'd point out firstly is that the trains don't hook on securely. Every bump over the carpet or crossing a wood threshold careens at least one of the cars away. At first I thought this was so because the company thought it would be easier for younger kids to attach them, but then I found all the little accessories and how small they were and somewhat difficult for my daughter to open, then I realized they could've done a better job of making the hooks curve more so that the cars stay attach. Hence the four instead of five stars.<br /><br />Otherwise, this play set is fantastic and my daughter has been playing with them nonstop. She loves the accessories they come with, and enjoys putting them and removing them on/from the pony. It's also great because lately she's been obsessed with trains (we live near some railroads) so this combined with her recent obsession with MLP and this toy is a hit (barring the carriage hooks).",

The pieces feel like they used to when I was a kid. Sadly, I have no idea what happened to my kit, so I can't compare.<br />That said, we immediately started building when it arrived and have tried to create the initial sculptures I used to build as a kid.

    "text": "As soon as I saw the picture in my Vine newsletter I had to order it. I am a product of the '90s--Power Rangers and TMNT were my childhood. As a child, however, I never had Dragonzord. When I landed my first job, however, the first things I purchased (well, besides suits) were a few Zords.<br />Then the Legacy line by Bandai came out years later, and it blew the original Zords away. Yes, the old ones are great for nostalgia's sake, but the Legacy ones combined metal with actual sculpted parts where stickers used to be (they even used the original Japanese designs from the show!) and they were far better than the ones made decades ago, even if they lacked electronics whatnots.<br />Now comes the Fisher-Price Imaginext line for toddlers. I've heard great things about Imaginext, and I couldn't wait for my daughter to get her own Dragonzord.<br /><br />The toy comes in an open-style box so you can fondle the Zord in all its glory without taking it out. I was pleased right away; just like the Legacy line, everything (mostly) is sculpted, and uses the original Japanese designs. No more stickers.<br />It also comes with a little Imaginext Green Ranger that fits into the chest piece, as well as a handful of missiles that shoot from the chest (inaccurate as the missiles shot from the fingers whereas electricity (?) shot from the chest--but I digress).<br />The crowning piece is that, since this is remote-controlled, the remote comes in the style of the Dragon Dagger. Fan-flippin'-tastic.<br /><br />The range is great, although admittedly we haven't used the R/C much; you will need batteries for the remote, but the Zord comes with them installed. There is a base that attaches from leg to leg that acts as the motor, and the Zord walks great and sounds great. You even get to shoot the missiles from the chest from a distance, so that's cool when we prop up Elsa against a box and blast her to smithereens (or at least until she tips over on the floor).<br /><br />All in all, both dad and daughter are pleased. Mom rolls her eyes (she never was into Power Rangers) when we shoot things or crunch smaller toys in the jaws. I even love how the hands are curled like in the original show. The Legacy edition comes with these hands as well, and those are the ones I use when displayed.",

    "text": "I personally never knew about these growing up, if they existed, but once I had my firstborn I've been seeing these more and more in toy stores (or maybe I've just been browsing toy stores more and more altogether). Initially I deemed them too much money for what they were and how many pieces came in a set. They're thin pieces of plastic with weak magnets. I'd imagine they should be a third of the price, but I'm no marketer.<br /><br />That said, after having received a set for her birthday, my daughter plays with this very frequently, even a year later. When friends and family come to visit, this is one of the main hitters when they play with her. Nevertheless, we were always short a few pieces, so, when the opportunity arose to receive another set, of course I seized the opportunity!<br />Unfortunately, this new set didn't come with the pieces we needed most (the large base ones), but it does add a ton of pieces we easily can take advantage of. The colors are much more vibrant in this set (our previous one has a darker theme), but in low lighting you won't see that stark of a contrast. Plus, kids don't really care.<br />The newer pieces we have here are smaller triangles, which helps a ton in making small roofs, etc. We use a cookie sheet as our base, and I advise strongly to use one every time you play. Makes the experience and capability that much better.<br /><br />All in all, these are great toys, even if I think they are way, way overpriced for what you get. They're constantly in play--even when I'm not home during the day, because I'm always cleaning them up at night when I get home!",

Heck, I didn't even know it was that old until I saw this on Amazon!<br /><br />While I have the Party Edition which has *way* more cards than this, that edition is half a decade old and so some of the references show age. This anniversary edition has updated terms and phrases as of 2015, so it's a bit funnier if you're playing with younger people.<br />The cards from the standard edition I think are a bit easier to work with. When we played with the anniversary set some people were mixed at times when grabbing the appropriate cards, as they're both monochrome except reverted instead of the red and green cards. The tokens, however, are a much welcome addition as they make it easier to tally the scores.<br /><br />If you had to get a quick pick-me-up set and don't care about reusing the same cards quickly, then this set is a great buy. It has modern terms and phrases, is very sleek in its nice black box, and makes it easier to keep track of score. But really, the most fun in playing this game is coming up with absurd card mixes!",

This train set was a no-brainer, and since she's getting older she'll be able to appreciate the toy more.<br /><br />The track is great and made of sturdy plastic. Of course, seeing as my daughter is one, she doesn't exactly keep Elmo or Grover on the tracks.<br />The music is great, and works even off the track (though, of course, it's better as a set).<br /><br />Elmo comes with a few songs, and the music is very loud and audible--a good thing, especially considering his small size.<br /><br />The set folds up nicely for storage. Since my daughter has a crap ton of toys, making this more portable and foldable is a nice feature.<br /><br />It's a great toy set to have, albeit at a steep price. My guess is for the licensing and electronics. The track is nice and big and sturdy, and I presume compatible with other sets in the line.",

So we decided to give it to her a week early.<br /><br />We have the picnic basket that complements this set, and it's nice overall to have both sets to play along. The volume on this tea set is great and loud, and leaves the sound chips and speakers from my infant days in the dust.<br /><br />I like that the spout is sensitive to its angle, so it knows when it's being poured and when it's \"empty.\" The colors are vibrant, corresponding to the pie flavors, and actually diminish once the supposed tea runs out. There are also modes which help distinguish how many cups it's being poured into.<br />The songs are cheerful, and my daughter loves opening and shutting the lid to hear them, as she does on the picnic basket.<br /><br />The pieces are sturdy enough to take a whacking. For the price, this set is pretty awesome, and my daughter and both my wife and I have a blast playing with it, whether it's tea time or just throwing the pieces around.",

I sometimes show her how she's *supposed* to be using them, having her get a sense of the sounds and how they are activated. The play set itself is pretty neat, and doesn't take up much room in either the living room or the little play nook in her bedroom.

    "text": "***UPDATE 08/29/13***<br />My daughter, who is one, went to grab Elmo the other day. Elmo was sitting against the couch on the floor, and my daughter grabbed his foot to bring him to her. The head fell on the floor, obviously, but there was an audible *thunk*, and my wife and I looked at each other. I immediately went to test out the doll, and found it no longer worked. I replaced the batteries, but that did nothing.<br /><br />It stinks that a simple drop from a resting position would make Elmo completely inoperable. Again, he was already sitting on the floor, so the fall wasn't that great.<br /><br />Ah, well. At least my daughter can use it as a regular Elmo doll. A $50 Elmo doll with stiff arms and a hard head.<br />***<br /><br />First thought I had: This Elmo is HUGE!<br />My daughter is only a year old, but she's already obsessed with the little red monster. We decided to get this for her, and when we opened the Amazon box we found it to be bigger than even her!<br /><br />The electronics are great and interactive, as Elmo constantly wants a hug from my daughter. Being that my daughter is not even a year old and doesn't fully understand speech and its many commands, she ignores Elmo's pleas, opting instead to hold him by his arms or legs. She'll hug him--when she wants.<br /><br />The arms are fine and seem sturdy enough, but I'm afraid they won't last long time. Hopefully they'll last as long as my daughter's infatuation with the creature, but I don't expect this one staying with the family for generations.<br /><br />It's a great Elmo to have. I think the high price is due mainly to the height of the figure. I've seen electronic toys with more gizmos go for cheaper, so my guess is the height and licensing.<br /><br />A great Elmo toy. As if the other two my daughter had weren't enough.",

I realize it's to conserve table space and make the puzzle more challenging, but it's quite a shock for someone so new to puzzles, like me.<br /><br />It was a joy to build, though it probably took me longer than it would've others.

Unfortunately, it doesn't mean it's always going to be great. Still, I noticed that my month-old daughter did find immediate comfort when I tested the soother out last week.<br /><br />It's fairly easy to install, though I still grow weary that it'll stay on the crib and won't fall on her face (it's relatively heavy). The soother is easy to attach to the base and remove, and there are settings that make it easy to dim the backscreen light and turn down the volume. However, once I realized it's not touchscreen, I sort of grew upset. I know I should've done my research and known it wasn't a touch screen before ordering, but c'est la vie.<br /><br />There are a few buttons only on the soother, which means there are going to be more steps to navigate through the menus than necessary. FP should've made more buttons to navigate easier, and a couple wheels to quickly and easily adjust the brightness and volume. You have to adjust the both each for every \"app,\" which grows rather annoying after a while. The glamorized TV for infants turned out to soothe my daughter after all, and she stayed fixated (with what limited vision she has now) on the sound and slow movements of the nighttime app. I've yet to install more apps, but the included ones seem fine for now. It really is just a TV with no interaction for my daughter.<br /><br />For the price, I'd probably go with something with which my kid can interact. I don't like the idea that she's just sitting there propped next to the soother while it plays like a TV. Otherwise, if this is something you're looking for, it seems well built (but heavy), comes with a convenient kickstand, and lets you customize and add the apps.",

This game is very difficult to keep up with due to its fast pace.  It's much harder to catch onto this game than the original version.  This game is electronic and may be more enticing for children compared to the regular Yahtzee.  It is also fairly portable which makes it convenient to take with you on trips.  However, this game is more expensive than the regular game and is not, in my opinion, worth the extra money.  Looking at all of the features of regular Yahtzee and comparing them to this digital version, I highly prefer the regular Yahtzee game versus this digital version.

The pool arrived with a cracked drain cap so it wouldn't hold water above that line. I contacted Vistop regarding a replacement cap. Initially they wanted pictures which is hard for me. The crack wouldn't show that well and I'm not great at uploading photo's. Besides, I was asking for just a new cap, not a new pool. However, after some back and forths, Vistop customer service actually sent me a whole new pool which was great service.  I'm going with 4 stars rather than 5 because I do find it hard to drain. Maybe I'm not understanding how it's suppose to be done, but I have trouble keeping the drain hole open so it will drain out. I more or less have to dump out the water by lifting it up some which I find a bit difficult. Overall, my dog really enjoys it and it does seem expansive and sturdy, so I'm pleased with both the product and the customer service.",

This set matches that description wonderfully. Beautifully constructed out of large wooden beads and painted in bright non toxic colors. The beads themselves are nicely split between fruit, vegetables and animals. Readily recognized by my three year old niece. Four beading strings tipped with a small wood stylus to make threading easier. Both girls were able to use this product, however the three year old really hit her stride with this product. She sat content with this product for between 25-45 minutes on the first session. Both girls also asked for it again later. I would use this product with supervision as there is a small chance of choking with some of the smaller beads and the stylus is pointed and could be used inappropriately (poking eyes, ears etc). Otherwise, I highly recommend this product, very reasonably priced, appears durable for toddlers through probably the early grades if you have young kids with you are working with fine notary skills etc, or you are looking for a reusable planet friendly product. Comes with a nice little carry bag as well for travel and came with some bonus stickers.",

I was expecting a standing easel, the size of this is more appropriate to something you would set on a desk or table top unless the kid sits on the floor. In addition, I both compliment and complain about the box. They clearly designed it to be as planet friendly as possibly with easy access, but when I opened it to verify that everything was intact (it came boxed with other goods from Amazon and I wanted to ensure it wasn't damaged) it was quite difficult to fit everything back in the box.

The doors work easily so they can climb right into the cab, the stickers were surprisingly easy to put on and it's fast, I mean for a toy this size it really moves!<br />The only things I can see areas of improvement are it needs a cab light- the cab is so big and in the evening it's hard to see in there- so we added a stick on light on the ceiling!<br />Also, the music could be louder but the kids really don't mind- overall it's definitely worth it!",

Definitely a kit worth your money, you can make tons of different kinds of slime. Kept my nephew busy for hours!",

Female's shoulders are really messed up and do not move correctly. Wish I would have seen this prior to tearing open the boxes, can't really return them now):<br /><br />PROS: the concept. Range of motion for the stand- stand can be posed in multiple ways, helpful for awkward positions. Small sizing is great!<br /><br />CONS: unfortunately a lot... some joints are very loose and will not hold without support. Some joints are too tight! I don't mind the tight joints cause they hold but takes a while to get them to move and then you feel like you're breaking it, but you're not. Knees for the female are not as flexible like the males. My male neck is overtop of the chest, so I can't move the head. Shoulders on female are awkward and not correct- shoulders are not moveable. Loose parts feel like they fall apart any second. Not as moveable as the picture shown or the instructions show. Just poorly made and not worth the money.<br /><br />I understand these figures are detailed in joint motion. They are also small. However, some toys are just as movable and have less problems.<br /><br />Value for money - very poorly made, cost is too high for product rating.<br />Can tell they are mass produced and no quality check.<br />Would return and consider another brand if I didn't tear open the boxes in excitement. Excitement plummeted after trying to pose them in simply positions.",

I emptied the box upside down , \"apparently none, I am sorry baby\" one tear fell from her eye.  yes she is spoiled, yes I tried to avoid that because I know it will only backfire later in life, but I split custody and have no control what goes on during half of her life.  I do my best.  When the sequins were also missing it was a total meltdown.  I wish I had totally checked for all these things before setting it out to decorate, because I would have tried to hide it from my daughter and wished she forgot it existed.<br /><br />I do not recommend , after seeing all the broken reviews, and they can forget 2 items obviously mentioned as essential parts of the kit.  Also the metallic paint was heavily lacking.<br /><br />Thanks for a traumatic experience.",

I take no pride in admitting to you that since the Besosay Retra Handheld Game Console has arrived, my husband and I 'call' it in the same way we 'called' the front car seat. \"I'm playing the console right after dinner!\".<br /><br />I kid you not. This system is SO much fun!<br /><br />400 classic arcade games are on this small, lightweight device. I actually expected the screen to be black and white...its not! Its in color!  It comes fully loaded and ready to play. The buttons are easy to use the screen is nice and clear. It even has sound!  Its operated either using a lithium battery (included) or via a television where you can play on a big screen. (cable included!) We scrolled through the 400 games and found SO many familiar retro games but also a lot we've never heard of before. We haven't even played 1/2 the games yet!<br /><br />I do have a small issue to mention, however. While it does come with instructions about the device itself, there are no instructions explaining what buttons should be used and how they work for each game. We had to play  for awhile in order to figure out which buttons made a game jump, shoot, move, etc. Once we familiarized ourselves, we were good to go.<br /><br />I am positively FLOORED at the unbelievably low price of this game console. It truly is a steal. It makes a wonderful gift even for those not familiar with retro video games. This delightful device literally provides hours and hours of entertainment.  How could it not with 400 games?  This is an item you don't need to waste anytime trying to decide if you should buy it or not.<br /><br />BUY IT! You're going to LOVE it!",
