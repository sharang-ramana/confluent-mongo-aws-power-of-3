The other smaller magnets aren't very strong, though the horseshoe is strong enough. We like the variety of balls and chips. And I love that they provided a nice storage box!! It opens nicely and is sturdy. Everything goes back in with room to spare, so no cramming. So overall a quality product, a bit overpriced, with some really good features and some smaller magnets that need to be stronger to be very useful. I'm glad I bought it (at a lightning deal price).",

I've got an otterbox) but that's ok with me.  I knew that going into buying this so this might be a non starter for some.  My kids only use with me so I don't mind taking my otter box my phone and using this (note I'm using this with my iPhone 8 Plus).  I've not used with our iPad but will update review once we do.  3) my kids LOVE this.  They love reading the stories on our ceiling.  We pile up in my bed (my kids are 5 and 7) and read bedtime stories on the ceiling 4) it has music which is a nice touch or you can mute it but the sound effects can be cute in some of the books 5) the selection of some popular books is a great touch, although we have most them in hard back or paper form they love having some of these titles on our Moonlite 6) family bonding, while we do read books before bed this adds a nice touch to change it up and make it more fun, my kids truly get excited to read our moonlite stories so although this doesn't replace our nightly routine stories given we only have about 6 titles right now it's a great supplement to change up the routine and make story time even more fun.  I highly recommend this if you have young kids and are looking for something to make bed time reading more fun.",

I am giving this three stars because we do love the Disney doorables and we haven't opened up our two other sets yet but felt the need to note that one of our doorables came deformed.  Of course it was the furry rare one.  The rabbits ears were broken off and looks like they were melted as other have noted so I am guessing this was a quality control issue.  I'm hoping it was isolated as we have two more boxes she's getting as birthday presents but overall we are happy the Disney Doorables and love the ones we have.

    "text": "I bought one of these as a big box store for $10 more.  I loved ours so much that I bought mine on Amazon for my sister kids.  I have 4yo daughter and 6yo son who has Autism and both my kids love this set.  Note, as other have reviewed it is very messy so this is not an activity where you can leave your kids to do on their own.  This is definetly a family activity unless you have an older child who can help.  My 13 yo babysitter did this activity with them with no problem but note it did make a mess so it requieres clean up but I would recommend regardless if you don't mind the mess.  Used some plastic disposable table cloths underneath to contain the mess.  Kids had a blast making fun things with this (i.e. pizza, bacon, ice cream, etc). If you are looking for a fun family activity than this is your item.  If you are looking for something for more independent play than I would not recommend this item.  Note, my sisters kids are 13 yo and 9 and they loved this set as well.  My sister and I did the same thing, we would make the orbeez early in week and let them play with those for a few days storing them every night in plastic containter and by end of week used the beads for the orbeez crush set that way our kids got multiple uses out of the beads.",

    "text": "Mix feelings about this product.  Had it over a year with minimal travel usage.  We usually leave it in our dining room on our kids table so they can do activities while mom cooks.  We loved it when it worked but once the batteries died and I replaced the device with new batteries, it turns on and does nothing.  It doesn't sense the stylus.  It will on a random occasion after multiple attempts say one or two words when pointed on the stylus but then stops again.  Changed batteries out a couple of times and unfortunately didn't help.  Now, I have two disappointed kids with numerous of these books and told family to get more books for Christmas which will only be to their disappointment that they have no device to use them with.<br /><br />As for when the device worked, we would loved it and would recommend to any parent with kids under 7.  My son is almost 5yo son and 3yo daughter love this.  They take turns using it since I only had one of the Leap Start devices but numerous books.  My daughter was heart broken after multiple attempts to try new batteries.<br /><br />I hate to give one start but given the longevity of this product for the price, it needs to last more than a year.  I mean one year for a $45 device.  Maybe some would say that's worth it but not when you shell out $10 - $15 on each of the books.  I might of gotten a faulty device so maybe it's just poor luck on my part.<br /><br />UPDATE—7/1118<br />We've had our new leapstart book (this time I bought at big box store with a warranty)  for 5 months now since the last broke, so far so good but I'm still not sure on longevity still, however i have changed batteries a few times since we use ours alot and have had no issues.  I am adding a star as my kids fight over this all the time.  I've got 6yo boy who LOVES it who is also my reader and 4yo girl who always wants what her brother has but genuinely love this thing.  I struggle with getting my kids to play with their $100 toy they got for Christmas but love this thing and it's a plus for me since it's educational.  So i still can't give this item as high of a star as I would like because of durability I would recommend it if you don't care if you have to replace it.  I'm glad I did but recommend getting some warranty because after investing in the books and how much my kids like It, you may want to get another.",

The center piece is metal but the plastic wing already came off.  I am going to try and &#34;super glue&#34; it back on but please note, this one probably won't hold up to much playing with.  We've had no issues with any of the other ships or toys.  I am super bummed as my son and I love Darth Vader so we both were super stoked about this ship.",

I don't want to say this isn't a cute toy because my son who loves Paw Patrol and has all the characters loved this toy however, he barely uses it because the slide won't stay on there and toy tips over.  The badge on the front does come off and plays Ryder talking or the theme song and so thats a bonus as both of my kids like to run around and play with that.  The telescope is truly a little telescope but neither of my kids really played with that.  Given the slide issue and it doesn't stay up, I can only give two stars because they rarely get to play with it given those two factors.

I have a 1 1/2 year old girl and 3 year old boy and both end up fighting over every day.  They both love this toy.

I had a similar toy as a kid (FisherPrice one) and it was one of my favorite toys.  I am glad I bought this one for the kids (I didn't realize it would be such a hit).  I will say, you will need to keep track of the 9 coins and card and dollar bill.  It seems like a full time job for mommy but best $15 I ever spent on a toy.  Kids love it so mom loves it!",

I purchased this because my son was out of his infant car seat at 6 months and we had to transition him to a convertible car seat and since there was no bar for his hanging toy I bought this for a long 8 hour road trip.  My son is now 2 and I've since tooken it off the car seat so we can transition it to my newborn daughters car seat when she transitions to the convertible car seat.  My 2 yo son still loves this.  I brought it up in his sissy's room and use it on her rock and play sleeper when I am pumping and she loves looking at it.  My son was very mad that she now has it and when not looking carries it around the house with him.  He literally still loves this thing.  We used it every day until he was about 18 months in the car (basically because I was tired of hooking it on and off).  I am sure if I wanted to my son would still love the thing on his car seat.  It hooked on great on my Britax Pavillion…I did struggle to keep it on my Safety 1st Pro Air Convertible Car Seat.  I've never tried it on my Chicco Key Fit because we have the bar to hang other toys on.  I have used it on my Fisher Price Rock and Play Sleeper when I've had my daughter in there while pumping and she loved looking at it.  Also, again my toddler loves walking around and playing with it still.  When I purchased this, I didn't think this would be such a staple purchase but I am very glad I made this purchase and would recommend this to anyone with a convertible car seat.",

We love Little People products and the regular farm set is his favorite.  My son is 2 and I think this would be better suited for maybe a 4 year old.  The app is very interactive and lets him explore the farm and meet other animals, farm, etc.  Again, I think the premise if very good and my son will get more use as he gets older but I am displeased with the set up and flimsy case.  It's definitely work getting the iPad in and out of the case for this which is good and bad.  Good because they toddler can't get my iPad out but bad because it's hard getting the thing to show up on the right side correctly.  The iPad wants to flip to whatever side you are viewing thus you have to put the iPad just right otherwise it displays upside down.  Once you get past that there are some settings you have to configure and then finally the case on the top in my opinion is very flimsy.  My son has already scratched the case on the top (not my iPad thankfully) with adult supervision.  I never let him play with this by himself.  I try to play and interact with him as I am not about to hand over my iPad to a 2 year old.  To sum it up, it's a cute concept, I love Little People but I just don't think the case is very sturdy as I am afraid if I walked away my two year old let alone a 4 year old would be able poke a hole in the screen case real easy and onto my iPad.",

I helped him paint a few pics myself and it washed off very easily off my hands, the kitchen counter and his clothes.  I bought him a crayola smock as well but he still managed to rub it on his pants.  I was very pleased that it came off.  I would highly recommend these.  It was a lot of fun for him and me!",

    "text": "This toy is great in theory...We have an old iPod we got free with our computer that we never use so I put that in here for my 9 month old at the time.  He loves our iPhones and is always trying to grab at those so I thought this would be a great toy for him.  Unfortunately he's not interested in it at all.  The apps are easy to download and are great learning tools however, there is one of the apps that makes an annoying sound and won't go to the next screen unless you touch it.  He might like it as he gets older but for now, it just sits in our toy box.<br /><br />However, this has made for a great toy for my friends kids that are 3 or older but not to play with the FP apps.  They want to play other apps on the iPod so it does make for a good case for toddlers.  One dropped it on the concrete and hardwood floor and didn't break and did no damage to iPod or the case for that matter.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great case for toddlers but as a learning toy (it's just ok).",

This one definitely fit the bill.  He also likes to spin things.  On the front there is a little spinner that he loves to play with.  He loves just looking at the lantern light up and sing.  I bought this thinking he would like this more as a toddler than now since it doubles as a type of flashlight for toddlers to use and the bedtime music so it was my surprise to find that he already loves it.  I would recommend this for 9months to 4 or 5 year olds.  My 4 year old nephew thought it was really cool and wanted one as well.",

I really like the fact that she could cut the fruit instead of those plastic fruit pieces you can by at the store.  Also, like the crate it came in which was very sturdy and worked as a great cutting board for her fruit.  I was disappointed because I thought these were magnetic not velcro and maybe I should of read the reviews before I bought the set.  The velcro worked however, like other reviewers the pieces didn't fit together as good as I would of liked.  They are great for cutting but for pretend playing and pretending its a whole piece of fruit would be rather difficult for it to stay together.  I think the toy was great, she loved it which is what mattered but for the price, I guess I expected a little more.",

I really don't have any complaints however, my friend had a hard time putting it on her grandson because she didn't see there were button on the pants besides the opening in the back.  I had to show her there were snaps on the pants since it wasn't very apparent unless you were looking for them.  I only knew because my son's lion costume was the same way.  Also, I would mention that it was thin so it wouldn't be a good costume to wear without a coat if your Halloween's are like the Midwest where it's typically very cold on Halloween.",

I was very hesitant in purchasing this since this wasn't exactly the same one he wanted but I am glad I didn't as my husband loves this one.  He mentioned that he was glad I got him this one because it's so fast that if he got the other one that's faster, he would of had an extremely hard time maneuvering.  He said this one was fast enough for him to learn on how to handle.  Additionally, this has been a very durable RC and he uses it in our Culdesac, street and even our yard.  He loves it!

It's very easy to do. It's also very easy to undo. Within two minutes of playing with the toy, my three year manages to remove the propellers every. single. time. She isn't quite able to snap it back in herself, so this results in \"Mommy fix Zuma\". Not such a big deal the first 200 times, somewhat annoying after that.

    "text": "Soooo, I had high hopes for these markers. I thought my little one would be highly amused by writing in three colors at once (she was mildly amused for a short period of time). I think the issue is that in order to get the even three color lines when writing or stamping or coloring, you have to hold the marker perfectly upright and ensure all three tips are somewhat evenly on the paper. This is not easy for little hands (my little one is almost 3). I myself had to concentrate to create the images I posted. It's much easier to end up with 2 of the colors in a line or even one depending on how you hold the marker.<br /><br />The colors individually are nice, but sometimes when they cross over, they create kind of ugly mixes and combinations. Again, this depends on how steadily you hold the marker and what colors you have on top or bottom (as shown by the squiggles under my first picture).<br /><br />All in all, I would call this an interesting novelty - for slightly older kids. I'm guessing my little one might make some stamps and then these will go in with the rest of the markers. If she was doing more freeform drawing - it might be more amusing.",

    "text": "My Tot is obsessed with numbers, colors, shapes, and letters. These puzzles are a great way to practice all of the above.<br /><br />What we like:<br />- Very Bright and Colorful<br />- Seems sturdy. It's clearly made of wood. The base and the pieces are pretty thick. I can't bend them, so I'm assuming the Little one can't either<br />- Engages multiple senses and areas of learning. Each letter piece has a picture and word of something starting with that letter under it. For example Z has a picture of a zipper and the word zipper. The numbers have the number spelled out and then that number stamps of some shape. For example the 2 piece has 2 red hearts so we can practice colors, words, shapes, and counting at once.<br />- The pieces are made into animals or have eyes in certain places - it's very cute.<br /><br />The few nits (things to note)<br />- The images are painted on to unfinished wood. That means it can be easy to scratch a piece and lose some color. I think the colors will also fade over time because there doesn't seem to be a finish sealing everything.<br />- Some of the pieces are hard to get just right into their places. We have consistent problems with the G. Not a big deal, but can cause toddler frustration.<br /><br />I will note that when you open the puzzles, go through and remove each piece before the kiddo does to loosen it up. Our first play session, some of the pieces were sticking and even harder to get back into place. It has all smoothed out as she plays with the puzzles more.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a great product and we love it despite the few little nits I noted above.",

    "text": "I purchased this toy in a desperate attempt to save my own laptop from my 6 month old. She loves to bang on the keys of my laptop whenever it's open and I thought if she had her own, perhaps we could both get some “work” done in peace. Alas, she still prefers to bang on my laptop. However, she does enjoy this toy.<br /><br />She has definitely grown into it more at 20 months. She likes all three modes and I like that it has volume control. The mouse is an actual mouse that loves (very cute). One somewhat freaky downside is if the laptop is closed, but powered on and you accidentally hit the mouse or jiggle any part of it - it begs you to “Open the laptop to learn”. Great if you know it's there or the kid is playing with it (banging it around) with the kid closed. Freaky if it's in the middle of the night and gets jostled somehow and you hear that freaky voice from nowhere.<br /><br />This thing is durable. I have had it for over a year now and LO has thrown it banged it, spent the first few months just lifting the lid and slamming it down again (not gently) and so forth. I was sure it would not last a year, but it's still ticking.<br /><br />Downside, the screen is like light up dots - probably helps with durability, but doesn't really make it realistic. It also kind of Boring (the screen). It doesn't light up different colors or engage all that much. It flashes and scrolls. They should definitely work on that for a next version. Boring screen made it lose one star overall.<br /><br />Songs are catchy. I find myself singing them at work “1,2,3,4,5 circles, triangles, squares ....” and so on. Blessing and a curse. Little one likes to play on the piano keys and it will sound out a song while she plays. For a minute I thought my kid was a prodigy playing row row your boat - then I realized she didn't have enough notes on the keyboard... Alas, I bet hearing it while she “plays” makes her feel smart. All in all, a good purchase.",

This was hands down the WORST thing i've ever put together and I have an Ikea wardrobe system I put together myself. It came out of the box as a pink shell and a myriad of wheels, plastic pieces, axles, stickers, etc. the directions sheet was like a bad fax. The pictures were so dark you could barely see how thing fit together and there were no words only letters that label pieces you can barely make out. In order to get the wheels on the axles and on the car, you have to use pliers and a wrench at the same time - be prepared to be handy to get this together and to contemplate tossing the whole thing out the door. A few hours later we had a functioning car that felt generally stable. I'm still not entirely sure the seat belt is on the right way, but after assembling it 4 different ways, there just doesn't seem to be a right way and I holds the little one in place, so I gave up.<br /><br />It's pretty roomy. The cup holders fit bottles of water, cans, and of course sippy cups. My LO is 18 months and dits fine and will enable to ride in this for a long time to come. She loves to go for walks in this. I have to be careful about the time of day since there is no sunshade.<br /><br />Now, I paid extra for the whisper quiet version of this toy. Don't bother. It is NOT quiet. It tumbled along the side walk pretty loudly. I can only imagine what the non-whisper quiet version is like. I don't think the noise reduction. Is worth the extra cost as it's loud. It also doesn't maneuver worth a darn. If you need to turn, move to the side, or anything that is not just straight, you basically end up dragging it. It goes over most bumps okay, but we have hit a few large sidewalk bumps that caused us to have to pop a wheelie.<br /><br />My kid loves this thing. I'll forever have nightmares about having to assemble it and then listen to it rumble through the streets.",

    "text": "For the record, I rue the day I purchased this ball popper for all of the reasons my little one loves it.<br /><br />With the press of a the smiley faced lever thing, she is fascinated by extremely loud carnival sounding music and balls popping out of tube, into the tray (sometimes - or around the room other times) and another ball popping out - rinse and repeat. If you only have 3 of the balls going at once, most of the time, they will pop out of the toy into the tray. If you have more than that, then chances are they are going to be flying around the living room. The balls are a nice size, so no worries about little ones choking on them. The opening of the toy is big enough to fit legos and other things (they will not pop up - they are too heavy). It's also easy to extract the legos from the tube by turning the toy over and yes, my little one likes to put her big legos (and anything else that will fit) in this toy in hopes of seeing it pop up. Thank goodness, nothing else seems to work besides the light balls included.<br /><br />My only real complain with this toy is it only has one volume - REALLY FREAKING LOUD (which is why it got 4 stars instead of 5). Many of the toys we've purchased have two volume options so you can put it on the lower volume when you are watching TV, trying to think, or just want some peace of mind. This one doesn't have that and it's so loud. Have I mentioned it's loud? We have a lot of noisy toys and only two of them bother me, this one and the Dora microphone.<br /><br />With that said, my kid really enjoys this and it will keep her occupied for precious minutes at a time. If you can stand the noise - this is definitely a winner.",

It's probably blasphemy to say, but the volume of the ball might be a bit too low (every toy should have multi-volume controls, at least a low and high volume).

Seriously, she'll sit with this book for  a good 20-30 minutes listening to all the songs.<br /><br />Besides baby Shark, there are 9 other Shark themed hits that you will recognize Like \"There was a yellow shark and shark was his name OH, S-H-A-R-K\" (sang to the tune of There was a farmer who had a dog) and twinkle twinkle little shark. There is even a holiday remix of Baby Shark.<br /><br />Your kid will love this book.

There are no adjustment points on either strap. You could use a couple of paperclips and a piece of cardboard to make the mask fit a smaller or child's head.<br />The mask feels well made, the material was much thicker than i had expected with the straps securely attached. The texturing and artwork are rather similar to the advertisement although the shadows on mine could have been a bit darker but that's just nit-picking. The mask fit me well, snugly but not uncomfortably so. I could see well enough out of the existing eye holes without having to modify them. The nose holes did an okay job of disguising my own nose. I could breathe fairly well while wearing it. This mask looks quite spooky,  it scared and annoyed my roommate (I'm in a nursing home) and annoyed my nurse. I'm quite satisfied with this mask. I would have preferred a full head piece but I have a deep hoodie.",

They would not fit in my adult ears so I doubt they'll fit any child's ear. Of note every time you turn the unit on (right hand side of the unit) the volume comes on playing music at its loudest setting. It take 4 presses of the volume button to get it muted. This is especially annoying if you're playing late and don't want to disturb others.<br />There's more than 180 games on this device. One complete game section is of educational and teaching games for kids. There's also puzzle games, action, table (no idea why it's called this), sports and relaxing games. Each category has approximately 30 games plus the main menu has an additional 18 games of various types. I played quite a few, I didn't do well at any but I was distracted for an hour or so and I expect I'll try more of the games as time goes by. My issues arise from arthritis and large adult hands.

When fully extended (75% chance of snapping open with a wrist flip the rest of the time it stick closed) the blade is rather short and doesn't really feel like the lightsabers in the movies. The sounds it makes are also mediocre. It makes almost a lightsaber sound when you turn it on but then, just sitting there in your hand, it makes a VERY loud buzzing sound that in no way mimics the low hum the movie lightsabers make, it's grating and annoying. The sounds it makes when you strike the blade against something, that's not too bad. They're fun but not exceptional.

This alone should be improved, perhaps with several interchangeable magnifying lenses. The plastic monsters are. . . cute but they're small, non articulate, they don't do anything, although one had a hole in its belly so now it sits and spins on top of my 3D printer. You get two aliens in this pack, one who's loose and a second that's inside an egg made of, it foams like denture cleaner or Alka-Seltzer, some dye coated substance. You put it in a pan or pail of water, it foams a bit (it wasn't exciting) and out pops a little container with your second alien inside. There's some data sheet type information, taxonomy identification by body type and style. Interesting until you're done then it's done and on a shelf or in the closet gathering dust. It's an interesting item but I think it's attention time is seriously limited.",

    "text": "These are beautiful playing cards. Heavy duty, durable, extremely well printed standard card and royalty suits. The back of the deck is an attractive snake, sword and branch print. My deck is advertised as blue but they're so dark they're nearly black. Still attractive though. Very stiff. Initially difficult to shuffle but they'll break in. The box is very pretty with embossed gold print and is also quite heavy duty. Very nice cards though they seem, at the time I write this, a little pricy. They are a premium product.",

    "text": "I'm only giving it two stars because it gives me the giggles making up scatological puns and toilet humor when I look at it or show it to friends otherwise It'd be a solid one (see!) trending down (I can't stop!). I don't know what the final price will be, I've seen it insanely high and just ridiculously high. To be honest, if I saw the in the Dollar Store FOR a dollar and no more I'd buy a dozen and send them to my sillier friends. Beyond a great joke gift this is junk. I doubt it would hold a child's attention for more than a couple minutes tops. It's fairly cheap, thin plastic that topples easily. The seat won't stay up (just like a real toilet). The spring that's supposed to shoot your. . . scat in the air fires the moment you let go of it. There's no way you can press it down, drop in one of the two turds it comes with (see image), close the lid and 'watch it fly' as per the instructions. I've managed the task twice out of dozens of attempts. It's very easy to clog the toilet (see image) and even if you get it right it doesn't fly, it plops (I can't help myself) an inch or two away. The toilet lacks a handle, a small detail but one that would add realism. The figures they come with are sloppily painted. At anything more than a buck it's overpriced and suitable only as a joke gift. Be kind, don't give this to your kids.<br /><br />Edit 01-22-18: Being serious for a moment here. I wanted to comment on the 'Squishy' description in the product's title. While this company may produce similar toys that are soft and pliable the ones that came with this toilet launcher are NOT. They are hard plastic and a potential choking hazard. The arms on the 'log' are especially fragile and could easily be broken off. I feel the four (4) year old age limitation set by the manufacturer is much too young. Please, use caution when giving this product to younger children. Thank you.",

Even the shortest experiment takes quite a while to complete and while the box says 'Just Add Water' you need more than just water. Do you have clear, 16 oz. disposable plastic cups laying around? I don't, and you need them to do several of the experiments. The kit comes with three small cups and aa plastic cap to do certain experiments in. I think Just Add Water should be just that and come with everything necessary to do all the experiments and a larger warning that every experiment requires adult supervision. It would help to mention on the box that not everything necessary is included and some take quite time which might annoy some younger, impatient, children. In the end it's okay but I didn't go crazy over it and honestly wouldn't recommend the kit to any but the most science interested children who have adults who can be around to supervise as some of the chemicals included can be harmful.",

    "text": "whatever you do, don't just wrap this up and give it as a gift to a child, maybe they'd have better luck but it was a nightmare for me to get this out of the packaging. There's tape everywhere, including a cover over the screen. The unit itself it held in with clips you have to turn, a twist-tie that holds the stylus as well as tape that blocks the cord that holds the stylus in place.<br />On top of that nightmare it says to erase the screen turn the unit over and shake it four times. I've had a horrible time trying to get the screen to erase. I've shaken it 20 - 50 times and the picture I drew was still there. The I held it still and voilà the screen turned black. Sometimes the screen seems  to erase in sections while it sits upright doing nothing. When it's working it's actually kind of fun. The stylus writes well thin and thick and the stampers are double sides and can leave stars, clouds, circle & crown plus the edges can be used to draw straight double lines a half inch apart on the screen. It's got some flaws but it can be a lot of fun to play with. I can't say it's a great toy, not with the hassles and problems it's given me plus, for some reason it takes two button batteries (it comes with them pre-installed but doesn't mention on average how long they'll last) that require a screwdriver and likely a trip to a specialty battery shop or some place that sells watch batteries as it doesn't say what size batteries it takes.",

    "text": "This this is awesome. For something that easily sits on the palm of your hand the detail is pretty sharp. It honestly looks like a World War ][ Tiger tank with tons of details. I received the standard, mostly green, camouflage there's also a darker camouflage and a blue tank available. Colors appear to ship randomly. Remote control device coloring also seem to match the tank you get.<br />This little thing really zips around. I was surprised at how quick it gets up and goes. There's also a super speed button on the controller that adds fifty percent to the speed of the tank. There's also engine noises and what I'm guessing are 'track' sounds are this races around. The turret will turn 360° in one direction, I found going one way the barrel would hang up on the antenna but the turret rotation switches back and forth as you rotate. The barrel also raises and lowers as the turret turns. When you press the fire button there's the sound of a cannon firing and the entire tank body recoils backwards.<br />The remote control takes four double A batteries and the tank itself charges from a cable attached to the side of the remote. Charging time is fairly quick and I've already gotten several hours of fun out of the tank and it's still going strong. The only reason I can't give it four stars is the tank just won't drive in a straight line. You can someone adjust for the tendency to turn by steering left or right as you go but it would have been just that much cooler if it had driven in a straight line. Still, I'm a fully grown adult and this is one of my favorite things. It's just such a gas to play with.<br />I received this item in exchange for my review.",

While the names may have changed (to protect the easily offended) the colors and quality of the crayons themselves are, as far as my memory is concerned, identical to the crayons I used forty five years ago. The box the crayons come in on the other hand is much thinner and flimsy than the boxes of the past. I like the new, to me, location of the sharpener which does an okay job and has a decent amount of space for shavings before it needs to be emptied. Do be careful though. I found the bottom flap flopped open too easily and is likely to make a mess. I think I'll put a small piece of tape on the box to hold the bottom closed.",

The one thing I liked better in the old model was that the shadow of the LEM wasn't pressed into the base. I was in 5th grade at the time and some idiot broke a landing leg during the science fair. I bought the same model again about three years later and the LEM's shadow, like this kit, had the shadow pressed into the base. No matter. Some putty and careful smoothing took care of that. When you make it, be careful with the struts for the legs. Definately tricky. Otherwise, enjoy!!!!",

    "text": "We bought this wagon for our toddler grandson. I don't like putting things together so when I opened it I wasn't thrilled. First off, i couldn't find the hardware--nuts and bolts. I found them in the bigger wheel package. From there it was a breeze. Instructions were pictures and showed pics of correct bolts, etc., to use at each point. 20 minutes later, I was done.<br /><br />This is probably the best instruction book I have ever seen. I did watch a 3 1/2 minute You Tube video a few times but didn't have to refer to it with these instructions. You can also see a video on Radio Flyer's web site when you register online.<br /><br />This stroller wagon was better built than the pull only wagon and well worth the extra 50 bucks. Has a better handle, push handle on the back, bigger rear tires, and easy mount canopy, I was concerned the pull handle wouldn't be long enough for me, a 6-foot-3 grandfather with aging back, but the extended length it was plenty long enough for me.<br /><br />The push handle adjusts to several positions, one of them being about the same height as your regular stroller. It's long enough for one or two kids and has harnesses at both ends with room for a few toys. Pockets on one end for water bottles for you or juice bottles for children. It has a pocket on the other side but it doesn't open wide enough except for a few magazines (think behind the seat pockets on airplanes).<br /><br />The back wheels are BIG and the stroller is wider in back than front. Oh, and it has an easy brake system on it unlike the cheaper handle only version. Spend the extra 50 dollars for this feature alone. It will still easily fit between doorways and folds up easily also by pulling a handle strap in the middle of the wagon. It folds up tight, but may take a bit more room in the boot of your car.<br /><br />I don't really have any cons about this wagon stroller. Except, I remember when wagons were more for kids than adult convenience. I mean, when they reach age 4 or 5, they can't stick a knee in it, steer with the handle, and push with their other foot for a smooth Radio Flyer ride like we used to do, can they. Luckily, they still have the pull for a ride with this model.",

    "text": "I didn't expect anything great for the price and I knew this set would probably be small but I expected something a little better and bigger.<br /><br /> The wood tracks would be difficult for a three-year-old and my two-year-old grandson wouldn't be able to do it. Its not that the system is hard for a youngster to figure out, it's just that the tracks don't fit quite right and the train doesn't stay in the track grooves all that well, especially around corners. It's a rough cut and a youngster will likely derail here. Update Here: \"My grandson has managed to put the tracks together except the bridge. Still, the pieces don't fit smoothly.\"<br /><br />My next gripe is the plastic bridge that comes with it as the second straight piece. It is a sloped hill and when the engine and coal car go over it tends to derail over the hump. Additional cars make it do so more.<br /><br />The cars are small and the track is about 18 \"inches from end to end. The bodies are wood, but the wheels and lower frame are plastic. The detail is just OK. I bought the Percy engine and another engine with a back-hoe shovel for about $10 each bringing my total to about $42. I feel I didn't get much for the money.<br /><br />If I had it to do again, I would probably just buy the vehicles and skip the set with track and let my grandson play with the cars on the floor. I bought the wood set probably out of nostalgia and because I thought it would be good quality. Quality is not that bad but not nearly as good as the old days. Next time I go to a fair and see someone selling home-made toys for kids, I'll buy one.<br /><br />I thought I might add more pieces to this set and buy more tracks if the set was good, but will not now.",

Resistance is only fair with too much deformation IMO.  There is no PDF that I can find to help guide what they think I should be doing to improve my hands.  It also can double a a superball, which makes some of my traditional hand exercises more difficult.  The weight is nil, so there is no benefit to the arms.

This game is unique in that it adapts for all ages to play.  One caution, the five year old playing with a bunch of teenagers probably will not be the best, but you can play with your grandkids and let them have a fun, quick-paced experience.  Also, it is a quick-to-learn game.  We love it.  I've purchased multiple sets for home and for gifts.",

It is well built and sturdy. This product was an instant favorite with 3 1/2 year old granddaughter.  She could work it and play with it immediately.<br />Pros:<br />*  Size is just right for little people's hands.<br />*  Software (after initial problem-see below) is well thought out for children<br />*  Kids love it and it is the \"go-to\" favorite.<br />Cons:<br />*  2 of 3 extra purchase software titles would not \"play\" load to our computer(s) to then download to iXL.  Received message to the effect that \"internet access required\". We of course had wireless internet access and it worked to download the first software title.  We tried and tried on the other two but those two titles would not load. So,we called customer service, the FP customer service was great and the problems were solved quickly. The two titles that would not play were Version 1.0.  The one title that would load was purchased at in retail store in another state and was, as luck would have it, Version 2.0.  It loaded and played perfectly.  Customer service (over the phone) had me give them the 20 digit number from each software package.  FP sent replacement software ... Version 2.0 ... and they sent them quickly.  BOTH RAN PERFECTLY.<br /><br />We have purchased the case for the iXL.  It is a nice place to keep it and makes it easier to find.  This gets a lot of use.  It is a purchase I would do again.  In fact I have just purchased two more software titles and if there is a problem, I know we can remedy them very easily.<br /><br />Good purchase, kids love it, so do parents and grandparents.",

Note:  have had problems with two of the programs for this system.  Scooby-Doo and Mickey's playhouse both gave us error messages saying \"need wireless network\".  We will call Fisher-Price to find out why these won't down load.  The Disney Princesses software loaded right away - no problems and it is great along with the software that is factory installed.

I wound up moving the snaps on the back of her gown to make it fit more as it should,  and as often I find is the case with a new Barbie, collector or otherwise, I did have to redo her hair.  That can be somewhat time consuming but fairly easily done with foil-wrapped pipe cleaners and a careful 10 to 15  second's application of heat; say, a curling iron at low setting. Leaving the hair wrapped around the foil/pipe cleaners until cool (or over night) resets the curl. It's worth the effort, as this doll, as well as the 'Golden Angel' Barbie are both just beautiful!",

It feels like a mashup of dominoes and scrabble, only with colors, too. ***HOWEVER*** if you are red-green color blind, don't bother. The colors on some of the tiles look very similar to those with this condition: blue and purple look identical to me, for example. This made playing the game much more difficult for me than it was for everyone else. In addition to the need to think spatially, and in terms of patterns and combinations of symbols, I also had the added challenge of not being able to tell which color was which--I literally had to ask for help figuring out the colors every single time. This was extremely frustrating and completely ruined the game for me. It was like torture. Not enjoyable or fun. I can see it being a lot of fun for those without color blindness, but for me, it was completely unplayable. I have attached a picture of the game tiles--if the top two rows of tiles look the same to you (as they do for me), you won't be able to play this game. I understand they make a version for the color-blind--awesome. Go find that and buy it instead.",

Worse, if you play in dim light, the low contrast of the painted glow numbers makes it hard to read them when the glow fades and you try straining your eyes to read them instead of relying on the glow. I may get a blacklight and try charging them with that instead to see if it helps, but I charged them under 8 really bright clear globes with poor results. Very, very disappointed. Cannot recommend.

    "text": "The balloons look cute-the cow print is nice. However as soon as you open the plastic packaging you are hit with a SUPER STRONG WHIFF of PAINT THINNER. There is NO WAY these balloons were made with any safe/legal paint/coloring/material. If I had a baby in the house, I would have immediately thrown them outside. As it was, we only blew up a few and the smell was so nauseating we felt sick and the entire 1st floor of our house smelled like we spilled paint thinner. I put the unused ones in a plastic bag and sealed it tight after deciding it was not worth the risk to my health to blow them up or have them in my house. The house STILL SMELLED like poison for several hours and into the next morning from the 4-5 balloons we did blow up. I would venture to say this is made with toxic material and it's definitely not worth exposing yourself to for cute balloons. The factory where these are made should be looked into; I worry about the workers!",

I definitely feel my drone is protected while in the case and the foam is cut nicely to handle all of the batteries, drone, controller, etc just fine.  I have no issues with this case and love it.  I will admit it has become my backup though as there was another brand I preferred just a little more but for no particular reason.  If that one ever breaks, I for certain will use this one.

I'm old, so I was a kid when classic NES came out.  The games still hold their playability to this day, however, I rarely touch this thing.  My kids play it more than I do and once the battery dies it takes us weeks before we get around to charging it to play it again.  Basically what I'm saying is, it's nothing special.  The buttons are awkward.  I know they are giving you the B/A buttons and B/A turbo versions of the buttons but the configuration feels odd to me compared to any other controller out there.  If they rotated the button configuration 45 degrees it would feel more natural.  Many of the \"500\" games are just variants of the same game which is the same you see on most of these emulator products.  Basically it's nothing special, gets very little use by me, but my kids love it (when it's charged).  We haven't bothered with the TV connecting aspect because I have that Nintendo made one which we just added the ROMs we wanted to.",

    "text": "When I saw this case I wanted to give it a shot.  I was looking through numerous styles and saw this one available so I snagged it.  The build quality is nice and everything fits in there perfectly.  The case is not a completely hard shell.  It will definitely protect the drone in the case of falls I would imagine however I would not stack anything heavy on top of this case unlike those air tight plastic cases with the double latches and all you see on here.  It's great for carrying your drone around over your shoulder and provides enough protection that you won't have to worry about anything happening while you're out and about.  If you don't want the expense of the hard shell cases, this is a good alternative.",

Anything to take the damage instead of the screen itself.  Well this product is just another one of those protectors.  You get three screen protectors for the price which is nice.  They fit my RC controller perfectly and the air pockets were simple to push out using a plastic card.  The image is clear and screen response is just as accurate as prior to the installation.  The packaging is decent.  Overall, I am happy with this product.  If I had one con, it would be the lack of an instruction sheet, but we've all installed enough of these things by now to figure it out easily enough.",

He loves the ability to set up his own fort and then make adjustments if he wants to add a small room (apparently the ability to make rooms is ideal).<br /><br />It builds a normal style fort and there is more of a cubby that can be made. If there were two sets it would take up our living room but he'd be able to make his fort into more of the house he wants. He loves it as is and likes to put his little foam couch in there and watch shows on a tablet.<br /><br />The pieces are built well and though flexible they do hold up, especially when they tried to use multiple comforters on it and it started to lean.

It took a very long time to arrive and kept seeing delays, needless to say he wanted to use it right out of the box. I knew we'd need to charge it and get fresh batteries into the controller before use. We charged the helicopter and took a test flight in the house (no wind, no other RC's that would cause interference).<br /><br />We tried to start the trimming process which seemed to go ok and took less than a minute. After that things went sideways (almost literally). Without touching the elevation lever, the helicopter shot up and hit the ceiling. I took over control just in case as it was new and I didn't want him to ruin his new toy. I had a feeling there was an issue because I could see the confusion on his face. After I took control I was able to get it to hover for a few seconds and without touching anything else it spun around twice in a circle. I thought that was odd, but it didn't hit the ceiling. My son thought I did something awesome and asked \"how'd you do that\", which I let him know I didn't. I was slowly lower the helicopter back down and it lost transmission and fell to the floor.<br /><br />After that we tried to drain down the battery so we could go for a re-charge and not ruin the lithium ion battery by recharging it too soon. I changed the controller batteries to be safe. Once charged, we ran into the same issues on flight 2.",

Good thing is that we crashed several times but no cosmetic damages (fish tank stand, kitchen table, wall (twice), coffee table, my legs (yes, both).<br /><br />The car was pretty fast but not as fast as I anticipated. That is probably a good thing for my 8 year old as the crashes like meant speed was about right for his first time using this car. His birthday was a few days ago and he's played with it for several minutes each day since then with no need to charge that battery (or use the secondary battery thus far).<br /><br />The battery does say it will need 3 hours to charge though so BE READY to get that second battery on the charger right when you get this car.<br /><br />Overall, very satisfied.

    "text": "I received this as a review sample and spent some quality time with it. When you are actually operating it (i.e., playing) it is truly fun for a few reasons. First, it's simple to control versus some RC toys that require hand/eye coordination. Second, it's practically indestructible, and finally, it works well indoors and will not damage [most] furniture.<br /><br />Where I think this can  be improved is in the battery access and charging functions. Accessing the battery requires a screwdriver (not included)  and accessing the screw that secures the battery compartment is awkward for some adult hands. Moreover, the battery pack is connected to a lock and release electrical connector that is bound to eventually fail over time due to handling and the relatively thin gauge wires. This could be resolved by sealing in the battery pack and using a micro USB charging port.<br /><br />Despite the issue above, there are some nice features: the remote control is one of the better designed ones I have used (and I test a lot of RC toys). It has a hand grip and simplified controls. The realistic, working headlights are a nice feature, and the semi-inflated tires are also functional. For one thing, the tires provide a lot of traction across carpeted floors. This vehicle will even go across patches of grass outdoors, although it's best on concrete and hard surfaces.<br /><br />I did not test the battery life, but gave it an intense twenty minute test drive both indoors and out, and the vehicle responded to every remote control command, including accelerating over uneven surfaces without problems.  It was still going strong when I ended my tests and repackaged it for donation.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is well made and fun - but it could be a lot more fun if recharging it was easier. A final note: when you unpack the box, carefully examine the packaging because there is an antenna, batteries and charger that are easy to overlook and toss by accident.",

    "text": "Comdet's helpful April 7, 2014 review covered the physical aspects of this set, so I will not repeat those. My focus will be on how I use this set.<br /><br />This is [hopefully] the core of a more personalized gift and not the sole way to thank the woman who brought you into the world. For me most of the items are fluff and filler to surround whatever it is that you give her - be it chocolates, jewelry, a bottle of gin or whatever.<br /><br />There is one item included in this set that begs to be personalized and that is the photo frame. No matter what else you slip into the gift bag, the photo you select to place in that frame will probably bring more pleasure than any other gift(s) you decide to include. Choose carefully and wisely and you will make her day more special than you can imagine.<br /><br />If I could change one thing, though, it would be to ditch the fake roses. Unless dear mom has allergies to flowers fake flowers send the wrong message in my opinion. Unless, of course, dear mom likes her wine out of a box, then the ones in this set are a perfect fit.<br /><br />Seriously, this is the start of a mother's day gift, not the gift itself. It's what you add that shows how much you really appreciate the woman who gave you life!",

    "text": "What a perfect size for espresso! These cubes measure 2/3 an inch on each side, which makes them ideal for a two ounce espresso in a demitasse cup. The small size also works beautifully in a six ounce flute of moscato d'Asti.<br /><br />Each box contains one pound of cubes - 198 per box - and each cube is a scant 10 calories and 2 grams of carbs. This is an easy way to measure your calorie and carb intake with coffees and teas.<br /><br />If you tend to put too much sugar in those beverages, you can measure the nutritional impact of your normal usage, then scale back in precise increments. That is something you cannot easily do when measuring out by partial spoons.<br /><br />I'll confess that I prefer [[ASIN:B00716PFYM La Perruche White Sugar Cubes]] when I can afford them, but these are more than adequate and are a sweeter deal (if you will permit me the pun.)",
