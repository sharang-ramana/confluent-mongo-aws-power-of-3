There is an on/off switch but don't think that you will get away with them not turning it back on.

The beginning is too high when it is blown up.  You have to dive onto or over it then you hit the ground hard.  Even worse, it ripped at the seam on the end after about 10 slides.  The anchors are useless because they go after the blown up part.  There were only 2 anchors included.  It needed much more.  The instructions are pretty useless.",

I like it harder because I can actually squish it harder without being afraid of accidentally breaking it, I guess for now I am just confused as to why I get a different product at the store when I buy the exact same brand, just completely different quality, did they change it?",

If the pieces weren't for an entire section, I worried that it would be impossible to put together by only working on a few pieces each day. I've included a picture of what I was able to do after the first box. It comes with a huge poster so you can refer to it while working on it, but I didn't have to use it very much. Since there were only a few pieces to work with, it wasn't overwhelming or too difficult. I only did the 1st box. I am saving the rest of it so I can do this in December.

I've never been much of a Lego builder. Both kids were and my husband was when he was a kid. I think my brother used to have some and I would build houses with them. Well, it took 2 nights to complete it, but we successfully built this train set. Wow! This is quite the Lego set! The instructions were easy to follow, as we expected with Lego. There were some extra pieces if needed. The train power source required a total of 10 AAA batteries.  My husband, who is a tech guy and loves all things nerdy/geeky really enjoyed playing with this train. It works really well. You can control and adjust the speed. We did learn that if you go at maximum speed, it jumps the track.  There are working headlights. It's really a cool set! We had a lot of fun with it. We're still having fun with it because it's still set up on the table.",

This one looks awesome. It's very contemporary looking. It goes pretty fast. The remote control is different from the old one that he had. He has found it to be okay, but it's a little more challenging to make turns than the older style one. It could just be a matter of needing more practice. It is a good quality and not just a child's toy.",

I was afraid everything would be broken and crumbly or that items had gotten mixed up inside.  I was very pleasantly surprised. Everything was in tact and looked great. I got this calendar for my son that I mentioned above. I always get my kids a fun advent countdown calender. I was able to open it from the top and slide the tray out without damaging the perforated doors/windows (or whatever you call the openings). The tray was divided and everything was in its place and looked great. I do not know a lot about rocks and minerals, but from my novice point of view, they are nice. Some are raw, others are polished. There are fossils in addition to the rocks and minerals. The first thing you open is a little magnifying glass and cloth. My son uses a jewelry loupe to examine his collection, but for a new collector, I'm sure what is provided will be useful. The quality of the items seems to be good and comparable to some of the ones that I have purchased for my son in the past.  In order to get the large, cool ones, you have to spend a lot of money! This is actually impressive to receive such a variety of items at this cost. I think my son will have fun opening it.",

There are 12 different Disney Princesses and they all come with 2 outfits. The dolls are wearing one outfit and then there's a separate outfit for the Royal Ball. The dolls are all individually wrapped in tissue paper, as are the spare outfits. I've included a picture. Also, the box is pretty boring and doesn't have any full color photos of what you're getting. So if you're not familiar with this toy set, then you won't know what you have until they're all opened. That could be fun or it could be annoying. Since they're all individually wrapped, it would be great to use for homemade Advent calendars or or party favors.",

Here you basically get the doll and her outfit which includes the Wellie boots, hence the name of the collection. Ashlyn looks like she could be Hispanic or Latin American. Regardless, I am pleased to see some diversity in the collection. She's really cute and seems to be well made. This model is a newer one.

When I saw this, I was intrigued with the ability to tightly close it up without destroying the work in progress. The wooden one will keep the puzzle safe, but you have to find a large place to set it when you're not working on it. So I started a 500 piece puzzle on this board. It's got a fuzzy surface which makes it non-slip. That is good at times, but there are times when I will work on a section of a puzzle and slide it to it's destination. That's difficult to do with this one. Instead of puzzle trays, it has flat fuzzy pieces that you can put the pieces on and move around as needed. With my 500 piece puzzle, I couldn't get all of the pieces spread out flat on the combined boards. I had to have some stacked on top of one another. After I had completed the border, I decided to stop for the evening. I put the puzzle boards on top of the main puzzle area where my work was. Then I closed everything up and made sure the velcro pieces were secure. Then I tilted the whole unit at a 90 degree angle. I heard pieces moving around. My heart sank. The border is always a lot of work! I opened it back up and while the pieces had moved around, it was only the pieces that hadn't been assembled yet. The work area with my completed border was still in tact. I think I will feel better leaving this on a flat surface, such as a table when it's not in use. It does keep the cats from sitting on my work and that's a plus. I always had to cover my work with a towel or something with the wooden tray. This is also weighs less than the wooden one which makes it easier to move. Overall, I am pleased with this puzzle storage piece.",

Unfortunately, more than half of the pieces were missing. It would be an understatement to say we were disappointed. Especially since we were teased by the few pieces that we did receive. I contacted the customer support for the Catan game. They said they couldn't help me and directed me to the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer. They said they couldn't help me either. Our game came with the 19 painted terrain hexes, 6 painted sea frames and 9 painted harbor pieces (I think). We received no cards, no instructions, no dice, no rules booklet, no tokens, no settlements, no roads and possibly more. What we have is unplayable and unusable. And a disappointed family!<br /><br />Update: 10/17: After I posted my original review, I was contacted by the makers of Catan. They apologized for the poor customer service that was given. They also sent me a replacement game for which my family is very appreciative. The game has arrived in its entirety. The game play with the 3D pieces is awesome! It really adds a whole new element to the game. It does take a lot of room to play, more so than the original, but it's really fun to see and feel the pieces. I think it creates a more immersive experience. My 23 year old son has scheduled an upcoming game night with his friends to play this version of the beloved game.",

    "text": "When I saw that there were light kits for some of the Lego kits,  I thought that was a neat idea. Most of the kits, however, were not for Lego sets that my family had. Then I saw the Boba Fett one that my 23 year old son had recently assembled, so I had to order it. It comes with an instruction booklet that shows you step by step with pictures. I assisted my husband with the task. You do have to take parts of the Lego masterpiece apart to do the job. The wires are very thin and once the job is finished, they're not very noticeable. They could have been completely hidden if we had run the first wire along the opposite side of the brick. Lesson learned. By the time we were finished, we were glad to be done and didn't want to go back and change it. The whole thing probably took less than 30 minutes. We were a little slow at times, trying to decipher the instructions to make sure that we were removing the correct piece and such. The actual lights have adhesive strips on them to keep them in place. You do have to plug the wire ends into a piece so everything is linked together. It requires 3 AAA batteries, not included. The end results are great! Our son was very pleased with how it looks.",

It's obviously much easier to find it when it's loudly beeping every few seconds! It becomes more challenging when the volume is softer and the beeps are spaced out more.

I broke it down into 2 separate strands, one \"happy' and then below that \"birthday\" because it was too much for the wide doorway we were hanging them at.

From my playing with them, it seems like there's a pattern of 3 phrases/lines. Figure one says something, then figure two replies, then the first figure says something back. Then just push one of their buttons to keep them talking. There is some repeating of phrases, but never during the three phrases or lines during that button push. Sometimes the characters reply with a logical comeback and others seem totally random. There is usually one line that will call the other figure by name. The figures can be posed.

She has a button on her front side that when pushed, causes her to spew out phrases. Her voice sounds like the movies, so I would assume it's the same actress. If you have another Interactable toy, you put the two so they are facing each other. Then press one of their buttons. They will have a conversation of 3 phrases/lines. They do correctly refer to each other by name. The phrases don't always jive together. For example, Jessie might say something about going to save the critters and then the other Buzz says my name is Buzz Lightyear. Sometimes they do make more sense and sound logical. Regardless, they're fun to play with. They do stand up on their own, but without any stands, they are likely to fall down easily. I am looking forward to more figures coming out!",

It was only on the top/first letter. I've included some pictures. I would have been angry if I had purchased it myself. It comes with thin curling ribbon to string the letters. I chose to make it into one long banner and hung it in the wide entrance to our living room for my son's birthday. It does look festive, even if it is pretty basic.

The figure talks right out of the box, so there's no need to locate batteries before you start playing with it. There is a button on Frozone's chest that you can press to start talking. The voice has to be the real voice of the character.  If you have another figure from the Interactables line, then they will interact with one another. They have to be facing each other to talk. Some of the phrases seem to be perfect responses, but some do not. They do call each other by name  when conversing. I found that when you press one of the figures to activate, the one that was pushed will say a line. Then the other one replies or responds back. Then the original one says one more line. I have tried that with a few different figures and that applies to all of them that I have tried. Just press one of the buttons at the end of the 3rd phrase and they'll continue with another 3 responses. I do wish that the figures came with stands. They can stand up on a table or shelf, but they're not particularly stable and if you bump the surface, they'll fall down. So far I have been having a lot of fun with these! I can't wait until they release some more characters!",

There was no string to hang the numbers, so luckily I had some curling ribbon that did the job. There was also no straw included to help with inflating. I started using one of my own straws for the task, but my husband saw me struggling with that and got out the small power inflator that we used to use with the pool toys and that sped things up. In addition to the number set, there are a few star mylar balloons and some traditional latex ones. (I think they're latex, but I'm not certain). Of those additional balloons, at least 3 of the them did not inflate due to holes. Besides the balloons, there are some spiral pieces for hanging. I did think it was odd that the plastic hanger pieces were not installed and we had to do that ourselves. It was not difficult, but any other time I have had similar swirl/spiral decorations, they've already had the hangers on them. We're staying home for the New Year's celebration, but it is a bit festive having the decorations up. Plus, we're excited to say good bye to 2020!",

This is the first time I have ever considered complaining about the poster, but this poster is not only huge, it's also printed on paperboard so it's stiff and sturdy.

    "text": "Back in the early 2000's, we used to do Murder Mystery Parties with our group of friends. They were kits in boxes where everyone was assigned a character and we followed a loose script to solve the mystery. This is nothing like that. It's an upgraded version for sure. I would describe it as somewhat similar to an escape room experience, but instead of trying to escape, you are solving a murder. There are no characters to assign which is a relief! I hated trying to assign characters without offending people. And the characters were assigned genders so if you didn't have an even number of guys and girls, someone would have to play the opposite. It was never a big deal in my group of friends, but it could be for some.  Here you are the detective and team doing the solving. It comes with all kinds of fun evidence. There's a newspaper clipping that looks like a real newspaper clipping. There's a traffic ticket, photos, and so much more. I was very impressed with the level of creativity that went into it. The old style mystery boxes would have silly clues that didn't look real. This is so much cooler! If you use pencil or write out notes on your paper, you could easily pass this set onto someone else.",

He really enjoyed that and has wanted to continue doing that on the side. He saw this game kit and was super psyched about it! He was taking out all the parts and pieces and I could see the gears turning! While he loved the game he made in class, it was too big and awkward in size. This has a folding game board, cards, dice, and pieces. He's already started a notebook to plan out his new game! This allows kids (and adults) to do something creative! We've talked about how he's going to do the game and he thinks he's going to print out color stickers for the board to make it look professional. He's also going to use fine tip permanent markers.

This is a nice starter set for kids. The set includes pre-mounted wooden stamps, colored pencils, an 2 color ink pad and some outlined stickers of the same stamp images for coloring. The addition of the stickers was a little odd to me, because with the stamps and ink pad, you could basically make your own stickers. The stamps are a good quality. There is excess rubber around the images, so if you aren't careful when stamping, you may get the lines from the edges on your art work. I used to get stamps that had to be assembled, so I always trimmed the rubber around the edges to avoid that. The ink pad is a double one so you can carefully use just one side of the ink pad for a single color or put the rubber into the center and get both colors. There are no papers, cards, etc for stamping on to, so you need to get that. Otherwise, it's a fun activity for kids. My niece is 6 and she had a lot of fun with it.",

The clay is very soft and easy to mold. It doesn't smell like anything. It doesn't make a mess and leave crumbs like Play-Doh. Resealable baggies are included to store the unused/opened clay so it doesn't dry out.

If she was at school in-person, she would have access to base ten blocks in her classroom. At home, she is limited to 2-D illustrations. These base ten blocks are a lot different from the ones that I used to have in my classroom. They are a foam material with magnetic backs. These would be great to use on the white board!! The home classroom that my niece is using has a wall that's painted with magnetic chalk board paint, so these are perfect for her! The blocks do have to be separated which was very easy. My only negative about these, is that the 10 block rod does not exactly match a single row on the 100 block piece. It's not a problem when they're next to each other on the board, but if you wanted to stack them up on one another on a table, they don't match up exactly.

They are fairly sturdy but some of the corners got bent in the process. The stickers are a nice quality. I found it a little difficult to remove them and very difficult to return them to their spots when finished. I may just remove all of the excess from each page of stickers to make it easier for putting them back. One of the pages looked used and had about 5 stickers placed in logical spots on the coordinated background. Had it been accidental, the stickers would have been upside and wouldn't stick, which is what makes me think it was intentional. I found the pages to be colorful and interesting. I did enjoy making my scenes. There are more options per background than you can use at one time, at least in my opinion. I was kind of the \"less is more\" crafter.

They're both in college now, and don't need my help with flash cards. The cards come with 6 rings so you can remove and rearrange the cards as needed.

The pieces are just a tad larger than the ones that I've been working with lately, but not at all as large as ones geared toward children. The pieces are a good thickness and most of them have been an excellent quality. I came across about two that were less than perfect. One had a slightly bent piece and another had the image peeling off its corner. It comes with a zipper style baggie to store the pieces in when you're done, which I love! I am always doing that anyway. It also has a mini poster of the finished poster image. The poster is larger than the box cover, therefore making it easier to use than holding the box, but it is still small. My reading vision has gotten very poor over the last few years and even with my reading glasses on, I had a lot of difficulty deciphering a lot of the details on the poster. The details on the actual puzzle pieces wasn't as challenging. I would definitely consider ordering more puzzles by this company.",

Over the holidays, when the kids were home from college, we started a puzzle on the kitchen table. A couple of days before Christmas, the puzzle still wasn't finished, but since we had guests arriving for the holidays, we had to put the puzzle away. I've tried the rolling mats before, and they do an okay job, but this is just perfect! So now we can just pick up the puzzle tray and relocate it until we can work on it again. There are four drawers to hold the unused pieces. The board is an unfinished pine. It's not fancy at all, but it does the job. And a very good job it does! It comes with a felt mat and an inflatable roll so you can roll it up if you want. This allows us to work on puzzles at  times when we normally wouldn't because we needed the table space.",

I think it would be easier to play (especially with kids) if there were fewer levels. It can be difficult to determine the difference between an intensity level 5 and an intensity level 6. I guess that's a way to keep the tokens from being handed out too quickly. You don't take turns like many games, so it's engaging for all the players which is good when you have children playing.

The items are geared toward a younger market, so I thought this would be something she could experience and share with her 6 year old cousin. The girls had a lot of fun opening this surprise. I like that you know what the big item is before hand. That could be really expensive if you were trying to get a specific animal. Of course, you don't know if you're getting the regular one or the golden one, so there is that element of surprise. The rest of the items are more surprising. The quality of the stuffed animal is nice, but the other items are more party store quality. The experience and fun that the egg unveiling is priceless!",

    "text": "My daughter is 8 years older than her oldest cousin on my side of the family.  We spend a lot of time together, so recently I discovered that the building Lego sets together is something they both like and can do together when the cousins visit. My daughter would have loved this set when she was younger. She had several of the Lego Friends sets and loved horses. Her 10 year old cousin is into the horse stage now, so this set was a big hit for the two girls this past weekend. The set was age appropriate for the 10 year old. It took the two girls an hour or so to complete it. Once it was set up, they spent some time playing with it. My daughter even brought out some of her old Legos to create an even larger play set. The girls spent a good part of the afternoon playing together until my daughter felt that she had to go get on her phone! This is  great set for horse lovers!",

This is probably the most excited I've ever been for a Lego set. The nostalgic feelings that I had for this when I first saw it were practically overwhelming. The Lego Company has done a great job of turning Fred and Wilma and their home into Lego building blocks. The set includes mini figs of Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty. Of course, I would love to have seen a Dino mini fig or Pebbles and Bam Bam, but it's atypical of Lego to include all the characters. The set was pretty easy to build. My 18 year old daughter helped me and we finished in less than an hour. Now I wonder if we could get a Gilligan's Island set next?",

The large balloon inflated all right, but it would not stand up straight. It kept flipping upside down. My husband had to weight it down to get it to stay upright.

Then there's the curvy African American doll, a short, petite doll that looks like she could be Hispanic, and a tall , dark hair doll. The thing I love about them (their differences) is also slightly problematic. They all wear different size clothes/shoes. While, that's pretty normal in the real world, it's more difficult in the Barbie world. Some of the dolls could probably get away with sharing clothes, but curvy doll is out of luck. I hope to see more curvy doll size clothes in the future! And if you are planning to gift this, be aware that they don't come in the typical pink Barbie box. They're mounted on brown cardboard that folds into a box shape. There's no colorful pictures or a plastic window. Other than that, I think this is a wonderful set and has been long needed!",

Now she's in high school, about to graduate, but she still enjoys building with Lego blocks. She has had fun playing with her 5 year old cousin and introducing her to the world of Legos! They recently built this set together when her cousin was visiting. It is age appropriate for the 5 year old. She was able to put it together mostly on her own, with a little help from my daughter. The directions were clear and easy to follow. You can easily add this to some of the other larger Disney princess sets.",

It's a lot like the 20-Q game where you answer a series of yes and no questions then it guess what you're thinking. Most of the time when she played it, it guessed the correct answer. Since my daughter doesn't know a lot about the Pokemon subject, she found that she wasn't able to keep going after a while. We then shared this with my 8 year old nephew. He also has limited Pokemon knowledge. However, he started researching the Pokemon just so he could stump the gadget. He has been having a blast with it! So, I think if you get the right target audience, then it's a good form of entertainment. There is a finite number of Pokemon that you can work with though, thus limiting the game.",

A couple of the pieces broke during the excavating. While they did have a lot of fun in the process, the end result was a little disappointing since they couldn't put the raptor together because of the broken pieces. This is a single use item.

I personally thought that was an ingenious way to do that. Once it was assembled, she was able to control the dino through the app. You can do things like change the color of lights in the eyes, move forward and backward, and more. You write little programs to get it to follow a chain of commands. There are challenges you can do that unlock various behaviors. We loved watching the cats' reactions to it. (They were not fans!). It comes with a USB cable for charging. There's a skin to go over the USB plug that looks like meat. The port to charge the dino is in the mouth, so it looks like you're feeding it meat! Sounds made by the dino go through the app. My daughter has been thoroughly enjoying her raptor. A younger child may need some guidance and assistance, but it's definitely within their ability.

It's for 2 or more players. You keep track of the score on the included score sheets. The question cards are two sided so there are plenty of questions to choose from. Some of the questions are harder than others which only makes the game play a little more challenging. It says that it's for ages 12 and up, but my kids fall into that range and they wouldn't have any fun with it because they don't know a lot of 80's and 90's stuff. However, my peer group is a different story. We were able to take a nice trip down memory lane while playing it.",

    "text": "This is not your Walmart pool float! I am very impressed with how heavy duty it is. When I compared it to a promotional float that my daughter got recently, it's significantly sturdier and thicker than hers. It was easy to inflate with our electric air pump. I really liked the mesh covering on the bottom that keeps you from falling all the way through it. Another thing I really like is the back rest. You have to get yourself in the right position to be comfortable, but once you're there, it's pretty good. And of course the cup holders are a nice feature, too. My daughter and I fought over who got to use this at the pool. I may have to get another one. I definitely think this is a pool type float and would be hesitant to use it on a lake or river, but that's just a personal opinion.",

They really got into the whole &#34;Mr. Game&#34; role and making up rules and such. My son took a game design class last year and he found all the elements of this game to be well crafted. One of the differences between the family group and his friends, is that our family tends to play more cooperative games such as Pandemic, Ticket to Ride, and Settlers of Catan. My son's group of friends are a lot more competitive. Since one group of players really liked it and the other was just &#34;meh&#34;, I split the difference to give it my rating. For the right group, this can be a lot of fun.",

    "text": "My son loved playing with his Thomas train set. He's twenty now,  but we've kept his train set for our nieces and nephew to play with while visiting and for future grandchildren. My 8 year old nephew compared this newly designed Gordon to the original one while visiting us recently. Side by side, this one is a little shorter in length. It moves similarly to the original. One thing that that my nephew said that I thought was particularly interesting was that it looks more like the real Gordon than the older one. As far as working with the older set, he was pleased that it works with the other trains and track without any problems. It comes with adapter track pieces which would be needed if you wanted to combine tracks. We have plenty of original wooden ones, so we probably won't need them, but we did try them out and they worked fine. The new design seems durable. I'm not really sure why the trains were redesigned, but if you are new to the Thomas world I think these are fine. I don't think most kids are going to mind the changes. They are going to see it as a fun toy.",

There is a timer feature built in, so the noise stops after a minute has passed which signals that your turn is over. The headphones don't feel very sturdy, but they are okay. There are 600 cards which have four phrases on each card. We found it difficult to hear the whispering when wearing the headphones, which is desired. If you correctly guess the right phrase, you get to keep the card which is later counted as points. Team with the most points at the end wins. There's instructions for playing with 4 to 8 people as well as for just two. It was funny what some of us thought was being whispered!

There are two cards of each eye color, but one is a left side of the face and the other is the right side. You have to physically pick up the panda board to shake the dice. At first I thought it was like the old classic game Trouble where you press on the dome to get the dice to move, but that's not how it works. After the dice are rolled, you find the two cards in your pile the match what shows up on the panda board. It took one of my students a while before she started &#34;getting&#34; that the left/ride side mattered, but my other student picked up on it fairly quickly. I ended up with a set of cards, too, and I would position it correctly and model it for the one student to copy. The first person to have the correct eye match, wins a tile. We ended up playing three full games. Both kids liked it a lot. Although they are in high school, it was very appropriate for their academic levels.

The instructions weren't too complicated  - actually a little better than some other Mega Construx sets we've had in the past. It's recommended for ages 7 and up, but it is a little difficult for young hands to assemble. My 8 year old niece needed help from my teenagers. It may be more of a lack of experience on her part. The finished product is cute and it does work, though it did require repair work after a few rotations. Overall, it's a cute set.",

It was the same firm type body with fur. This one makes a lot more sound, it's tail moves, and the eyes move. My four year old niece thinks this kitty is the best! It doesn't run from her when she's trying to play with it and it lets her pick it up! There's been a minimal amount of shedding, but that is something the we've seen with other long haired stuffed animals when played with. I do think this is a bit expensive for what it does. Batteries are included, but I don't know how frequently they will need to be replaced. It takes 4 -AAA. Overall, it's cute, but over priced.",

There are only ten games on this emulator. Centipede was the closest to the actual game play in my husband's opinion. Some of the other games were more difficult to play because the joy stick doesn't have the track ball which the original Atari had and many of those games utilize that function. My husband thought the Asteroid game was neat because it was in color where it was originally in black and white. I let my 6 year old nephew play it and he did pretty well with it. I think it helped that he had never played the original and didn't know that the track ball even existed.",

The Barbie Dreamtopia Sweetville Kingdom Carriage just doesn't seem as high quality as the many Barbie products I have purchased over the years. It's definitely not a collector's item. The price is decent and you get a complete set of a doll, unicorn, and carriage. The plastic carriage flexes when you apply pressure. It doesn't feel like it's going to easily break, but it's not as rigid as other Barbie products. The carriage door opens and closes.  The wheels rotate easily and give a pretty smooth ride. The details on the carriage are nice. There are lots of textures to make it more realistic.  The unicorn is a sturdier plastic piece. The doll has the rigid, no bend legs. Her facial details are what you expect on Barbies. She has a removable crown. Her top is molded plastic and not removable. Her skirt is a cute, candy print fabric, but the material itself is stiff and doesn't flow or move. In fact, I don't like the skirt at all. Overall, it's an attractive looking set, but the quality is disappointing. With all that said, I think young Barbie fans would probably still enjoy it.",

At first, I thought that might be a bit off, but after playing it, I agree with that.  It also requires at least 4 people to play, so we had to wait until all four of us were available. Our players were my husband and I, along with our sixteen year old daughter and 19 year old son. The game itself is pretty creative. The instructions were okay, but there were a couple of times when clarification would have been helpful. For example, the first couple of cards we played, one of the teammates read the card. Then we had one card come up that it didn't make sense for anyone on that team to see the card in advance, so we started having the opponents read the cards. The questions and activities were fun. My daughter enjoyed the play-doh activities. I wish it came with a small laminated type card or mat to use with the play-doh. I didn't want to use it directly on our dining room table, so the first time it came up, we used it on a piece of paper. A lot of it stuck to the paper and we couldn't get it off. There are some multiple choice questions, true and false statements, drawing, sculpting, humming, & acting involved. I had to hum Bohemian Rhapsody to my daughter! The game was fun, but a lot more difficult than we expected. Both teams were stuck on the board for a while because of incorrect answers. I think this would be better suited to larger groups or a party setting. Overall, we liked it, but didn't love it.",

You roll the dice and whatever letter comes up is the letter that each word that you write has to start with for that round. You are given a card that tells you what to write. For example, the card may say &#34;a color&#34; for number 1. The die was rolled and it landed on the letter G for that round. So you have to write down a color that starts with G on your list. Now if you and anyone else write the same G word, neither of you get a point. You are trying to come up with the most original and creative word that fits the letter and the subject.

Most of our rounds took about 4 minutes, though one round ended up with just fourteen seconds left when we were done. The game is really quick and slightly chaotic. It got a bit messy in between rounds because we were just throwing the cards down on the table when we played them, but it was pretty fast to sort them back in between rounds because they are color coded. After the first round, my 16 year old daughter was the first one to say how fun she thought it was. That was unexpected because she was the least excited about playing it in the first place.

I remember my mom's old set was chipped in a few places, particularly the notches. These don't look like they will chip at all. The old ones were flat, matte whereas these are sealed and slightly glossy for added protection. I expected the plastic to be light weight and cheap, but it's heavy duty and very comparable to what I remember as a child. The shingles are plastic now instead of wood and so are the animals and figures. There is a nice assortment of pieces. The instruction booklet gives you step by step details on how to build your own cabin as well as pictures of other finished ones. I love that it comes in a metal tin. My mom's old set was a cardboard container that didn't hold up well over the years. It says that this is for ages 3 and up, but I plan to give this to my 6 year old nephew for Christmas.

    "text": "My teenage daughter is obsessed with dinosaurs. She was thrilled to receive this recently. The pastel turquoise color matches her bedroom decor. The dinosaur is super soft. It's monochromatic where as the photos show that the spikes are a contrasting color. If you look at the last picture where the little girl is hugging it, that is more accurate as to what it looks likes in person. The construction is well made and it lives up to the Manhattan Toy name. The feet are weighted with some type of sandy substance so it can stand up better than a lot of stuffed animals. My daughter keeps this dino on her bed, along with her Twenty-One Pilot Pillow. It says it's good for all ages - I don't have any young ones at home, but my 15 year old loves it!",

The case is a hard zippered case. The zipper works well and is sturdy. The dividers flex a bit, but they are pretty strong, too. They attach to the interior of the case with velcro. They can be rearranged in different ways if needed. There is a handle on the top of the case for carrying it. Overall, my son is very pleased with it and for the time being, it holds all of his cards.",

The pieces are a sturdy, light weight wood. They were easy to punch out of their sheets. Overall it was easy to assemble, but there were a few pieces that were more difficult to put in place and they had to be pushed very hard to fit. The paint pots are very small, so you definitely have to paint it in a rainbow style. The paint brush that is included is nothing fancy, but it does the job. It didn't take very long for my daughter to assemble it. The painting is taking longer.

This set of 8 colors allows us to restock the blues, reds, black, browns, and yellows that we go through the most without adding more of the colors we aren't using as quickly. I would buy a box of single colors, such as all blue, if they were packaged that way. As far as the pencils go, Crayola is our go-to brand in the classroom.

Then once a word (trigger word) is given, the first person to come up with the lyrics that uses that words (in a phrase/line of at least 5 words) gets to roll the dice & advance. My 14 year old daughter LOVED the game. Even after our game was finished, she begged us to keep throwing out trigger words for her. She can't wait to play it with her friends. My 17 year old son is not a fan of most family games and although he did play with us, he couldn't wait to finish. He claimed that he didn't know enough songs to play. My husband & I both enjoyed it, though we did find that the 15 second allotment was hard at times. The directions weren't too complicated which was a big plus! There are challenge cards to get if you land on a certain spot. There was one penalty card which you could use if you caught someone on their cell phone! The game is designed for 4-10 players and is relatively short with games lasting about 30 minutes. It was interesting how we would all come up with different songs for each trigger word!<br /><br />*I received the game for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",

The battery charge is about 5 minutes or so, but he says that's pretty normal & he is already looking into extra batteries. The quality of video has been quite acceptable.

We got him 5 Matchbox cars to go with it because the reviews said that they would fit in the elevator, they did. Also he loved sending the cars down the ramps.A car sent from the top will continuing going of it's own power until it gets to the bottom. These were the two reasons I chose the Melissa and Doug.  I also researched the Plan Toys and the Hape garages. Neither of those two allowed a car to go from the top to the bottom on its own. Also, the Plan Toys one had a small elevator and other cars including matchbox cars won't fit. In addition the gas pump was under the garage and looked hard to reach. The Hape garage looked thinner and less sturdy. And it sounded like the elevator was on the small side.  The Melissa and Doug appears very sturdy, I will give an update in a few months to see how it holds up with my grandson and his two siblings playing with it. They are a very rambunctious lot.<br />My only concern was whether or not it would be hard to assemble.. There were a number of reviews complaining of misaligned screw holes, bags of screws missing, etc. I ordered it knowing it would arrive the day of my grandson's birthday, so I took a chance. I guess we got lucky because it arrived with no pieces missing and no defects that would make assembling hard or impossible. My husband said it was not a problem, it took him about a half an hour!

I would suggest if it's windy out to wait until you have a little more stillness in the air. We love these planes! Easy to put together and Have two different flight options. One is straight shooting and the other is Loop de loops. The looping is the most fun so far for the kids and it's the most successful and funnest part of flying for them.",

They make a loud clanking sound when in use. There is another brand similar that is a softer plastic material that I feel for tactile and sensory reasons may be a better alternative for a little fingers to manipulate. This seems slippery and hard to put together for some 4yr olds. They are 90% of what I wanted for them to use but like I said if they were less of a hard plastic and more of a softer material I think they'd be more successful overall. They are a good value and children do tend to use them. Some get frustrated in play when trying to manipulate.",

But let me tell you,  I am so happy I purchased this item. I had my eye on the smaller version but last minute went with this instead. The box arrived with no additional packaging which kind of bummed me out because our postal carriers don't care about packages and thieves look for this kind of thing on porches.  Everything was intact upon delivery.  Opened the box. Easy to follow instructions.  But read them. Go step by step. Its easy but the pieces don't ready come apart easily after assembly. That's my favorite part of this toy! My children cannot pull it apart! The overall construction is very nice. Thick plastic. Easy motion for the moving parts. Sounds are good.  There are a lot of interactive parts and My kids have been enjoying it. Comes with Marshall dog and two pup packs. Also Chase dog, vehicle, and two additional pup packs. Chase's vehicle is NOT like the other pawpatrol vehicles that go with this set. The Chase vehicle doesn't have any moving parts.  The vehicles sold separately all have some special moving part on them.  This does not. My children noticed. Yours will too. Bummer.  Also, my children have a difficult time reaching the periscope with their feet on the floor. They might still be a little young.....  Overall great toy. Entertaining, even to me. Quality.",

    "text": "First thing worth noting is that the rifle will jam if you're not familiar with using it. And if it jams, don't expect to reuse the bullet it got jammed on. But there is a good excuse for this<br /><br />That being, this rifle works a lot like a real bolt action firearm, or at least compared to the pump action rifles which I find are kinda a silly concept as pumping a rifle to get it to fire is very unrealistic.<br /><br />I won't spoil how to use the gun but I can say you have to get a feel for the method of firing it before you can go running around the park like a madman shooting it at random children(EG: not a toy for kids who can't get past the rifle's complexity. get them a gun that works similar to the night finder if they are too young to figure out stuff like this or have low attention spans).<br /><br />Now getting passed getting used to the gun, it's hella entertaining to use. whether you use the stock and fill it with two quick reload clips to give you extra ammo, or you go with the barrel extension and the flip grenade launcher style sight, or if you're a madman like me you go without the stock or the barrel and just go rambo with it using a drum magazine(this is definitely a nerf gun you'll want extensions from other nerf guns on, by the way), you are bound to have hella fun times with it.<br /><br />Just don't put the stock in unless you want to keep it in for a while, as the only way to get it out is too unscrew the back of the gun and lift it out.<br /><br />Now, the down side to the gun is that it has a weak range for a \"sniper,\" which is estimated 25-35 feet, depending on if you use the barrel extension or not. However, a cheap way to bring that up to 30-40 feet is to tape down the unjamming door and air release thingies on the sides of where the clips go with clear household tape. This will give the gun more pressure and make this a very very good mid range rifle. That mixed with the realistic feel of a real rifle, it's definitely worth it for the older, more dedicated nerf fans.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Pros:<br />-Realistic feeling that requires a more professional handing.<br />-Good for customization with other nerf accessories.<br />-Overall quality mid range nerf rifle.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Hard on casual/beginner users and those who have very little respect for the toy (EG not for little kids)<br />-Can really mess with ammo if you jam the gun.<br />-Stock is semi permanent and you're technically not supposed to remove the stock anyways. (Best to decide before you put it in if you want it to have a stock or not)<br />-Shorter range then marketed for. (I wouldn't hold this against the toy itself as everything is over marketed these days. The rifle is for midrange and is meant to be realistic, it's not supposed to be a super sniper that you can running around firing the bullets 70 feet away from you without going into an ark. Not even the Elite rifles do that.)<br /><br />Disclaimer: I do not recommend that the people who buy this product do modifications to the gun that require opening it or removing screws. The only modification I recommended was the one about putting tape over the external holes that lead to where the bullets go, which does not involve any tampering of the hardware internally and hence does not count as an illegal modification. I hope any moderators understand I have no intent of breaking Hasbro or Amazon regulations. Thank you.",

    "text": "This is for ages 3+.  My 9 year old granddaughter is thrilled with it (5 stars for her and her Daddy wasn't allowed to put down his work stuff before she was demonstrating it for him)  There is an 18\" doll rolling suitcase, a very cute Unicorn party dress, already on one of her AG dolls, a comb, brush and hair ties, little fake iPhone and Calculator for the doll. She found the suitcase hard to open until I showed her how to gently lift the latch.  It then fell apart, which required us to mess around to get it back together an usable.  She then didn't get the latch shut right and everything fell out.  We worked on using the latch right.  This is a gifted, mechanically minded, competent 9 year old.  Dress is adorable.  Then there are odd things for the child that she likes but I know she won't really use for the most part.  Like a single rainbow toe separator.  She polishes her toenails, but usually both feet.  A plastic pair of scissors for much younger child.  Some stickers (that's fine) a unicorn stacking pencil she likes but won't use.  She will use the rainbow emory board. All in all, a nice set but be aware parts of it could be disappointing to children over age 4 and then you have an odd hodgepodge useless stuff around that we'd prefer not to add to her play area.",

    "title": "Check the positive battery holder terminals",
    "text": "Like many others I owned the original Radio Shack version of this 130-in-1 electronics kit decades ago.  True, this Elenco version isn't very sturdy.  It's light and flimsy.  But the overall layout, components, and experiments you can wire together are about the same.  The 159-page real paper manual that comes with it is a plus (the PDF is also available for download from Elenco's web site).  Each experiment has an overview, a schematic, and wiring connection-by-numbers instructions.  Many useful and educational analog circuit designs are included (plus one digital gate logic IC).  No microprocessor, computer, smart phone, or software updates required.  Yea!!!<br /><br />OK, now the quality issues.  The first experiments I correctly wired together didn't work at all.  I installed two different sets of 6AA batteries (Amazon Rechargeable then Duracell Alkaline).  Still nothing.  I returned the first one back to Amazon, got a replacement the next day.  Both had the same problem.  Both had a sticker with Date Code 0119.  Hmmmm, manufactured the same day, same problem.  I did some basic troubleshooting to try to figure out the problem.<br /><br />It turns out the design or manufacture of the battery holder is defective.  There is a gap of about 1mm between the + side of each battery and terminals in the holder.  Two small plastic tabs at that location prevented the battery connection from being made.  My \"fix\" was to jam a wadded up piece of copper tape to fill the gap at each of the 6 positive battery terminals to complete the battery circuit (aluminum foil would work fine too). Hopefully Elenco will crack the whip at the Chinese factory to fix this, or they'll see a lot of returns for this very simple and silly defect.  Check recent reviews to see if the problem has been fixed in newer batches from the factory.<br /><br />If you don't have a voltmeter, you can construct a simple circuit to see if power from the batteries is making it to the front panel.  Install the batteries and try lighting up the decimal point of the digital display by connecting: 25-121,24-119 or 25-124,24-122<br /><br />Most of the experiments I've tried so far worked.  But the AM radio receiver circuits are iffy.  The only one I could make work was #113: Two-Transistor Radio.  I used the supplied long green wire raised up high as the antenna.  The signal levels seem too low to work for #112:  Crystal Set Radio and #109:  Operational Amplifier AM Radio.<br /><br />Quality issues aside, I'm keeping it.  I'm having too much fun with it.  And I have great respect for the designers who created the original analog circuits that can be recreated using this kit.",

They are colored with dye with a light urethane finish.<br /><br />I noticed the tops of these are flat whereas the metal ones are not.  So as an experiment, I sanded around the top edge of one, into a curve tapering to a point rather than flat top, thinking this is the way most tops are.  But this didn't work - it would not spin for more than a second after it flipped.  But this actually makes sense.  It needs to have a sheared flat top because the center of gravity (COG) is not straight up and down as it's spinning.  It's the perimeter edge that lines up better with the offset vertical COG when it's inverted.  I sanded it back down flat and it works fine.  I call this one &#34;Stubby.&#34;",

    "text": "Hasbro's done a nice job with the entry into their line of Black Series wearable helmets.  Hasbro addressed some of the criticisms of the Black Series Stormtrooper helmet, which looked nice, but was a difficult fit for some, and the voice electronics weren't very good.<br /><br />In this Poe helmet there are no plastic straps.  Instead there are 3 separable foam cloth-covered stitched pads (2 ear muffs and an upper piece).  The cloth of the pads stick to any of the 7 built-in velcro discs inside the helmet.  It's a tight fit for me with all the pads installed, but if you detach and remove the ear muffs, you'll get about an extra 2 inches of room in width.  So while this helmet looks a bit smaller than the stormtrooper helmet to me, it is actually roomier inside and should fit most adults.  With the ear muffs removed I can even wear the helmet with glasses on.<br /><br />There are three speakers inside the helmet:  two at the front top and one in the back rear.  A recessed microphone is at the inside front left.  The external swing-out mic is just for show, there are no electronics in it.  There is no voice amplification in this one instead your voice simply activates one of a set of pre-recorded sounds that include bb-8, X-Wing and Tie Fighter engine sounds, laser blasts and explosions, that are all mixed together in surround sound.  With no voice activation you'll hear a steady in-flight engine sound.  It all gives you an impression that you're in the middle of a starfighter battle.  And it works pretty well.  You can also trigger sounds by pressing the outside disc on the right side of the helmet.<br /><br />The yellow visor raises up-and-down and has detents to hold it in position.  However, the blast shield above it is fixed.  The paint colors, graphics, and light weathering of the helmet are well done.<br /><br />The outer dimensions of the helmet in inches are approximately 11x9x12 (width, height, depth).",

Compared to the underpowered RC X-Wing, this one has plenty of thrust provided by two tandem counter-rotating motors within the centerline duct.  You can maintain altitude with about 60% thrust.  After a few familiarization flights (and crashes), I was up to 100 feet flying wide circles searching for Rebel ships.  Level flight will requires a rather significant angle-of-attack, and with that pitch up attitude makes it look like it's being pulled along by an invisible string.  The compromise made in this design is a lot of wobble left and right (roll).  The thin rudder is just sufficient to provide controllable flight, though at times it looks more like a bat than a TIE fighter with the wobble  The trim knob does let you adjust the rudder's center position, but the right stick is not proportional, it's 3-position full left rudder, center rudder, and right rudder.  But all-in-all, this is true-to-form TIE Fighter that is flyable and fun out of the box.",

And this is where I deduct a star.  It's quite delicate.  You'll benefit from buying some foam-safe glue (Beacon FOAM TAC is a good one).  The build quality isn't too good; the parts inside aren't very well secured to the body, and I'm having some issues with a sticky elevator servo.  Other annoyances are the battery attachment to the underside with velcro isn't very secure, and the power cable often gets lost inside the body near the propeller housing (tweezers needed to pull it back out.  And as others have noted the method for attaching the front wing with screws is dicey at best; not sure when it's actually holding it in place (when the screws fall out, it isn't).  But aside from these sloppy construction details, I'd still recommend it because it's such a great flyer.  I'm using a Devo 7e transmitter running Deviation 4.0.1 which includes support for the DSM2/DSMX protocol used by the UMX Radian BNF.  No hardware changes needed to the transmitter.<br /><br />11/08/2015 UPDATE:  The sticky elevator servo cause me not to be able to recover from a nosedive and the crash caused the tail section to break almost completely off. I was able to glue it back on but the flight isn't as pure as it was out of the box. I called Horizon Hobby about my issues and they have sent me a replacement UMX Radian free of charge.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:1f2a3c880a660ba73bcdaf865374ae12]] How to set up your Syma X1 before first flight.  I go through the following steps quickly in the video:<br /><br />1) Place a charged LiPo battery into the slide rails on the bottom of the copter, but not all the way in.<br />2) Place the copter in normal top-side-up position on a flat surface.<br />3) THEN push in the copter battery completely.  The red LED in the copter will flash (4 Hz).  Do not move the copter from the flat surface.<br />4) The flashing stops for about 2 seconds.  I believe at this point the initialization of gyroscopes, stabilization algorithms, etc. has completed.  The copter has just learned where \"level\" is for this flight.<br />5) Next the red LED the copter will flash quickly.  If you have not yet bound the copter to the transmitter, the following steps must be completed while the copter is flashing quickly to bind the copter and the transmitter.  If binding has already been completed previously, timing is not important (transmitter can be turned on any time after the fast flashing starts) but the steps are the same to complete the connection between copter and transmitter:<br />  a) Start with transmitter off and the throttle (left stick) all the way down.<br />  b) If you want to switch from Mode 1 to Mode 2 (or from Mode 2 to Mode 1), push the fine tuning switch below the right joystick to the right as you turn on the transmitter.<br />  c) Turn on power to the transmitter.<br />  d) Push the throttle (left stick) all the way up then all the way down.  You will hear a long beep from the transmitter.<br /><br />The binding between the copter and the transmitter performed in step 5 seems to be persistent across copter and transmitter power cycles and battery changes.  The transmitter also maintains Mode and Trim settings across power cycles and battery changes.<br /><br />After step 5 you will know the copter and the transmitter are communicating correctly when lights are on steady (no flashing) on both the copter (red) and on the transmitter (blue).<br /><br />Steps 1-4 must ALWAYS be done before each flight.  If the copter darts off in random directions (especially after performing a level rotation-only maneuver), there's a good chance it's because the gyros weren't initialized properly.  The key is to place the copter on a level surface BEFORE inserting the battery.<br /><br />I've given the Syma X1 4 stars because it's a lot of fun, but 1 star deducted because the instructions are unclear, and in the case of how to set up the copter preflight, just plain wrong.",

However, there are just a couple of minor negatives:  The set is targeted at really young children, and I do not think most of them would have the small motor skills to manipulate such slim pencils and narrow pastels.  The right age is probably about eight.  I also think the set is somewhat overpriced.  You could get each of these items separately (and much more drawing paper) for less money.

You could enjoy this game even if you had no previous knowledge of Star Wars, but it would appeal to you more if you were a SW fan.<br /><br />I always wonder about the educational value of games, but this one, according to my nephew, has no educational value.  There is some strategy involved, so maybe you could say that it sharpens a player's thinking skills.  It is scaled quite small, and I am not sure it is worth the price.  Still, if you like Star Wars, you would definitely have fun with this version of Battleship.",

    "text": "This is an excellent gift for any parent (or other interested adult) who wants to encourage in kids an interest in science in an engaging and fun way.  The \"experiments\" are not difficult, and they do not require too much parental involvement, though you may want to get in on the fun.  They do not require any special equipment that you would not be likely to have around the house, though you will need a number of common household items.  I actually think this is a plus, as you can do the experiments again and again if your child shows interest.  Many kids younger than eight would be interested in these activities, though they may need help reading the instructions.  We are having a hard winter here in northern Ohio, and I think many parents would love this science kit to help keep their children entertained and learning in a fun way on the many \"snow/calamity days\" we have been having.  Directions for the experiments are clear.  I do recommend this product.",

    "text": "I gave this game to my teenage nephew, who played it with several family members and friends.  They found the instructions not really hard, but very long and involved, and it took awhile for them to figure out how to play the game.  They tried to follow the rules, but ended up playing the game according to their own &#34;house rules.&#34;<br /><br />The game comes with a timer, which makes a very loud noise.  They eventually stopped using the timer because the noise was so annoying.  One player even thought that the timer might have been broken.  The timer went off completely on its own, making that obnoxious noise.  Another player, an adult woman, did not enjoy the game at all, but the teens enjoyed the aspect of the game that required you to draw or to describe a product or the logo or symbol for a product.  The game seems to be a combination of Pictionary and Charades and Trivial Pursuit.  The kids thought this was a good, creative game, with a combination of old and new products.  This aspect of the game made it good for mixed age groups.  As other reviewers have said, this game is best played in teams.  I have the feeling that this experiment may have gone better if at least one player had really understood how to play the game so that so much time would not have been consumed in trying to understand the rules.<br /><br />The teens are willing to give this game another try.  I am going to edit this review after they do to see if they enjoyed the game more.  I have a feeling they will, especially as they become more familiar with it.",

The object of the game is for the dog, Shelby, to steal as many bones as possible.  The bones are made of rubber, not plastic, and the dog dishes are sturdy cardboard (which may or may not hold up, given that many pre-schoolers are hard on games and toys.  However, the game is designed to teach counting and simple math skills, and it does this quite well.  Since the dog steals bones from other dishes, the children learn to do simple addition and subtraction.  At the end, children count the number of bones Shelby has stolen, practicing their counting skills in a fun way.  I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fairly sturdy educational game that a pre-schooler will love.  A testimony from Brandon's mom, Laura:  \"I love this game!\"",

He quickly caught on, with the help of older brother Brandon (who is nearly five), how to keep the puppy reading and singing by turning the pages of the book.  In fact, it was Brandon who figured out the toy and taught Joey how to use it completely, a testament to the user-friendliness and age-appropriateness of this toy.  I thought the price might be a little high, but I must say it had provided hours of fun and laughter, as well as a good learning experience for Joey.  I would guess that this would make a good \"from the grandparents\" toy, simply because of the price.  I definitely recommend it--and the batteries are included, something I wish would become industry standard.<br /><br />Update:  After speaking with people who are more accustomed to purchasing toys than I am, I am going to change my opinion of the price.  One person I spoke with said, \"Thirty five bucks?  For a puppy that sings and reads and moves?  That is really reasonable.\"  So I think I may be living in the previous century when it comes to price.  This is a delightful toy, and I think any toddler would love it.",

I recall looking longingly at the 49-count box, and the 64-count box was definitely out of the question.<br /><br />So now, along comes this great box of 152 crayons, and I could not resist.  I am tempted to say that you will find every color known to man in this set of crayons, but I have been to a paint store recently and I know that is not true.  However, I feel safe in saying you will find every color you could ever want.  The classics?  Yes.  Glitter crayons?  Got 'em.  Neon colors?  Yup!  There is even a handy-dandy crayon sharpener in the center of the box.  The plastic cover is a bit flimsy, but that is my only critique.<br /><br />Each summer, a group I belong to collects school supplies for needy children in our area.  We scrutinize \"Back to School\" supply lists, and I note that every single school specifies  a 24-count box of Crayola crayons.  The competing brands are just not acceptable, and I think the teachers are wise to insist on Crayola.  You just cannot go wrong.  Happy artistic endeavors with your new rainbow of color!",

You can play by concentrating on shapes only, on colors only, or on a combination of the two.  The game is fun for kids, and if Brandon is any example, they will like it even if they already have a good grasp of shapes and colors.  Brandon has a younger brother, Joey, who  at 10 months is too young for the game,  but I can see this as a game the two could play together in about a year, with Brandon \"teaching\" Joey all the ins and outs of shapes and colors.

    "text": "When I saw the opportunity to review this Radio Flyer four-in-one tricycle, I was eager to accept:  My cousin and his wife, who live a couple doors down the street, have a three-year-old, and they have just learned that they are expecting another baby in June.  So I knew that this toy would be used in all four of its \"incarnations\" at one point or another.<br /><br />The toy arrived within three days, even though I did not request any special shipping status.<br /><br />The directions for putting the tricycle together are excellent and detailed.  They are entirely pictorial, with no words at all, which is a godsend for those of us who labor for hours trying to read badly translated written instructions.  Laura (the mom) put the entire tricycle together with only minimal help from Brian (the dad).  Brian did have to help with Instruction #13, and also with tightening screws and bolts here and there.  I was delighted to hear that one does not need an engineering degree to put this toy together.<br /><br />The tricycle went together very easily for the most part.  The handlebars are the hardest part of the construction.  Laura recommends that anyone putting this tricycle together pull up on the handlebars after attaching the bars and the clamp to be sure that the clamp has tightened properly.  She pulled up on the handlebars at least four times and was able to remove them despite that clamp being on.  You just have to tighten the clamp as much as possible.<br /><br />This tricycle seems very durable, though I will add to this review after Brandon (the three-year-old) has used the toy more.  The canopy is very nice, and the straps on the seat will be great for the new baby when he or she can use it (at nine months or so).  The cupholder that surrounds the infant in the seat will be great for the baby as well.  My only wish is that the tricycle had rubber tires instead of plastic tires.  We live in a somewhat rural area with no sidewalks, and the plastic tires may not hold up as well as rubber tires.  The push handle, to be used for infants, adjusts to the height of the adult pushing the tricycle, which is a wonderful feature.<br /><br />Now to the acid test:  Does the child like the toy?  Brandon has been off this tricycle only to eat and sleep ever since it was put together.  He even attempted to get on it several times while his mom was putting it together, saying, \"I should try it!\"  With winter coming on he will probably use it only in the house at first, but Brian and Laura have a huge basement, and riding his tricycle there will give him hours of play time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tricycle, especially if your child or children are young enough to take advantage of it in all its formations.  The product description says it can be used from nine months to five years, and that sounds about right.",

The six-year-old liked the toy well enough, but he needed a lot of help in putting some of the projects together.  He loved the flying saucer project and set it off several times in a row.  The 12-year-old, however, was completely entranced.  He opened the box and immediately set about making a doorbell, a radio, a flying saucer, a Morse code program, a trombone, a typewriter, and several other projects--all before the end of his birthday party!.  His sisters, one 14 and the other 12, were also entranced and had to be reminded this was their brother's gift.  I do not recall ever giving a gift that has been this much of an immediate \"hit.\"<br /><br />One thing I wondered about:  Are the kids really learning about electronics, or are they just following the diagrams?  But I think that this approach is similar to the way kids learn a video game or a computer program:  They do not read about it and analyze it; they just do it, and learn in the doing.  If you ask as they are making a project,  \"Can you think of an application for that?\", the learning will be enhanced.<br /><br />I recommend this toy highly, and I am thinking of ordering the Snap Circuits 750 as a gift for all three kids for Christmas.",

The box has a variety of puzzles on the front and I'd prefer it just have the puzzle I'm doing. The back of the puzzle is wood and it is letter coded if you need help sorting, but I did not use this feature. My favorite part is how the pieces lock together really well and almost snap into place. You can pick the whole puzzle up without it breaking at the end.

When you scan an item it tells you how many coins to pay, for example it will say &#34;1 coin&#34; and you put a coin in the slot and it will tell you how many you put in. The only slight drawback is that the money amounts aren't real life, so the age on this is a bit limited since around 6 years old most kids are good with counting actual money and coins.

I don't think it goes as far as it says, maybe only 15 ft, but it is perfect for him.",

But, a child does start playing with it for a little while several times throughout the day even though he doesn't know what he's doing with it. He likes that when he moves around the wand it makes the car go. It's a cool idea with the wand, but I think I would prefer buttons or knobs to press and turn. I think for about $20 there are better toys to spend your money on. He prefers his dump truck that doesn't take batteries and he can push around himself.",

Since the printing was low quality- I still couldn't make out numbers, or exact piece size. Some directions showed pieces not included. Roughly 20+ pieces missing between the two sets. Even with rearranging- I still had to dig in to my personal collection to finish it.  Unless you're an expert builder with a lot of spares and desperately need a train tunnel- avoid this set. I wanted to love it, but the directions were so small that I thought it was a joke. I assumed no seller would seriously send something unreadable.  I was wrong. Beyond the unreadable directions and missing pieces- the design is poorly executed and the roof refuses to stay in place. Due to the bricks being too loose- they just collapsed. Again- had to use my own bricks.",
