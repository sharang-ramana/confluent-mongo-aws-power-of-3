    "text": "I am nearly 14 years old and i've had my share of nerf wars, and trust me, only use the longshot when you have somewhere to duck behind to reload, or have a full clip. The best case scenario for reloading is having a full clip ready to pop in. But when you're not that lucky, you have to load up the clip (which takes awhile,) and then pop it in. That is where it is worse than the firefly, and maverick. It does shoot streamline darts pretty far (over the advertised 30 ft.) but those are the only darts it uses, and the streamline hurt even more in the maverick. The gun also jams a lot. You'll be shooting, you'll reload, push up the bolt, but then it won't click in. Eventually you realize there is already a dart stuck in there somehow. Luckily, NERF addressed this problem and put in a jam door under the tactical rail(handle). But the darts get pretty beat, and it's hard to find refills for the list price. The \"scope' is pretty pathetic, so you should just take that off because if somthings lined up perfectly in it, the dart's bound to go a foot below. The pistol extension is good for sniping, as is the fold-down bipod, but gets in the way otherwise. It is cool to shoot two darts at once, though.<br />Now, finally the good things. This gun is probably the easiest to keep firing within a clip of the ones i've used (i have yet to try the recon cs-6), and is the most accurate. Or, you could hold it like a shotgun and just fire away. And because it is very big (too big with the extension) it is good to shield yourself with. And if you don't have a clip ready, you can slide the dart down the barrel and then cock the gun, although it isn't recommended. So this is a great gun, but i'm not sure if i'd suggest this over the firefly.",

And she was quite excited by all the little trinkets she received.<br />But once all the pieces were opened, I wasn't impressed. The toys feel inexpensive and are quite small. Besides, things like slime and stickers are NOT unique. And there was so much waste. I felt terrible throwing away so much wasted plastic. So I had to remind myself it is about the experience for the kids, and not so much about what was included inside. It really was a fun treat for our daughter, after all.

And they are a juicy, highly pigmented set of children's markers.<br />But I don't understand why the manufacture would make a set that comes with only 85% washable markers for little kids. Don't get me wrong; neon markers are awesome! But Crayola has been making washable neon markers for several decades already.<br />Besides, I think this set is expensive at the current price listed ($19.99). You can get twice as many Crayola markers for this same price here on Amazon.... and Crayola is made in the USA! As a frugal parent, I can not recommend the Arteza set.<br /><br />Hope this review was helpful.",

My 11 year old got bored and frustrated pretty quick. Being that every character has pretty much their own style, its a lot to get going. I'll probably try it again with adult friends and see how it goes before trying to get my kids to play again.<br />The board, cards, and tokens have nice look and feel to them. The player figures have odd marbling to them that I didn't particularly like, but they didn't feel cheap.<br />As others mentioned, the choice of which Villians are included was questionable. I can think of quite a few classic villians that would have been a better choice, but I understand they are trying to keep \"current\" with the new age of Star Wars in Rebels/Mandolorian, etc.<br />So far, I feel like this is a miss that could have been super great",

All of the pieces were accounted for, with a few extras.<br />Again, not Lego, but one of the better off brand experiences I have had so far!",

I am happy to report that he is made out of some very high quality material! And the raptor is far bigger in person than I was expecting, based off of the photos. The only thing I would recommend is having an electronic pump. If you hand to hand-pump this bad boy up, it would take all day! Anyway, this riding dinosaur was an excellent find.

He is truly enthralled by this stacking toy; so I pull it out when I need to 10 unerupted minutes to get the dishes done or some other similar chore. It has kept his attention very well over this last month and I am happy to report the thrill has not worn off.<br />All the pieces are easy to keep clean too. I simply wash them quickly with a little mild dish soap, by hand;  and let them air dry on a towel. My son likes them so much, I will be buying these set for my friends at  future baby shower gifts! This set was a unique and excellent find!",

So she can complete a character in one setting. And this set did not disappoint. She absolutely was thrilled to try all of them.<br />This set comes with everything she needed too.

    "text": "This kit was made to help families like ours. I am a stay at home mom to four kids (11yo and younger). Prior, I was an artist and earned a Special Ed and a Rehabilitation degree. My background has been useful because we ended up a household full of ADHD, severe anxiety, learning and speech disabilities, plus more. We have been using this set for three weeks now and it has proven invaluable. It truly was an excellent find.<br /><br />We do not own the original set (with the Dove on the box), but I suspect this new version is probably an upgraded improvement of the first box set. It looks very similar, except now there appears have some new (maybe better) ideas and slightly more guidance in this new version. I don't mean to imply this set is a duplicate of the first set, nor am I trying to discourage you from buying both. I simply don't know. I came to the conclusion that these were similar after reading the reviews for the first one.  Had I been given the option to chose between the two sets, I would have chosen to start with the newer set I am reviewing here today. Simply because of the changes that were made.<br /><br />ABOUT THE PRODUCT:<br /><br />- Most of the cards appear to have between 200 to 300 words. Each activity lasts about 5 minutes per card, give or take. Of course each could be longer or shorter because you get decide how much time you want to spend.<br /><br />- This newer set has a total of 24 meditation activity cards. 18 of the 24 are guided scenarios. The 18 cards are \"story like, short guided imaginary meditation with different scenes that people can imagine themselves taking a part of.” Meaning they ask you to concentrate and imagine yourself in a particular story line (like \"walking through the woods\" or \"stargazing on  a warm summer night\", for example).<br />- 6 of those 18 cards mentioned above focus on our senses (touch, taste, etc).<br />- In addition to the above 18, there are 6 more \"positive affirmation\" cards. These affirmations address different times of day (morning or bedtime) -or- feelings (anger, stress, etc).<br /><br />OTHER COMPARISON NOTES:<br />- From what I can tell, the original set only appears to have 23 guided imaginary \"walk through the woods\" type scenarios. It does not specifically explore  common human experiences that center around feeling or our body.<br />- The Legend Card is unique to this set. The Legend is more of a guide chart that will help you quickly find the most useful card, depending on the your feelings/needs at the moment­.<br />- Both sets have the same breathing exercise card.<br /><br />MY POSITIVES:<br /><br />- This set is excellent quality. The cards are very nice and are made of a thick paperboard. They are technically laminated, though it wouldn't consider it a plastic waterproof type of covering. It feels more like a wax coating that is water resistant. But it is a sturdy material.<br />-This truly is an activity for all ages. Kids 6 and younger will probably need guidance. Around 6 or 7, this could probably be an independent activity for most kids. But this mediation set is NOT just for kids. I think pre-teens, teens, and even adults can still benefit from these cards. I wish I made more time to use them myself, tbh.<br />- These have been excellent in helping everyone in our house decompress and cope with our daily stressors.<br />- I think this encourages and even teaches how to use our imaginations better (an essential skill!!!).<br />- It has increases our awareness of self worth. And in a sense, these also teach us to take responsibility for some of our thoughts and feelings too. These activities seem to encourage future motivation and action too.<br />-This kit is secular and inclusive. Meaning it is not religions in any way. And Many people are represented in the images. The language the cards use, and the activities are age and gender neutral. The suggested scenarios are something anyone can envision.<br />- And the art is beautiful.<br /><br />THE NEGATIVES:<br />- The box is terrible. It's too small. It's impossible to find the one card the Ledged Guide tells you to grab without taking out the entire stack. And it's a pain putting the cards away. I'm going to have to come up with a better storage system.<br />- There are spelling mistakes, improper punctuation, and unnecessary capitalization. If it had been here or there, I wouldn't have said anything. Nor am I in a position to judge. But it's really bad and does not feel educational.<br />- The price feels a bit steep initially. However, I think if you make it a goal to give this set a real try and use it for a little while, I think you'll see the $30 price tag actually feels like a good deal.<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend trying this. It is unique and I wish I had know about the original set years ago. But I think this  newer set was an even better find. We couldn't be happier. Thank you for reading this ridiculously long review and I hope it helped make your decision easier.",

It is not made with super cheap plastic or ingredients. Most everything you're going to need is included inside the box. And overall, it really engages the kids and keeps their attention. All four of my kids (ages 3 to 11) excitedly hovered around the table the couple of times we pulled this kit out.<br />What I didn't love about it: I don't like how this kit includes two different types of staining dyes (food coloring and neon acrylic paint), so make sure you're kids are wearing play clothes. On a similar note, I didn't like how they used neon paint as one of the dye options to for the lava flow. It simply doesn't work as well. Nor was there enough neon paint included to both experiment with and to paint the mountains. Also, the neon doesn't glow as bright as pictured... mainly because of the tiny amount of paint and the mini light that's included. The flashlight pen is not bright enough to light up the whole volcano, like it shows. Also one of the suggested side projects are just weird. For example, one requires you to have an \"old\" wire brush lying around, that you'd have to be willing to cut up? I don't understand why they didn't include all of the supplies the instructions suggest you'll need.<br />So overy, I think it's a neat kit. My kids have pulled it out three times to use and I suspect they will probably pull it out one more time before it starts collecting dust. I would definitely recommend it if the price is right. I would buy at the $20 post Christmas sale price it is listed for today. At around $30 or more, this set would start to felt pricey to me.<br />Hope this review was helpful.",

    "text": "These v-day planes could have been absolutely great. They're really cute, the value can't be beat and are a excellent alternative to candy. And they fly really great -IF- and only if you put the plastic clip on the nose. My problem with these is instructions aren't included with each plane. They're only printed on the side of the box these planes come in. So I asked six (6!!!) different kids to put each put one together. All six kids were excited by the plane and figured out how to put together this mini puzzle without needing help. But not a single one of them thought to put the plastic clip on the front of the plane. They each threw their planes around a couple of times and then lost interest really quick (because again, the don't work well without the weighted nose part on). So I could see a lot of kids putting these planes together and then ten minutes later a lot of parents throwing them in the trash. And that I think is such a waste, bad for the environment, yada yada. Plus the card itself is boring. It is printed the same on the front and back. So again, these were so close to being perfect. On the positive side, there is enough room to write \"put plastic clip on nose\" on the card.",

Activity tables, in general, have always been a huge hit with all of our babies, but this one is more unique in the sense that it encourages a lot of pounding. Let's be honest, babies have no fine motor skills; so slamming their little puggy fists down on anything is about all they have. And that's ok, because they love it (while strengthening their gross motor skills)! So what I found extra neat about this table has lots of areas that entourages that and will keep their attention. The xylophone part, especially!!!<br />The table itself feels heavy duty and well made. The plastic is very thick and durable; and it will be easy to wipe down and keep clean. The legs are easy to attach too. The only thing I didn't like about this toy had to do with my love/hate relationship with frustration free packaging. I love and prefer it because it's better for the environment... but it isn't very visually gift friendly. Of course I would prefer the recipient to see immediately the awesomeness they just unwrapped, but it's not a deal breaker. Overall though, I think this is the nicest table I've come across yet.",

    "text": "We have five kids in our family, so we've been swimming in Imaginext for nearly a decade. They truly are one of the most high quality and most durable lines out there; and always at the top of my kids most played toys. I have nothing but good things to say about Imaginext. But that doesn't mean every piece they've ever put out has been a hit.<br />And unfortunately, I feel this playset leaves a lot to be desired. It's simply boring. There isn't as much \"surprise\" interaction like with other sets. But the biggest disappointment for us was the crane claw. Now, I understand that it's a replica of a game.... and the claw in real life rarely works, lol. Some of the fun is in loosing. But as a child's toy, the claw needs to work a lot better. Since it doesn't, my kids kinda just ignore this playset, I think.<br />I think Imaginext has released a very similar version of this in the past. I'm hoping it is just an oops with this 2021 release claw error. Because if the claw worked a lot better, I'm certain kids of all ages would absolutely love it.",

At $40 it's a much better value than it looks, I promise.<br />This piece is exceptionally well made too. Our three-year-old absolutely loves Elsa's \"house\". This set has been, by far, one of the most played with toys lately too. Truly. All of our kids have played with it daily for the last two weeks.

At the very least, you need the clear strip to make the arch. And the knotting tool is also a must have in my opinion. It hurts knotting off 200 plus balloons, lol. I have plenty of balloon strips and knotting tools around here, but I doubt most people would have keep this stuff on hand. So if you're in the market for a arch REFILL kit, order this one.

So I am very happy to report that this has not been another big toy taking up valuable space.<br />But I think this is a toy that would be better for older children. My younger ones have trouble transforming him by themselves; which is frustrating to both them, their older siblings and to us (because they then have to interrupt what we're doing to ask us for help).

This achoo doll is very captivating.<br />This doll's features are just to cute too. When her cute little button nose turns pink, even I can barely stand it... my instincts tell me to go fix it, lol. Needless to say, my daughter absolutely loves taking care of her sick baby. It's the diagnosing and healing her baby's ailments with medicine that is very rewarding. Plus, all the accessories that come with a doll are cute too.<br />But what I like the best about the doll is she is inspiring additional pretend play. My daughter has pulled out her doctor kit far more often and is inventing other problems to fix, lol. Over all it's a really cute doll and my daughter is getting her money's worth. I probably wouldn't recommend this for a very young toddler or as a child's first baby doll. The achoo version is little big and clunky in comparison, and doesn't feel like a traditional newborn baby doll. That's not to say that I don't recommend this one because I certainly do. It just feels like a step up from the first round of baby doll to me. But even then, I bet kids who aren't into swaddling and carrying around newborn baby dolls, would still love this because of the interactive features.

It's simply a lot cooler. But, if you're thinking you'll be able to save $100 buying this one over the Replica version, I don't think you'll be happy. While this version feels along the lines of the replica, it is NOT as nice as that one. For example, the plastic used to make this one feels lighter or \"cheaper\" compared to the replica version. And the cute details are missing (like the \"bone\" dice and \"carved\" pieces) aren't included with the one I am reviewing today.

There are all sorts of generic add on slide kits on here (in sets of 50 or 100). They are really cool and the variety will keep them using this microscope for years.

    "text": "Kinetic Sand was always a huge hit for my older children when they were young, so I was really excited to give these to our 4yo. This three pack is too cute and he was thrilled. And of course, my 8 and 11yo were instantly jealous; asking to play along with him while he opened these, lol. They all had a blast and these kept them a lot busier for a lot longer than I expected. I think the dinosaurs would have been difficult for the younger ones to put together themselves, but I didn't hear any complaints because the older kids didn't have a problem.<br />And these digs were not just a lot of fun the first time around! Ours have gotten replay value. They've found other things around the house (like quarters and mini lego sized dudes) to rebury in the sand. They're loving re-surprising one another with new found treasure. And clean up for us is a breeze since I trimmed down an old Amazon box (leaving a one inch lip around all four sides) and have them play with treasure boxes in there. When they're done, I just shake the box out outside. These treasure chests are absolutely adorable and I think they're a good value. I'd buy them again as a gift for their friends or cousins, for sure.<br />Hope this review was helpful.",

This version is easy enough for my older kids to use on their own, and they're really good at helping their younger siblings when they need it here and there (like with replacing the paper).<br />This set has really has gotten a lot of mileage too. We've had it for over a month now and at least one of the kids pulls this out to draw with every other day. I haven't had to change the batteries yet, even though they relentlessly spin their drawings like crazy. And the pens are still nice and juicy after a month too. But my most favorite part about this version is how compact and portable it is.  Clean up is a breeze since all the extra parts fit nicely in the section below. It's really cool.

The photos show a comparison of these two side-by-side (yellow & blue are from this set).<br />With that said, I'm not disappointed. At first, I wasn't sure how this was going to go over with my kids. We naturally tend to think bigger is better, but I was wrong. My kids spend entire days fidgeting with these. No one said anything about them being a smaller size. In fact, I would say my kids played with these more than the bigger ones. And they especially like that they these loop together.<br />Besides, I think the set of tubes is a good value. You get an entire box of smaller ones for not much more that what I've paid for 6 of the larger sized tubes. And these smaller tubes don't seem to crush anywhere near as easily. This type of tube<br />(regardless of size or brand) have to be made out of a thinner plastic to stay flexible.... But that also means they get destroyed so easily. Which is frustrating for how much they cost. The simple fact that these last longer, definitely make some worth a couple extra dollars in my opinion.",

She was very excited when we pull this set out of the Amazon box!<br />Overall, I found the pieces to be pretty well made. The box came damaged, but the pieces inside held up and we're not. Plastic is rather study.<br />I took off a star because I felt the shoes are on a small side. My daughter has wide feet, so I don't think she'll be able to wear them next year. Wide feet aside, I suspect that these shoes would be too small for some 4 or 5-year-olds.<br />But overall it really is a cute set. She was incredibly happy to have it!!!",

The set was bigger than I was expecting, that's for sure.<br />Right from the beginning, she was obsessed with her new baby doll. All of the accessories that came with baby Doc couldn't be cuter either. Her brothers like to pretend play the doll too, which adds an extra layer of sweetness. That's when they're allowed to anyway. Our daughter carries this doll just every where it seems, lol.  And I've seen her playing with the accessories at least once a day too. She really is having a good time and absolutely loves this baby.<br />Plus I found the doll and her accessories to be nice quality. Overall the doll feels well made. The plastic used in this set feels thick and heavy duty. We just love her. It was a very nice set. Absolutely no regrets!<br />Hope this review was helpful!!!",

When comparing those Disney Store costumes to this little mermaid one, I'm sorry to say the exceptional quality is just not here.

Which honestly at this price is what I would expect this type of quality and construction.

And they even turned out bigger than I had anticipated. I did have to help a little here and there, but for the most part they were able to do this project themselves.

There is barely any scent in these two sticks; and none of the other chalk are scented from what I can tell. The chalk holders don't work well, as the chalk sticks easily fall out of the holders.<br />The spray chalk was a temporary hit with my kids; but that only lasted about 20 minutes. Plus the instructions show measuring the powder out with a cup that isn't included. And it was a bit messy getting the powder in the spray bottle. Eventually my kids started filling the water bottle with plain water and had more fun spraying things (like each other) with it instead of using the spray chalk.

One little tray of paint and three crayons, basically. I would expect this set to be closer to a $10 kit online; but also is a product that I would expect to find at the store Five Below (it's a dollar store where everything is $5 or less).

They are beautiful in design, dark grey steel color with dark green accents.<br />This is the first time I have seen hollow metal dice. I was concerned that they wouldn't be sturdy enough, and I would have to be worried about crushing/deforming them, but its not the case! They are very light but strong!<br />And of course, most importantly, they roll very nicely. They seem to be true weighed, and make a pleasant metallic noise when tumbling.<br />LOVE THESE DICE!",

Everything you need comes in the box; including extra threaders (the red plastic with the wire diamond coming out one end). Honestly, having a threader on hand can make or break a sewing experience! They're incredibly cheap (a dollar at the box store), but unless you've been around someone who sowed by hand, most people don't know this game changing product exists! And No other kid kit has ever included one before!!!! So incredibly thoughtful. In my opinion, the treader is truly the one piece that needs to be included in with any hand sewing project kit, if a manufacturer is going to market their product as something children can do independently!<br />My 7-year-old was able to do the vast majority of these without any help and followed the instructions with ease. This set kept her busy all weekend. She opened the box after school on a Friday and had all of them done by Sunday night. Plus her hand and I coordination has improved so much since she's taken up sewing. I can't recommend is enough!!!",

I can't tell you how excited she was she opened the amazon box!<br />Now that we've gotten to play with a couple of the dolls in person, they are as neat as they are on the show.

She is also a huge animal lover, so her favorite part is the pets that come with each doll.<br />I think these dolls are a really good value, considering the accessories that are included.

Between the button smashing and the laughing and screaming from playing, this is a loud game haha.<br />The hammer is quite light, so it there is no real threat of any \"smashing\" going on, but it is still fun. With how hard my kids were going at it, I am not sure if it will hold up that long, the construction seems to be a little on the flimsy side. At this point, 4 stars is about right.

They've pulled it down off the shelf and played with it every day since receiving it. I'd say their favorite part is turning off all the lights in their room and looking at the planets that they can light up on the ceiling.

We're all so happy that we picked this up.<br />These blocks sit with him on his school desk at home. All day long, he is constantly fidgeting with them. Sorting them by color, stacking them, making little things, etc. It's extra impressive because his desk is surrounded with a ton of legos, which used to be his favorite school time fidget toy. I think he like these better, being simpler type of stacking block. He can still fidget stack without getting too distracted. His teacher said on chat today she has noticed his focus has sharpened as well over this last two weeks.<br />This block set is also great for math lessons, as they're originally intended, lol. I have borrowed them from him time to time to use with my 1st grader; to help her visually with math as well.  Highly recommended... Great STEM<br /> Toy in my opinion.",

She's already cycles between the other sets constantly, so this Fantastic Flowers set was the perfect addition and mixed things up a bit!!!<br />The press is is easy to use enough for her to use on her own and she is so proud of her creations. We'll run out of the pretty paper that comes with it eventually, but I have plenty of cardstock and scrap booking paper on hand for when that happens. I'm not going to lie, I even have fun creating flowers with her. While the Kahootz fashion plates are a fun, retro throwback that pulls on my childhood heartstrings, this floral set might secretly be my favorite set of theirs yet!!! Great job and thank you Kahootz!",

They're on the pricey side, but I happily buy them because I believe the value is there. And this new massive Batcave is no exception!<br />I can not tell you how excited my kids were when I pulled this out the Amazon box! They've had it for a couple of weeks now and have played with it nearly every day. It comes with a lot of extra figures and accessories that help keep the imaginary play going for hours. Not to mention the lights and sounds are awesome! (they sounds aren't too loud or annoying on the lower setting, btw). The bad guys talking is by far my boys favorite part. And did I mention this playset is huge??? Two kids can easily play with it at one time!<br />I can't imagine one bad thing to say about it. I suppose if I had to say anything, the only negative experience we had was right away but still our own fault. It needs four C batteries (which we didn't have when on hand when it arrived) and took us about 20 minutes to take it out of the box and put the whole thing together. I'd highly recommend setting it up before you show your kids it or they just linger around behind you whining every 30 seconds about why you're taking so long to put it together, lol! But beyond that, any kid would be thrilled to have this. It really is one of the coolest playsets (if not the absolute best one) that I have ever seen!

That seems like a lot for a toy these days.<br />This set came with a lot of pieces and took longer to assemble than most Hot Wheels sets we've owned. However, once assembled, it's quite sturdy! We already have hundreds of hot wheels, tracks, and sets; so this was an awesome addition! Everyone here would recommend it!!! It would make a a pretty sweet gift!",

    "text": "Our oldest is all about Treasure X this year, so this toy couldn't have been more perfect for him! It kept him busy for hours!!!<br />I'm not going to lie, I found the gutting of the shark a little morbid with this one.... but he's just a kid and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Once he had retrieved all the pieces, it was easy enough for him to put together on his own. The instructions were easy enough for him to read and follow on his own.<br />This shark toy is made of decent quality plastic and the slime isn't too sticky. I appreciate that Treasure X \"exploration\" toys aren't nearly as messy as many of the other \"exploration/dig\" we've owned that were made by other toys makers. In addition, I'd consider it a really good value, seeing as how it kept him busy for hours. It's not a \"one and done\" toy either.... he's still playing with the shark and his alien skeleton guy days after he was done finding the pieces. I can not imagine any kid not absolutely loving this!!! (His 6yo sister was very jealous that her brother got this, btw). I'm excited to buy my kids more Treasure X this coming Xmas. Highly recommended!!!",

    "text": "*UPDATED APRIL OF 2022*<br />Guys, these markers really last! I'm coming back to buy her a second set for her birthday only because she has lost or misplaced so many in the last year and a half (not really her fault, our new puppy loved to chew up her things). She has continued to draw nearly every day; and of the Bic markers she still has, they are all still super juicy and drawing beautifully. She still loves them so much, she absolutely refuses to let them be mixed with her crayola markers! They really are fantastic quality.<br /><br />*ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />My daughter really likes these markers! She's an artist and draws pictures every day. These are going to be perfect for her because I can't even tell you how many sets of crayola markets we have gone through in the last five years.<br />A HUGE part of the reason why we have gone through so many markers is because my daughter loves to lose both the markers themselves and their caps. I feel terrible talking bad about my daughter, but it is truly mind boggling how good she is at loosing both. I find parts of markers throughout the house constantly. In and under: the couch, her bed, through the kitchen and even in our cars. She lives for drawing and her markers.  My daughter is the *perfect* test subject for these and I will be back in about 90 days with an update to see if these last.<br />So far I'm excited for these though. The ink is bright and the colors very pretty.  And I love the solid color of the plastic tube; it makes the color easily identifiable. I also appreciate that this set comes with two of every color, because as I stated above, she loses markers constantly. The only thing I didn't love was the packaging. The cardboard was weak and came unusable from being sent in a padded envelope.  Not a deal breaker for us though since all her markers go right into art storage bins.  So far, I'm really excited to recommend these!!!",

Her hand-eye coordination isn't developed enough yet to push 75+ pins in place, so I ended up having to do most of that step for her.  I also had to help her with keeping the string taunt. But with that said, I had a heck of lot fun doing it with her. She's never done string art before and I haven't in years, and we both really enjoyed doing the turtle together (we'll save the flower for later). She was so proud of it once we were finished.<br />So yeah, I would recommend this set. It's good quality and comes with plenty of extra supplies (like enough string). And seeing as how it took it us well over an hour to do, I think it's a good value. And that's important to me, because I can't tell you how many times I've spent $10 or $15 on an art kit just for her to finish in a matter of minutes.

Especially my 6yo.<br />This video camera is really easy for them to use... they had all the features memorized in a few days. The green screen is really neat too. It was a big hit for a few days... especially the dinosaur chasing scene. But I will say the green screen features thrill wore off a little sooner than I would have expected. They haven't played with the different background scenes in over a week now and the games since the first day. But kids ebb and flow, I'm sure they'll go back to it in the future. But for now, my daughter is having plenty of fun making her own videos. She absolutely loves rewatching her videos over and over.<br />The battery life is pretty good on this and it charges pretty quickly. The storage however is not very big. We have plenty of extra SD cards around the house, so it wasn't a problem for us. But just know, you'll most likely want to pick an extra one up. I also think the picture quality is pretty good now. We have the blue vtech camera that we got about 6 years old, and you the updated technology is so much better now.<br />I guess the only things I have bad to say about this is I wish the green screen was a little bigger. It gets a little crowded when two kids are trying to fit on the screen. And I have a love/hate relationship with the uploading option. I have to manually hook it up to my computer via usb cord to upload to the internet. On one hand, this feels \"old school\" and is time consuming... but on the other, at least I can monitor and limit everything my kids want to upload to their (locked and private) youtube channel.  If my daughter had her way, upload two dozen videos a day!<br />Anyway, I can't recommend this toy video camera enough. I'm certain any child that has expressed interest in creating their own youtube videos will LOVE this! It really is that awesome. Thank you VTech!!!",

And we've accumulated so many Pokie toys, we honestly don't have room for any more. So I personally appreciate how compacted this toy is... and love even more that it also storage item and makes for a quick & easy clean up! I can toss dozens of his mini pokie figurines right into the bag, zip it up and the mess is gone! Plus it's like a back pack, so it's easy to hang on one of the various hooks around his room!<br />The extra bonus is this playset is portable. My son took it too his grandparents house this past weekend so his cousins (of the same age) could play with it too. My niece and nephew were so overwhelming jealous, I'm going to be buy them one for Christmas.<br />We honestly can't recommend this playset enough! I don't know a single pokie fan who wouldn't love it! It's well made and a ton of fun!!!!",

    "text": "I think this kit is just \"ok\". My 6yo was far more impressed than I was.<br />My main problem with this kit is that there is no way anyone could string these beads. All thread included is far to thick for the tiny bead holes. My daughter was excited to use a real needle for the first time though. Pictured next to the needed is a needle threader (threaders can be picked up for $1 at your local box if they still have a sewing dept).<br />The string she used to make her bead bracelet was silky smooth. It made the beading process easier... but the bracelet broke three minutes after she finished. I triple knotting it off too and that wasn't strong enough to keep the knot together. I'd recommend dotting the knot with a drop of glue or clear nail polish to make it hold.<br />In addition, I think this kit is divided in half; made for two different age groups. Younger children who would be interested in beading part probably won't be ready for friendship braclet weaving for a few more years. And just the same, I think older girls might find the beading process too juvenile. So if your looking for a friendship bracelet kit, I don't see a lot of value in this kit.<br />These is also a lot of excess packaging to make what you get seem bigger than it is. I feel like this is something that I would have pick up at five below, so $13 feels overpriced to me.<br />(My daughter wanted to use her own round letter beads; but she could have used the square letter beads that came in this kit just the same)",

    "text": "I can't in good conscience recommend this product. It's nothing more than a box of plastic beakers. The kit doesn't come with a single ingredient needed to make any of the projects happen. If I ran to my local box store right now to pick up all that is needed, I could easily drop another $30 plus dollars for everything. Granted I bet you could pick up half the items at the dollar store and save a few bucks, but then your making a second stop. In addition, it's 2020. Who realistically has those batteries on hand anymore... So that's another $5.<br />Unfortunately, my kids haven't gotten to try this kit yet. I made the mistake (after quickly reading the back of the box), and agreed to let my kids do one of the projects after dinner last night. I saw the checklist and figured surly we had enough of the ingredients on hand to do at least one project in this kit. Nope. Not a single one. Even the basic slime recipe was altered to calls for a b vitamins!<br />So I definitely would not consider this item giftable. Especially this year. It requires far to many extras and make assumptions the recipient will have access to all of those ingredients. At the same time. It looks like we'll be dealing with Covid through the Xmas season and I'm not interested in making extra unnecessary trips to the store. Not to mention, we live up north. Our local stores having been out of stock on so many items and USPS is taking two plus weeks to deliver items. This kit couldn't have been released at a worst time, in my opinion.<br />Normally we love Learning Resources. They're a great company. I don't know what happened here.",

These wax art sticks couldn't be more perfect!!!<br />They really do inspire imagination and creativity.

    "text": "What an adorable craft set! We're heading into fall off 2020, and our kids school are remaining virtual (physically closed) due to Covid. It's been long six months and I'm desperate for new projects. This set was perfect!<br />Right out of the box, our 6yo was enthralled! The instructions are easy for her to follow and she insisted on doing almost the entire first vase herself. I forgot to look at the clock, but the first vase took her a quite a while to complete. Which was great...  it drives me nuts when art kits cost $10+ and your kid is done with in 15 minutes. I also liked that this set was unique and unlike any other art kit we've had in the past.<br />The first vase she put together turned out really cute. She's super excited to give it to her grandma the next time we see her. My 6yo and I can't recommend this art project enough!!!",

I'm so happy to see other companies making compatible and affordable AG sets like this!<br />This playset comes with a decent amount of cute matching accessories! The only thing I wish was it came with a few more hangers. My daughter loves putting away clothes on the bar and in the dresser the most.... and she can fit more than four outfits on the clothes bar.<br />I considered this set was well made. The quality is on par with Target's \"Our Generation\" line and I would consider it slightly nicer than Walmart's \"My Life\".  This set would make an excellent birthday or holiday present. Just check the measurements because this is a big playset! Both my 6yo and I would highly recommend it!!!",

It's been 5 months of lockdown and I am desperate for some new art and stem entertainment!<br />So this kit was perfect. My 6yo has never sown before.... but took to this like a fish to water! It was very easy to set her up with and in a few moments she had already gotten the hang of it. The animals are adorable and the perfect size. It's going to take her several hours to complete all four animals, so you really do get your money's worth out of this kit! I can't think of a negative thing to say. I can't recommend it enough!!!!",

I can't wait to make our own personalized board game!!!!<br />As intended, the kit itself is very plain, lol. Almost everything here is completely customizable. The cardboard used to make the box and the board is quite thick. I expect it to take an art medium that is low in moisture (like acrylic paint or an alcoholic marker) without buckling much at all. For a novice, I would probably recommend sticking to a more user friendly medium like Sharpie permanent markers (they come in 30 different colors now)! And don't forget, all artists make mistakes. I will make many creating this project; and I plan to cover those mistakes by building up thin layers of white acrylic paint.... Like white out!<br />I can't think of a single bad thing to say. It's an awesome idea.... And this would make a super unique gift!!!! The possibilities are endless.",

    "text": "We had the original Botley on our wishlist for a long time; but the reviews on the 1st version said it had some minor limitions. It looks like the manufacturer listened and made all the right improvements to 2.0!<br />Our kids are 6 & 9. At the time of this review, our schools just announced they'll remain closed this fall due to Covid. I'm not a great teacher and am desperately looking for STEM activities that are actually fun. And now that he is here, Botley 2.0 really fits the bill!!!<br />Right out of the package, my 9yo found this almost too easy. Which was great because he was able to supervise his 6yo sister. She didn't need assistance, but more a little encouragement here and there.<br />They both love video games, so they had Botley's remote down in just a few minutes.<br />Botley himself is really well built. The plastic feels thick and good quality.... I don't think I'll have to worry about my kids busting him repeatedly running him into the wall. And did I mention that she's adorable!<br />But leave it to my kids to not use a toy as intended.... They're having a blast setting up Lego towers to knock down or chasing each other's toys down playing \"cops and robbers\" with the police siren function whaling, among other things.<br />The only thing both my kids found  boring were the extra pieces that came with it. For example, they didn't find the black line puzzle all that impressive and just wanted to go back to playing him with toys they have around the house. Which is great, I love that Botley even revived their interest in old toys (which after 5 months of lockdown, that's incredibly impressive).<br />There is so much opportunity for creative thinking and learning with him.... We just love Botley 2.0. He's been so much fun!!!!",

Like many parents, I struggled a lot as \"the teacher\" when they closed last spring and I am now desperate to keep that from happening again. I'm looking for anything to keep us all entertained and excited to learn this fall. This totally fits the bill!! Our kids will be entering 1st and 4th grade and I LOVE that this is something that is age appropriate for both to do at the same time!!!<br />The kit came complete and the instructions were easy enough to understand. I believe we had everything around the house that didn't come with the kit. I did struggle to find a plain paperclip laying around the house though, lol.<br />The only thing I have half bad to say about it is the packaging it came in. If you were planning on giving this as a gift to a kid outside of your home, this \"looks\" very boring in a brown cardboard box. But if I was giving it to my own kids, we'll then I love the eco-friendly packaging. Like normal kids, mine demand to open all things immediately anyway. They can wait an extra 30 seconds to see what excitement comes in the box. My point is, a lot of toys come in both packaging options these days. Just make sure you're purchasing the one that best fits your gift giving needs.<br /><br />Just like all the other National Geographic toys and science kits we've had over the years, this one is every bit as high quality. Can't recommend National Geographic enough!!!!",

My daughter anything that lights up, so the lanterns were the perfect project for her.<br />I liked that this kit comes with three shatter-proof, plastic lanterns! Doing one now and two later gives us time to come up with new ideas. For example, our daughter found some beautiful glitter and  little feathers in our massive art bin which she already has set aside for the next fairy jar we construct.  I'm excited for her!",

    "text": "Much like a lot of you experienced, our schools have been closed since mid-march due to Covid. It's been 5 months at the time of this review. And we've noticed lately our 6 year old has forgotten alot of her kindergarten sight words. She's also not a huge fan of reading books, as she gets bored easily. So I ordered this game, hoping it would bring the fun back into re-learning old information.<br />And it really did help! My daughter has excitedly asked to play every night since this game arrived. I also like how the blue tray is just the right size so I can use basic note cards to write out words that are not included (especially as she's learning new words in the future).<br />At this time, I'm struggling to find anything negative to say about this educational toy! Maybe it would be that it doesn't come with long term storage; but I was able to upcycled the perfect sized container here at home to keep it all together. So really, that wasn't a big problem.<br />I can't recommend you pick up this game enough!!!",

They really do keep him out of \"trouble\". We're serious fidget horders too; we have two overflowing \"junk\" drawers dedicated just to fidgets... So I'm boggled I've never come across these before.<br />Anyway, it was our 6yo who fell hardest in love with these magnet fidgets. She's had a firm grip on them for the last three hours, lol. I think they're going to get a lot of use!<br />The only thing I didn't love about them is the metal gift box came a little dented and some of the chrome appears rubbed off on the magnets themselves. I'm guessing the later happens during the coating process at the factory and it just is how these magnets turn out. The minor infractions are not a deal breaker, especially at this price in my opinion.<br />I can't recommend these enough!!!",

And believe me, if a toy has a weak spot, my children will find it. And break it. Every time.<br />Also know th instructions and warnings only look overwhelmimg at first; but in the end were easy enough to navigate and understand. In reality, it's only about a dozen sentences printed in 18 different languages (both in the manual and in the outside). So it only looks like a lot of text at first. It took less than 5 minutes to open her and figure things out.<br />The only thing I'm not loving so far is the power supply cord. I'm not a fan of any item that comes with its own, uncommon charging device (because if the power supply gets lost or broken, now so is the toy). And it's really short cord, which limited the places around the house we could plug her in to. And as much as my daughter wanted to do it by herself, she was unable to wrap the cord back into it's spot in the bottom of the base.<br />Beyond the minor cord issues, I can't recommend this toy enough. Don't forget to keep her away from a lit fireplace though, lol.",

But other times she's intently focused on the parts she can take apart and put back together (like the sliding latch in the middle or the clip on the far right).<br />She also enjoys bringing the bored over to her dad or I so she can order us to repeatedly untie and retie the laces. It's incredibly interactive!<br />The wood is very thick and heavy, and it is incredibly well made. Can't recommend this activity bored enough!",

They organs are already picking up cat hair, glitter, etc.  I also agree it is a pain to put back together.  I expected the kids to have trouble, but was surprised it was difficult for me (I took a year of anatomy in college and had a similar toy model to this as a child).<br />CONCLUSION: If I were buying it again, I'd search for one with all hard plastic organs.

His kit came with 10 paint colors and 2 packages of plaster - enough for two rounds of dinos.  Hers contained half of that; 1 plaster package and 5 colors of the same size.  It wasn't a mistake;  it's printed in the instructions that the boys kits intentionally come with more!  It really sucked having to explain, apologize and then make this right for my daughter.  So off to the hardware store, where I spent another $10 on a massive bucket of plaster so she could do it a second time with him.<br />Had I not had the dino kit to compare, I still would have been disappointed.

We kept two wands and sent one home with a friend. I don't know how theirs held up.  But of the two we kept, one broke within a day.  Duct tape fixed it for a short time, but eventually, the handle fell apart.  The other one we kept is still working 10 months later.  That poor thing has enduring endless hours of kid abuse.  Faught over constantly and dropped a thousand times.  And the last one has held up.  Batteries last a long time between changes too.<br />Lost a second star because they are a bit too loud.  The sound they make is really annoying.  And the LED flashing lights are a bit too bright.  The kids might love them, but gosh are these wands are terrible. I can live with them for how happy these make the kids.  I still think they're worth it.  I even came back to buy more for this summer.  Amazon is out of stock, so my husband is the only one happy at the moment.  He absolutely hates these wands.  He a pretty laid back guy too.  Rarely complains.  Not usually sensitive to noises and lights.  But there is just something about these that irritated him extra bad.  I could see them bothering a sensitive family member or the family pets.",

As far as the regular sized bubbles, I felt this mix only had a slight edge of Gazillion... if any.<br /><br />For me, the cost savings of this DIY mix wasn't as important.  It is a nice bonus of course.  But I was more concerned about the inconvenience of having to make it and the possibility of me forgetting to make this mix up ahead of time.  But because it brings my kids so much joy and I am really happy with this product, I think it will continue to be a pleasure to make this mix for them in the future.<br /><br />We tested this BubbleThing mix and the pre-made Gazillion bubble solution  three times each.  We used two wands.  The Gazillion &#34;Incredibubble&#34; Wand (one BIG circle, about the size of a dinner plate) -AND- the &#34;Incredibubble Multiple Bubble Wand&#34;  (which has dozens of hoops spread like peacock feathers).  Both wands incredibly awesome, but they use tons and tons of bubble solution.  Like12 oz per outing for just two kids!  So Gazillion could add up quickly if your kids are bubbleaholics like mine are.",

    "text": "Like other moms have said, the \"TODDLER\" size is truly a size 2T.  Their sizing chart says it fits toddlers \"35-39\" inches tall.  I measured him to be 36\" on the dot the day we ordered it in mid-September... and when it showed up two days later, it was far to small.  Practically cutting into his shoulders and his neck.  So glad I sent it back because he grew another inch by Halloween.<br /><br />So at 37\" tall, their size \"small\" was WAY to big.  He wears size 3T in everything right now, so I wouldn't recommend the size small for 3T kids UNLESS you or someone you know can sew!  The middle section from the shoulders to crotch was a decent fit, length wise anyway.  Everywhere else it was super baggy and there is still a ton of extra fabric around the torso area... which I figured would be ok, because I expected to layer clothes underneath (we're in Wisconsin and Halloween is notoriously cold here).  The head gear was a little loose, but an ok fit overall.  BUT, I had to have my mom hem up the legs a full 3 inches and stitch two of the spikes down the back together so his tail wasn't dragging on the ground.<br /><br />We decided to keep the small and not try to find something else because the hubby really wanted him to be  dinosaur this year.  Overall, I would say the quality of the costume was much better than the similarly priced costumes I saw at Walmart or Target.  The material is thinner, but not super thin like most costumes are.  It is cuter in person and we got lots and lots of complements even with it being exceptionally baggy.  I'll upload a pic so you all can see what a size small looks like on a size 3T boy who is 37\" tall and 33ish lbs.",

This actual product does a good job of keeping the pieces together and cuts down toddler frustration.  But the bands are thick and hard to manipulate.  They're impossible to get back off and equally as impossible for a young child to use.  They don't give you the \"floating through the air\" kind of track support as pictured, but they do a great job of keeping pieces that get bumped out of place easily.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE #1: Your local dollar store sells little mini hair ties (for use one little girls hair... they're a little smaller than the size of a dime).  I picked up 500 clear bands for a dollar!!!!  Sure, I have to twist two or three around instead of one.  But I actually prefer them to the Snug Trac because they are easily to twist around the ends, they're easy to take back off and I can layer them on depending on how much support I need.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE #2:  We also bought the \"Suretrack\" track supports, which are able to provide the \"floating through the air\" type track set ups.<br /><br />So yeah, I'd recommend the dollar store ties and the Suretrack set and NOT these overpriced rubber bands.",

It came out of the box with quite a few scratches to artwork.  We have a lot of M&D products and I feel their quality control has been lacking in the recent years.

I've bought a dozen or so M&D toys this year, and so far have been pretty disappointed in their quality control.  So this set was a nice change.<br /><br />The other nice surprise was that they all fit back in the box.  When I first took it out of the amazon cardboard box, my husband said to me \"there is no way we are ever getting those blocks back in there\".  But the size/dimensions of all the pieces were very well thought out and it is surprisingly easy to get them all back in the box in no particular order.  So yay, finally got a M&D product worth the over inflated cost :-)<br /><br />(Also wanted to mention that I got lucky and only paid $35!  It was on sale for $40 before xmas with another $5 discount for spending over $30 on a M&D product.  Amazon has a M&D sale on about twice a year... and while not everything is included, many of there popular items are.  I watch savings blogs on facebook to find these deals)",

    "text": "We have had no problem with any of the tracks staying up.  However, this particular add on is fairly unimpressive (especially for the price tag).<br /><br />I was worried about this particular add on, but soon proven wrong by our 24 month old because he actually remembers to close the trap door after each trip down the ramp.<br /><br />But still, this add on doesn't do much and is kind of lame.<br /><br />Also slightly frustrating, the hot wheel car that came with this add-on had a busted wheel and gets stuck on the other wall track ramps we have.  Not a huge biggie, because as the Mattel customer service rep pointed out, you don't HAVE to use the cars designed specifically for this set.  However, the Wall Track cars are slightly heavier than original hot wheels and do work slightly better on the wall tracks.<br /><br />However, my overall impression of the wall tracks hasn't been all that great.  Our 24 month old played with the wall tracks a ton for the first couple of days.  But now, a month after Xmas, I'm pretty sure he hasn't touched his hot wheels set up in over a week.  Point being, it is not a long lasting toy.... at least not yet anyway.  I'll update this review if it changes in the future.",

    "text": "I'm disappointed in this workbench.  Knowing I would eventually want to get our boy a tool bench, I started shopping for one when he was just when he was a newborn.  After carefully reviewing every bench on the market, this seemed like the best one, based on the reviews on several sites.<br /><br />But here are some of the reasons why I am disappointed:<br />- The vice (vise) grip no longer opens and closes like in the previous version.<br />- the nails and screws don't stay up on their own, you put them in the holes and they sink immediately (which completely defeats the purpose of pounding them down with a hammer).<br />- the batteries are already drained in the saw and drill press, and it hasn't even been out of the box for a month.<br />- the drill press lights are too bright and flash rapidly... seizure anyone???<br />- as you'll notice from the other uploaded pictures, the hooks that hang on the tools (like the screw driver, hammer, etc) fall out immediately.<br />- the storage shelf underneath is incredibly shallow; you really can't store anything of the extra pieces down there.  And even the slightest play motion from your toddler will knock everything off of the lower shelf.<br /><br />So with all that said, it still gets 3 stars because our 24 month old plays with it several times a day.<br /><br />And another FYI:  The last two years, the mega chain store with the bulls-eye logo has put this toy on sale during Black Friday weekend for $40 dollars, so Amazon drops their price too.  For $40, it was an ok buy.... but for the $60 dollars it is listed for now (or for the $80 it was listed for in the weeks on Amazon prior to black Friday), I feel like this was completely over-priced.  You'd be better off watching craig's list or finding it at a re-sale shop for the equally-as-good used version for around $25-30.  In fact, the older used version (where the vice grip is in the front, not on the side) would give you a working vice/vise grip; which I remember playing with a real version in my dad's workshop as a kid and it was a blast!!! (while he supervised of course) :-)",

And silly me, I saved it for Xmas when he was 23 months old.  I wish I would have gotten the other version and not the farm one.  The farm theme is everywhere (in his books, in his tv shows, and in other toys and puzzles) so I feel like the other board exposed him to different subjects he doesn't see as often.<br /><br />Also, the magnets are not very durable.  At 23 months, we had a bit of a regression and he started putting everything in his mouth again.  While I tried to stop it as soon as I saw him doing it, probably less than 30 seconds in his mouth, he was able to chew the drawings right off two the magnets.<br /><br />While still totally awesome and a great idea, I feel like the excitement of this puzzle was short lived.  We've played with traditional wooden puzzles far more often.  Maybe I gave it to him too late and possibly would have gotten more use out of it had I bought it when he was around 14-16 months old.",

Highly recommended and I look forward to buying the other M&D reusable sticker pads!!!!<br /><br />Three small problems:<br />1) They really do loose their clinginess after a while.  But according to the instructions on the back, you can wash them with dish washing soap to revive them.  I haven't tried it yet, so I can't say for sure if it works.<br /><br />2) The other thing is if you leave the stickers stuck on the scene pages (and don't put them back on the white pages they originally come on)they leave an oily looking gray stain on the pictures.<br /><br />3) In addition, the binding is cheap, so we no longer have a book.  Just a bunch of loose pages.<br /><br />I mention those things because I could see how those big things could bother some kids or some parents.

They save our 20 month old lots of frustration... since he isn't old enough to understand the laws of physics and why his tracks simply won't stay in place :-)  They save daddy lots of frustration, since he doesn't have to set the track back up five times a day!<br /><br />Be warned though, they do not and AREN'T meant to work with every single piece of wooden track (I'm talking about the specialty tracks pieces).  They only work on the strait, curved, and the pieces that are meant to go up or down one level.<br /><br />And there is no need to lock ever piece of train track together.  For example, you won't need to buy 100 Sure Track pieces to go with your 100 piece train set.  One set of dozen will probably do just fine for most families.<br /><br />And these are amazing for creating those \"floating through the air\" type track set ups.  Sure Tracks doesn't always eliminated the need for support underneath the track, but since they're holding the actual pieces together, it does allow for more flexibility on where the supports can be placed.<br /><br />ALSO GO BUY THESE TOO:<br />Your local dollar store sells little mini hair ties (for use one little girls hair... they're a little smaller than the size of a dime).  I picked up 500 clear bands for a dollar!!!!  Twist two or three around the \"male\" end of loose pieces.  Makes a world of difference and your track set up will stay together for hours!  BTW, I saw the mini hair tie tip after spending $6 \"Snug Trac\" rubber bands.  Total waste of money because the hair ties work better.<br /><br />So bottom line:  Buy this Sure Track set and the hair ties!!!",

Regardless of how many times we put the truck together and broke it apart, none of the pieces broke. In addition, what I liked most about this toy was how much fun it was to put the tuck together! My brother enjoyed this toy so much that he played with it for hours and constantly assembled and dissembled it. Overall, I think it's amazing that this company has created a toy that allows children to be creative and build their own toys.

This game is really about trying to mentally out maneuver your friends by coming up with words starting with whatever letter the die at the beginning of the round gave you that are unique enough to answer the prompt that no one else has thought of it.  If no one else thought of your answer you get a point and so on down the prompt card each round.  If your answer is the same as someone else's you both cross it out and lose that potential point.<br /><br />What I love about this game is the creativity in answers and how far you can bend the rules.  We always play that the group votes on whether your answer is valid or allowable since it always gets a little fuzzy as the game goes on and our competitive nature picks up.

    "text": "I love and play strategy board games often at home and with friends.  This game is one of my all time favorites and never gets old.  The game play requires you to pass your hand of cards to your neighbor after each turn so in you have to constantly be thinking of multiple paths to victory since you can't rely on any guaranteed single route.  But this is the joy of the game, it throws you around and doesn't allow you to plan.  Your neighbors are attacking you, the card you've been waiting for was just played by someone else, you have to adjust to how you see your opponents playing and try to keep your own civilization moving forward.<br /><br />This game is dense at the start, it will take you a first play through to understand the mechanics and some of the various paths to victory.  It is challenging but after you play it once it slides into place.  That's what I love about this game, there are so many (so many!) creative ways to gain the most victory points to win.  Every game of this is fresh and new based on how many players you're with and what cards happen to come your way or which civilization you start with.  It's at once semi-cooperative but also every person for themselves.<br /><br />This game is very well designed, it's won multiple awards and has endless replay-ability value.  I've taught this to friends who have won it their first time playing.  Each round of play works the same way so if you're introducing it to new players they'll begin feeling comfortable with the game play after the first few minutes.  It's a lot to explain upfront but once playing a single game goes fast (45 min - 1 hr) so you can get the first round done and move on to a second round where they'll understand it much better.<br /><br />I love this game, the mechanics are excellent and it's very original and challenging.  Up to 7 players is a treat since the game still moves fast with many people and this works beautifully.  Even with 3-4 people its still very fun.  If you like tabletop games with critical and creative thinking, this is one to get, just challenging enough.",

That's what makes this toy, the interactive nature of hammering or smacking the balls through the top to start them down the chute.  My niece got a similar Montessori style ball/chute toy for Christmas that was very expensive and pretty but this toy won out.  Great for toddlers, even her older sisters wanted a go with the hammer!",

Balderdash is a fun, easy to pick up game that all ages can understand and enjoy while laughing at some purely absurd answers.  It's become one of the main games in our rotation.<br /><br />Learn the basics in 5 minutes and average game play is about an hour (maybe an hour and a half with 5 or more people).  I will say repeatability with this game gets a bit less fun as you learn the tone of the true answer cards (the ones you're trying to detect while supplying your own fake answers to fool your competitors) and can pick them out amongst your friends cards.  But overall this game is silly and with some witty friends it is pure comedy, just playing the game can be more fun than winning.",

It seems these items are getting weaker & weaker but the price goes up & up......<br /><br />I don't get why I had to put the decals on.  Was I saving you that much money from having your factory workers do it?  If so, then cut the price since I am doing half the building.<br /><br />So why give it four stars?<br />Because my step-daughter is going to lose her mind when she gets this at Christmas.  I only pray it doesn't fall apart as I am worried about the weakness I already see.<br /><br />It's cute.  Very creative.  The driving seats come out & become the bathroom.  There is a small kitchen area in the back.  There is a bed which comes with a joke of a blanket & seriously??  two plastic pillows??  What the heck??  I like the couch with the pool slide level.  Cute.  Creative.  And I like the hammock.....but it will only fit small dolls....not the full Barbie.

This makes for a quick game since you already know all the rules.<br /><br />For Pixar fans....you will love the pieces!  There are six...Mr. Incredible, Lightning McQueen, Buzz Lightyear, Remy, Nemo & Sully with Boo.  I would have loved to seen more characters...but I understand the game is only for six people.  A few of my friends commented that they would have wanted Woody instead of Buzz...but maybe they could make a Toy Story Monopoly...hmmm...maybe they need to make a version for each movie?  Now there's an idea.<br /><br />The board is good.  The properties are things to do with the Pixar movies like A Bug's Life, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc, Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Cars, Ratatouille, & Finding Nemo.  I thought they did a good job on it.<br /><br />Everyone loved the cones & Al's Toy Barn for the houses & hotels.  Very clever.<br /><br />The one con I always have with Monopoly games...not enough money!  We kept running out of $100's & $50's the whole night.  But you learn to work around it.  Or else you bring in money from other games!  Guess it pays to be a Monopoly fan & have several editions!<br /><br />Overall, great game.  Still lots of fun & plenty of learning about money & building.  But mostly it's a great time with great friends to see who can bankrupt who!  And yes, I am evil in this game...but it's all in fun!!",

I do not like this version at all.<br /><br />Cons -<br />- only four people can play at once<br />- you upgrade your piece three times to attain the best value for certain cards<br />- not enough money in the game, which is normal in most of the Monopoly games<br />- the money is a bulky piece of cardboard which no one liked<br />- the cards you put onto the properties before the game starts are in a word, ridiculous<br />- the board is smaller than the original, only 8 spaces on a side thus throwing normal Monopoly players off when moving....we actually had to count the spaces!<br /><br />Pros -<br />- nothing<br /><br />The four of us that played really did not enjoy the game.  The rules are a little different & not at all easy.  The fortune cards places on the properties when you start the game are lame & sometimes not really clear.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sorry I bought this game.<br /><br />I purchased it locally at a store & wish I could return it....",

By the 5th round, we had to start using the box cards for pie instead of the DVD, there didn't appear to be any questions left.  Sorry Parker Brothers, it's a great game, but not worth the $40 for the amount of play.  We are hoping for new DVD additons so that we can play again.",

He has learned to use the manual screw driver correctly and can take the screws out and in with it. He doesn't use the battery driver as he finds it easier to just use the manual one. This has really taught him about the direction for off and on.<br />Cons: you have to take off the bottom of the car to plug it into the charger.  Wish I could purchase some extra screws.<br />Update: the customer service is amazing! I contacted them to get extra screws and they really came through! This continues to be my grandson's favorite.

The tea pot is a totally universal item because of its shape and size.  It can double as a soup, ice cream, or cereal bowl from which a child can sip liquid through the pour spout.

My daughter also has a DS lite and this is much more suitable to her age. Most of the games for the ds are a little above her so this fills the in between years well.

I don't enjoy puzzles that have so much of the same color that I lose my mind trying to put it together.<br />The puzzle pieces for mine fit together perfectly and very snug. In fact, that is the pro and the con of this puzzle. After I was finished, I was able to pick the entire thing up. I could've hung it on the wall without any glue whatsoever. When placing it back into the box, I had to literally disconnect every single piece because shaking it and bending it did not work. I didn't mind though.

I honestly can't say that's true. First of all, there are so many features to pay attention to and somehow the game is ruined because they added more variety to the skin one? The range in skin color in combination with other GENERIC features is such that it can be kind of ambiguous. Like there are a lot of characters where I'm wondering if I'm looking at a really tanned white person with blue eyes or a person of color. It wouldn't necessarily be that helpful to bother asking in order to knock down only a few with confidence. Others have complained that it opens the opportunity to eliminate characters based on skin color like that would somehow foster discriminatory children. Really? Would it really be so bad to recognize different skin colors? Last I checked blind people can't play this game and we all know if you were questioned for a description of a person by police that if you really saw the person you'd be able to do so without any issues.

    "text": "Please note for the pictures I purposely selected dark cards to showcase the sleeves. Brighter cards are going to be much easier to see. This is my first time buying sleeves for my board game cards. Not sure what to expect but I really like them. They feel like quality sleeves that won't break easily. They are a bit slippery, not sure how normal that is. The slipperiness makes shuffling the cards along the sides really easy which also keeps me from having to bend the cards. A traditional shuffle is quite harder. These sleeves add considerable bulk to a deck, which is as expected with any sleeves. Don't expect to be able to keep any insert trays that come with a game. Keeping large stacks from toppling is an issue but we just break the stack into smaller stacks. A few times a little clumsy finger tap from trying to grab the top card has sent 2-3 cards flying off the top. I probably would not use these for a true card game. After having tried Gamegenic's sleeves made specific for a certain game and seeing how snug and perfect those are, I can attest to there being a little extra unnecessary room, if using standard card sizes, especially at the top, but it's not as bad as the extra space I've seen for fantasy flight sleeves. The extra space at the top of fantasy flight (from reviews) turned me off personally but I think these are tolerable. The only thing is that if all the cards are stacked facing the same way, the unused space causes a deck to stack with a tilt. With the matte sleeves, I haven't experienced any eye strain or heard any complaints. The matte does knock down the visibility a little but I don't think it takes away from the experience much and I think it's as expected for any matte sleeve. Lastly, I think the sleeving process was pretty easy, but again, I have little experience. The game-tailored sleeves were a bit tougher to put on in comparison but they were also bigger cards so they'd already be inherently harder to sleeve.",

Took me about 3+ hrs to learn how to play and a few 1-2 hr play throughs before I got the hang of it and there's probably still something I'm overlooking. The game is fun and easy once you understand how to play but it's very complicated and could easily overwhelm new players. There's just a lot to keep track of. There are a lot of moments where we pause and question if there's anything we missed which makes the game feel like it's going slower.<br /><br />Also, while I think they nailed some parts of the rulebook, like visually showing game setup and having an index, I think in a lot of ways the rulebook could've been done better. I frequently have to flip through several different pages to better understand one thing and I'll feel like I still didn't get an answer.<br /><br />The game is supposedly designed to prevent “alpha players” but there's really no built-in defense against delta players. My current designated playmate, despite having played several games, has me hold their hand through almost every single step for their own play and requests my guidance to the point that I can't focus on my own play until they're done with theirs. When I prompt for coordination for just a small portion of my play, whether due to being a poor team player or not having the confidence with the rules, it's not reciprocated and then I'm somehow a nuisance to them for “taking forever” because I'm finally able to set up my own play. Granted, I might not have the most ideal playmate right now but hosting a game night, especially with multiple new players, currently seems like a nightmare. So with that... it's great for solo play!! Again, love the game",

I would have loved a toy like this when I was little... part of me is a little jealous that my son gets to have her and I didn't!  ;)  I'm considering picking up a second one as a spare....",

The wave sound soothes him and we use it to put him to sleep every night. He needed surgery when he was 2 months old, and we brought it to the hospital with us for use afterward. It seemed to comfort him then, too! We always take it with us on car rides and it's our go-to when we need to calm our little boy. The music is nice, too, and I usually play it for my son during his morning feed. Loud, quiet, and off settings are great. I do wish there was an option to leave it on for more than 15 minutes, but that's the only thing I'd change!",

I think the best think about this set is that there are two full rides to build and each of them work, as in you can put the characters into the seats and then have them use the rides. There are also a couple of smaller buildings that you can build when you have less time.<br />This set is clearly more geared towards girls, which I liked, and the figures are different than the standard LEGO figures you might be used to.<br />I would recommend this set for older kids 7-10 because there are an extreme amount of very small pieces, if your child is younger than this I would recommend a lot of supervision.<br />I highly recommend this set and I hope to do more of them in the future.",

The only real downside to this cool feature is that the bags can't exactly be labels as bag 1, bag 2, etc because the pieces will be put together differently based on what you choose. So there is a lot of hunting around for the right pieces while putting this set together.<br /><br />I could easily see this being enjoyable for a child, but be aware there are a lot of really small pieces in this set, it will be easy to drop things so it might not be the best for younger kids.

Enter Cassie the cow, or at least that's what we named her. She is huge, which is great, and super well made. Even with a 90 pound dog laying down on her every day she really hasn't flatten out at all. Our dog occasionally carries her in his mouth and she has no damage from it at all.

    "text": "I love Star Trek, I'm slightly obsessed (okay more than slightly) anyway I have been looking for a fun Star Trek themed game to be able to play on game nights, and when I saw this one I knew I had to have it. Some of the questions are easier, some of them are definitely hard to get right, even for someone who watches the tv series on netflix all the time. I liked that there is a mix of all the different series, and I liked that the game can be made shorter if you don't have a lot of time. This was a great game for us at our house and we love playing it.",
