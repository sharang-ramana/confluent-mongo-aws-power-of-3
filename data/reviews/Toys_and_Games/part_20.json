Although it's pretty stress and tension-free - and you can enjoy &#34;brain-rest&#34;, there is some strategy involved! The kids love it, and it's a great after dinner treat - &#34;We can play Don't Spill the Beans if you eat all your carrots&#34;!  A couple games is enough, but the interaction with the kids is so nice before bedtime.  Some games take too long, or are too high-powered and get the kids too wound up.  Don't Spill the beans is just right!",

But, the &#34;beginner&#34; aspect caused me to give it another look.  There's a base at the bottom that makes getting the knack of this a lot easier - and safer.  It easily detaches, when the jumper moves on to &#34;pro&#34; level.  Since helmets are the thing now, I felt I would not be adding danger to his life with this gift.  I'm impressed with how the pogo stick is put together - I checked to be sure it's operating smoothly.  The grips are good &#34;hand-sized&#34;, the foot pedals are ample, and the base is skid resistant.  Since the grandson is already a jumper, this should add a fun way to express himself!",

    "text": "The decision to order the Sky Viper Drone began with one aviation-obsessed Grandma's wish to introduce a six-year-old grandson to flight in a more tangible way than zooming around the house playing &#34;pretend&#34;.  The seed was planted and flourished when I got the Hot Wheels Sky Shock - the car that morphs into a plane and lands and takes off via a remote control.  My grandson quickly became adept at controlling that plane, and has had fun with it for months now.  Enter the 22 year old photographer grandson, who thought about putting a GoPro on the Sky Shock - impossible, as it couldn't support the weight and still fly.  So, that leads me to the reason for ordering the Sky Viper, which can be enjoyed and used with the cousins - Mason will learn even more about flight, and Ryan can experiment with the Sky Viper's video camera and figure out applications for his photography.  Christmas is my chance to get this plan in motion.  The drone is very light, and appears to be well-made.  It requires 3 AAA batteries and includes a lithium battery which can be re-charged.  I'm impressed with the auto launch, land and hover, which will take some of the difficulty out of operating the remote right away. My only concern is the length of time that the batteries will allow us to fly!  That's the frustration with the Sky Shock - very little real time in the air and for &#34;touch and go's&#34;. Obviously, I will be amending this review after we've had a chance to operate the drone.  I've seen drones priced very expensively, which deterred me from my &#34;plan&#34;.  I feel that this Sky Viper is a great opportunity to get an idea of what can be done with a drone, at a reasonable price.",

We settled on a weekend school yard, which worked out fine (my backyard is not big enough for all the fun with the &#34;Sky Shock&#34;).  Suggest you do some slower stuff with this thing to get the feeling of the remote before you go to high speeds - but you'll need the high speed for it to take-off - which, of my gosh, it did!  Then, the real fun began, as it was another big learning experience working with the remote.  This is a great toy, but needs supervision in the beginning with older kids, and maybe all the time with younger ones.  We're ready for the big &#34;reveal&#34; this afternoon, and the grandson is sure to be blown away, as we're going to let the take-off surprise him!

His Dad was able to handle the hook-up (pardon the lack of proper terms) and my grandson was off and running with his Moff Band in no time.  So far, it is a favorite toy, and keeps him off the couch.  It requires his Dad's IPhone app, so it does unite father and son more than before.  So far, so good!",

Etsy has some but they're not cheap.  Some charged extra for a chef hat.  Though this set isn't cheap, the quality is what you pay for.  It is a nice lightweight cotton with pockets.  The apron &amp; chef hat are made of the same material and match in color.  I like that it's 100% cotton as if it is stained (which I'm more then sure it will be) it can be cleaned with Fels Naptha soap to get it a bright white again.<br />The chef hat is adjustable with velcro.  The design is such that it's not intrusive of the overall look.<br />I don't know how old the child is with the set on in the item description but I do not think this would fit a 10 year old.  I believe the max age would be 8 years old.<br />I was able to purchase this for a certain precentage off in hopes that I would review the product honestly.",

I have purchased two of these carts before, one with a hedgehog on the side and the other with an owl. Those were for granddaughters, they both had a larger cart capacity so they could sit inside. The cart helped them stabilize when they were learning to walk and then gave them many options for practicing their growing skillsets over the next several years. Besides the push and pull advertised, they put in and took out their treasures, took their favorite items with them all around the house, and sat inside while an older sibling pushed them around. This airplane probably lacks the ability to sit inside it and won't hold as much inside, but it has built in toys the other carts lacked adding additional skill sets to practice.  I especially like that children are drawn to the toy naturally, no added BELLS and WHISTLES, so to speak, get in the way of the child using the toy in ways best suited to his or her current creative, intellectual, and physical needs.",

I know she will grow into it. What really pleased me when she opened her birthday gift was her reaction to the book!  She loves it.  She sat down and looked through the pages while her mother explained that they could work together in their kitchen cooking yummy food.  About a week after she got the book I received a Marco Polo from them. My grand daughter wanted to show me the Cake Pops they had made. She held each one up, one by one, for me to see and told me they ran out of sprinkles. Her five year old brother had helped and as she held up the last few cake pops her older brother pointed out the tiny chocolate chips on them as a stand in for sprinkles. I can see many moments of learning and pleasure ahead as my grandchildren learn basic cooking skills with their mother through this little recipe book. The dress up apron and chef hat are a nice bonus, and I am sure some little girls would go right for them and toss the book aside. In this instance my main goal was met for this little grand daughter and her family. Soon her one year old brother, who shares the same birthday as her, will join in the family cooking experiences. This is a gift that can bring the family together providing mutual enjoyment and personal satisfaction.",

Instructions could have been clearer but I think that was a fun part of the puzzle to figure out. For me personally the only reason I would not purchase another one is only because the pieces are so small that it was extremely difficult.",

I did have to put almost this entire thing together for my daughter. She isn't old enough to put these together on her own. I'd say she'd need to be 8-9 to do that and even still there might be some frustration. But she has loved playing with it! She plays school with it. So cute! So many classroom options even a bathroom with stalls!!<br /><br />Some cons:<br />- some of the sticker decorations were not cut correctly and had extra hanging off (see image)<br />- this takes a lot of time to put together even for an adult. The way the pieces were packaged did not align with the directions so you find yourself digging for pieces from all different plastic packages and that in itself takes a lot of time.",

We do own a lot of character figures already so she uses those in the box car. But if you don't have those doesn't give a child much to do with it except use the remote control. Needs a lot of batteries. Advertised as ready to play....but that's not true until you put all the batteries in. Olaf spinning is cute. But would've even better if they could take the figurines off and play with them. Plastic track pieces. Which are pretty basic. Does get the initially wow from the child but ends up being a toy that sits in the corner of our playroom.",

It comes out shivering and shaking and they make it feel better by giving it a bath. My daughter was so in to saving her kitty. It does make lots of different noises. And she can feed it and it hiccups! Which she loves. I really like that we could have a conversation about saving animals after. Instills a valuable lesson.<br />The reason I took a star off:<br />-Even after bathing it is pretty mangy.<br />-the sounds are harder to get to work the more she plays with it. So I'm guessing the battery is going out. So the battery doesn't last super long in it.",

The only downside is they advertised a picture of a unicorn in the directions as a trinket that comes that you can “bury” in your slime. Yes, it says that the trinkets or characters you get vary, but it's kind of disappointing to a 4 year old when there is a unicorn on the picture and they got a cloud 🤷🏼‍♀️.

It would have been nice to have a stand of some sort besides just the cupcakes to grab from and sort and resort with to and from the cup cakes. Also as other reviewers have said having a picture of an elephant was probably not the best call when beginner learners are making the words. Best to stick with CVC, CVCe, CVCC, CVVC words. As an elementary teacher (which I am) I would have been frustrated with this set in my classroom as the skill set for words isn't quite right. Probably the best use in the classroom would be to set the letters (lowercase and uppercase) with the matching word images (ie, image of dog) on top of cupcake for beginning letter recognition.",

My daughter enjoys playing with it and the light up mane is a nice extra feature. The noises it makes are not to loud so it is not overly annoying to adults that have to hear it throughout the day.  The fingerling having a baby is also fun for my daughter as it gives her more to do with imaginative play for the toy.",

I ended up using my own glue to put it together since it wasn't staying together with the glue provided. Once we put it together my daughter loved it though and has loved playing with it after the creation part. The story provided in the directions booklet is really cute! And my daughter and I loved reading it together.<br />Know that if you are doing this with a 4 year old the adult will be basically putting most of it together.",

This one the pieces do not make sound when you put them in, it only makes sound when you push the yellow round button. She likes to play with it she just likes the farm one more. So if you are wanting one that each piece makes a sound buy the &#34;Laugh and Learn&#34; fisher price line of puzzles not the &#34;Silly Sounds&#34; line.

It comes with several different cards for several games. I wish it had 2 buttons on the front. The kids and adults sat around at Christmas and someone always seemed to be playing on it. The only other issue was that to get the balls out of the pockets for a new game, you have to turn it upside down, and this means the plug at the top is useless unless you hold it down. Just don't flip it over anything you don't want water dripping on. Otherwise, it is fun to share these \"old fashioned\" games with my children and see them play.",

I enjoy working on them and this one is taking me a while.  Some people do puzzles quickly,  but it can take me months as I work few hours a day.  Good puzzle!",

For some reason those images are not near as popular as the 50's images.<br /><br />One of the most famous artist of our time was Norman Rockwell (1894-1978).  His American images were everywhere, and loved by millions.  Few are etched into the mind permanently.  The pictures were sweet, charming,  typical American business, family, with pure and innocent small town themes.  Rockwell decided that the world was not a perfect place, and he chose to paint the ideal aspects of the world.<br /><br />He was commissioned to paint for the Saturday Evening Post, 321 covers.  It appears as if this image was perhaps painted as a collage of summer theme images in America.<br /><br />The puzzle is 1,000 pieces, the pieces are solid, good material and they interlock well.  There were some challenges here, but all in all, it was not that difficult.  When puzzles have numerous images, it makes it easier to separate, but yet too many images also makes it challenging to find out where you want to start, and how much can you work on while you lay this out<br /><br />There are more difficult sections to work on, and with so many different sections, it makes it more challenging to spread out ....Rizzo",

The directions were complicated and we even missed the fact that when more than one person answered a category question correctly, they had to have a playoff for it. The trivia facts were interesting, but it just grew monotonous after a while, and that was odd, because this group is fond of both \"Trivial Pursuit\" and \"Chronology.\" Interestingly, the teenage players got several questions correct because \"We saw that on the Discovery Channel!\" (So, rejoice folks, some kids ARE learning facts watching the right television stations!)

The string is a little tedious to wind up but that is due to the nature of the Yo-yo. My son has found a way to deal with it.<br /><br />Is the Yo-yo slightly over priced?  Possibly, I have seen it cheaper but so far it has been a solid Yo-yo and my son has enjoyed it and learning new tricks.

Operating it is intuitive and the brightly colored LCD screen is a plus..  The puzzle games are plus while traveling in the car. Even can function as a MP3 player which can be good and bad, given some of todays wonderful children's songs that turn into ear worms.<br /><br />I'm have been more than pleased with this product and think it is a great buy.",

He said this was similar to all<br />Of them…the pieces, instructions were similar and just as challenging.<br /><br />The product matched the description in the ad.  It arrived nicely packaged, no issues with shipping.  No pieces were missing and came with plenty of spares, see picture.  The movement was smooth after a little of adjustments; note, if you have issues make sure the little red plus signs pegs are pressed all the way in.  If they are not, then they will drag a but and make the movement rough, see close up picture.<br /><br />I gave “easy to assembly” a 4 but is in no way a knock on the product.  I would actually change that to level of challenge with 5 being the most difficult.  The instruction were clear with minimal ambiguity.<br /><br />It took my son roughly 6 hours to build the ~1000 piece model and he enjoyed every minute.  He made one mistake while building but was able to catch it at a later step and easily fixed the issue.",

The most time consuming part of the game is just reading through everything. Once we got through everything, we had a blast. We were putting sticky notes on the pics to help us figure things out. We will definitely purchase another of these games, if not all of them. It was perfect for the two of us. I love that there are clues and evidence mixed in to throw you off. This game is awesome.
