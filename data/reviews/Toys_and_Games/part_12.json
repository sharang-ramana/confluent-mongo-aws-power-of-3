What I like most other than the good construction is drawers on all sides.  This helps to store those partially completed sections.  Plus, as family activity everyone can have their side and personal drawer.<br /><br />Overall, this is very good quality, and this is the one we use on our table.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)",

It is easy for them to catch the hang of it.  Very safe too and low to the ground profile.  No tipping!!!<br /><br />Indoor or outdoor use in no problem for this.  The non-plastic wheels allow great traction on hardwood and linoleum floors.  Also, it has a 150 lb max weight.  That a big toddler or child. But, it doe show that this is a quality construction.<br /><br />Highly Enjoyable and Well Designed!!!",

The water cannon is ok, but any $1 spray gun will work the same.  It is a neat concept, but in my estimation the price point is high.  The valve make for an easier inflate, but a lager valve that screws on would have been even better.  But, the lack of thickness of this material probably would not hold a better and bigger valve system.

The children can go down it together and even do log rolls down the slide with their bodies.  The basketball hoop is fun and we added extra balls for shooting hoops.  The ball pit area is ok, but I would have preferred more bounce area instead.  Overall; so much to do and keeps the children entertained for hours.

The puzzle pieces actually lay nice and flat too.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)",

For example, the letters, the foundation stand, hooks if you desired to hang it on a wall.<br /><br />Now, the actually design is so unique and clever.  Premium plywood that is engraved.  The details burst out of the wood.  This would make a perfect addition to any child's room.  I have it displayed above our fireplace (that we don't use) in our dinning room.  This has me digging through my old boxes to get out those old matchbox cars and to display them.  This has a nice heavy weight to it.  Very durable too.

My only recommendation is to add some felt or rubber feet to the bottom of the game.

The three speeds is also so fun and easy!  It even includes 2 batteries!  You have almost an hour of flying without using the lights.

The scenes are cute, the characters are ones we know from Disney films, and at 1000 pieces we figured it would be a piece of cake to do right????  Wrong.  We started to do the edging pieces and discovered they were all way too similar and it was almost impossible to tell where they were actually supposed to go. ie, they fit in every single spot that they could fit regardless if that was where they belonged or not.  So we figured we'd go ahead and do the scenes of the puzzle and then work in the edge afterwards.  Yeah, well that didn't work either.  We finally made sure we got the corners right since there the design is different (characters) and just winged it for the rest of the edge pieces.  We actually spent longer trying to get the edge right than we did for the main part of the puzzle (and since the puzzle is small, it's extremely difficult to 'see' the subtle differences in the design.  Cute design but the edge pieces are frustrating.",

My son is autistic so it was overwhelming for him at first but we worked on the borders between the scenes and had different bins for the various scenes so once we found pieces and knew where they belonged we'd put them in their designated baggie.  He really got into it once we started seeing the scenes come together - and loved it when I was stumped by various pieces and he was able to find them.  Honestly - it's a great puzzle for the entire family!<br /><br />On a side note, while we were not missing any pieces there is a flyer in the box letting you know that if you are missing a piece you can note on the flyer where the piece is and send the paper to the company and they will get the missing piece to you.  I'm soooo impressed with that I just had to mention it!  Top notch company",

I think a young child who is highly mobile would love chasing the balls and listening to the music from this toy.

Normally she shows no interest in doing anything but she was actually trying to use her troubled hand and showed no frustration with her lack of abilities.  The kitchen is built well and provides hours of fun for the young - and young at heart.  The colors are eye catching and the kids really enjoyed pretending to cook.

We've hit the point we don't even try to put everything back in the bag - just stack everything to one side of the living room (yep it's been raining practically since this game arrived).  and the plastic 'stands' are a little difficult to get into the holes in the board so that they can stand up.<br /><br />All in all this is a fun game for all ages or athletic abilities so everyone can feel included!",

My daughter is always making wands and waving them around, so having one that seems to write magically on a screen was really fun for her. If you want to play it just as Pictionary, you can always resort to a regular paper and pencil.<br /><br />I found it was just as much fun playing with the wand as it was playing the actual game.

    "text": "The box says that the minimum player age should be 10, but we played with our 7 year old and she beat us on the first round. Gameplay is pretty easy to pick up, but I recommend doing a practice round of the first module to make sure you understand the scoring. Our error on our first round was that we didn't know each player started with 10 points, so when the time came to assess points, we all had negative totals. There is a very good YouTube tutorial to help you get started.<br /><br />There are four identical cards and players lay out buildings that are similar to Tetris shapes around various landforms. The strategy comes from learning how to manage your board by keeping account of your remaining shapes. You can glance over at your remaining shapes to help plan your layout. It's important to leave spaces for some of the bigger shapes.<br /><br />The fun part about this game is that it comes with a series of sealed envelopes that explain new variations. Sometimes you are able to earn points by grouping your buildings by color, or building around a well. You add stickers to the board as you go. The player that wins a round is given points in the overall scoring. However, when you win a round, you are likely to have to add a sticker to your board which has the potential to cost you points. This helps ensure competitive gameplay.<br /><br />In addition to the legacy game, there are also rules for a single session game you can repeat as often as you like. My family found this game engaging and they enjoyed placing the pieces and learning new strategies. This is a good game that combines a lot of interesting concepts into an enjoyable final product.",

The pieces don't snap together, so we've been using small pieces of tape to hold the pieces together while the glue dries.<br /><br />The kit helps develop an awareness for how furniture goes together. There is fabric to make bedding and even cushion stuffing to go inside chairs and give them form. The instructions are easy to follow and the pieces come in bags that are well-organized. I would compare this kit to putting together a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle. It takes a lot of time and effort, but once you get into the flow it's relaxing. Please note that this isn't a kit that your kids can assemble and play with. It's more of a display model.

The cards and clock faces are of good quality and hold up to frequent handling and use. The clock faces are also dry erase boards, and my girls enjoyed writing down the times they were looking for and then cleaning off the surface.<br /><br />If you have young children who want to improve their ability to tell time, or you're looking for a great classroom activity, this set is a good choice.",

    "text": "This is a fun little car that is easy to operate and can hold up to the rough play of little kids. The controls operate each set of tires and feature forward and reverse. You turn the car by accelerating one set of wheels more than the other. You can make the car spin by holding one set of wheels in forward and the other set in reverse.<br /><br />The car lights up so that you can find it easily if you accidentally drive it under a sofa or other furniture. The car operates on 4 AAA batteries and the remote requires 2 AA batteries. The battery covers are screwed into place which requires a small screwdriver. The only problem is that sometimes when you crash the car into something it dislodges the battery and you have to open the cover to reset it. As you get better at driving the vehicle this should happen with less frequency.<br /><br />The car is durable and easy to drive. This is a fun choice for a first remote controlled vehicle and will delight any child that receives it.",

The two main pieces are a speaker and a control board. These pieces fit into a cardboard stand. I think there is great value to kits that allow children to assemble and disassemble tech devices, but I wish this kit had more applications. I like that it comes with the 3 batteries already installed. If you have a thoughtful child who is curious about learning the science of musical sound, this kit will be a nice accessory. However, this isn't the kind of gift you give to a child to keep them entertained on their own. The best part of this gift will be the time you spend with your child exploring what this kit has to offer.",

    "text": "This is a really good concept, and you can use it to stream songs via Bluetooth or to play your CDs right out of the box. However, to get the full karaoke effect you need the CDG disk. CDG stands for CD plus graphics, and that's where you get the lyrics and the little bouncing ball. There is an option to go to a web page and type in the date code and receipt number. The manufacturer promises the CDG in 4-6 weeks once the information has been confirmed. So, if you're purchasing this for a gift, open it and send off for the free disc before you lose your receipt. If you purchase this on Amazon, you should be able to retrieve your receipt number from your purchases list.<br /><br />The unit itself is very portable and easy for children to handle. The microphone is small enough that they can hold it easily. The volume for the unit is acceptable, but it doesn't get so loud that it will give parents or neighbors a headache. I wish they had included the disc rather than have the mail in option. However, there are many Disney Karaoke discs available to be purchased separately.<br /><br />This is a very fun product that will entertain your kids. It does involve a bit of screen time with the lyrics, but I feel singing is a very social activity that provides a lot of positive stimulation. Singing is a creative pursuit, and this is a fun toy for parties. Your kids will have a blast, and they might even learn the introductory elements of audio engineering as a bonus.",

The pieces all snap together with ease, and there are a few components that require tying string, but it's a very easy assembly. If you have other fairy figurines, this fairy boat integrates quickly into your child's world of play.

It has 116 pieces which is enough to keep your children busy and challenged, but not so much that they become frustrated or overwhelmed. My girls are 7 and 9 and this is the perfect size LEGO kit for them. The Frozen II theme helps inspire their imagination with scenes from one of their favorite franchises. This set includes figurines of Elsa and Sven which they absolutely love. The box is a good size and makes for an attractive present when wrapped. This is a great choice for a birthday party present.

The blocks are similar to Lego, but Mega Construx offers articulated motion once the job is complete. That means that you're building a toy you can actually play with! The box says it has 735 pieces, and the instruction manuals are detailed and easy to follow. There are even cloth attachments to make the dragon's wings look real. The box says for ages 16+ but I have my 9 year old daughter working on this and she's having a great time. This Daenerys and Drogon set is the perfect way to pry your kids away from cell phones or television to spend a little quality time on a fun activity. Makes a great gift!",

If you're a grandma or grandpa, this kit would be a great choice for a day of visiting the little ones. Elmer's magical liquid slime activator works a lot better than home slime recipes you might find on the internet. Make sure you have a large bowl for making the slime, but once you have the mix right, this stuff is not sticky (although I still wouldn't recommend dropping it on a carpet or on furniture). Your kids will giggle and you'll have a blast, just make it and use it in a craft area.",

The box says 569 pieces, which is enough to build a lot of different objects.<br /><br />As a parent, it's not hard to see the advantage of Lego sets. Although I think it's a little ridiculous to assume that your kid will grow up to be an engineer if they play with Legos, it's easy to see the benefit of a toy that makes children follow rigorous and complex instructions.<br /><br />The build diagrams are a lot like you will encounter on any number of products in your lifetime, for everything from maintaining your vacuum cleaner, to the owner's manual of your vehicle, to how to put on a compression valve. The early you learn how to sit down and interpret an instructional diagram, the better equipped you are to deal with life.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about Lego sets is that even though they are a rigorous mental exercise, kids love digging into them each and every time. This set is triple the fun as it contains the instructions for three different builds. My kids are 7 and 9 and they put together the boat in a couple hours. The boat even has a mechanism that allows you to spin a handle on the top and it makes the propeller spin (although we couldn't quite get the piece to set in place properly). Still, this is a complex build that gives a little bit of insight into gearing.<br /><br />The best part is, once they're done building all the suggestions, they break the whole thing down and start constructing fortresses and whatnot. I have never seen a kid disappointed to receive a Lego set ever. Great toy.",

    "text": "This fire truck set is exactly what you would expect from a high-quality Lego set. I picked this up the other day to put together with my 9 and 6 year old girls. It kept them focused and busy for a couple hours, and it was fun to watch them work together and consult the directions.<br /><br />I included several pictures with a penny to indicate scale. The item comes in a good sized box that is perfect for birthday or Christmas presents. The box size is large enough that it would look great when wrapped. Nobody likes to show up at a birthday party with a gift the size of a deck of cards. The size of the box is perfect for putting under a Christmas tree and letting your kids dream and wonder about what might be inside.<br /><br />There are 201 pieces in this kit, so it takes a while to put together and can be torn down again for reuse or rebuilding. My youngest is 6, and this set is ideal for children both younger and older than she is. The only thing to be concerned with is allowing very young children to play with the set because young children tend to put things in their mouth and the small pieces are a choking hazard. The only other hazard to Lego sets is stepping on the pieces in the night and issuing a bloodcurdling scream that provokes your wife to call the police. As long as you put the pieces away, you should be able to avoid this embarrassment.<br /><br />My kids liked how the fireman comes with a spring loaded fire hose that \"shoots\" little blue Lego pieces to combat a blaze. They don't go farther than about 4 or 5 inches unless you've got a really slippery floor. The wheels roll on the fire truck when built, so this is a cool little set. We had a great time, and I bet I can dismantle the truck, stick it in a box, and break it out again in four or five months for another fun day with the girls. Personally, I've never gotten sick of playing with Lego kits, and I bet your kids won't get sick of them either. Recommended.",

Not phenomenal, but good and probably a good gift for anyone that doesn't have any decks to play with.

Every game I want to play needs the select button to play, so they can't be played. That makes it useless at the end of the day.<br /><br />Very sad to have been so close. The aspect ratio is also WAY off on game boy games. As for the other games, they stuttered a lot and were very hard to play because of that.

The paint job in the numbers could have been better for the price. Overall, they are good quality dice, so I'll rate them highly, but I personally don't see the point in paying many times the price for dice that are slightly sharper edged.

    "text": "SO the large one is so large it doesn't really work right. It MIGHT be good for going down stairs though (don't have any to test) But the small ones so small it doesn't work really. The mid size one of course is just right and gives you the traditional slinky action.<br /><br />One gripe is they have some weird ends on these that look kinda cheap. I don't remember seeing these growing up, maybe it's a new safety thing or a cheaper end but the ends of them look tacky.<br /><br />Overall it's a cute set and it's not a terrible price so you may as well get it and give it a try if you have a want for multiple sized slinkies. Personally- I'll just stick with the traditional mid sized one that comes in this kit. (the regular size)",

The score sensors work great. The whole thing is a little bit wobbly of course due to the design, the whole middle part is fabric so it's going to have a little wobble to it of course. It doesn't make it unusable though and isn't the end of the world.<br /><br />Honestly the only complaint I have is I feel like this is a bit pricey and you're paying for a brand name. This should be more like $150 in my opinion but if you're fine with the price point then this is pretty nice and you'll like it. It's big enough for adults to enjoy too.

Really, their use is only limited by your imagination.<br /><br />I do however wish there were more NPC cards though. You go through so many NPCs in just one big campaign, I really feel there needs to be at least double. I would love to see some pretty huge NPC packs come out from this company. The box is a nice presentation, and the cards are really good quality. Love the art on the NPCs a lot.<br /><br />My only real complaint about this set is the money, fifty dollars for cards seems a bit much, even if they are really great cards. I mean, you don't even save anything really buying the genesis version over the other sets individually. Although, you do get some nice bonus cards, including four NPCs, which I did say you need more of. Ultimately, I'd still recommend this to most anyone.",

So please lock up the guns and don't let your kids play with this or watch the series. I'm not some crazy anti gun person, I own several.

If you know what the cards mean to you, then you don't need any symbols after all.<br /><br />Now, for the technical issues I have with this set, XI Strength and VIII Justice are switched, Page of cups is misspelled as Pace, There are eleven cups on the ten of cups, seven swords on the eight of swords and many of the wands are missing a wand from their image, but it may be they are all off on the side where the border covers them, in which case, that is also likely what happened with the eight of swords.

Frankly, too nice as I don't want to use it now. lol But seriously, it is great to have, as it can spice up traditional games, or be used for made up games where you'd have to supply your own fake money. I use it for table top role playing games and everyone always loves it. Only things I could consider to suggest, is printing it on thicker paper, as it is really fragile, I wouldn't give this to kids if you want it to stay nice; and to maybe have less pink and add in other colors.",

It comes with four plastic figures, gems, lots of tokens and tons of cards, plus a very nice bag to put it all into.<br /><br />When mine came, the instructions and score pad were hanging half way out of the box when they closed the lid, badly damaging the lid, box, score pad and instructions.

    "text": "The game itself is pretty fun. It's quick to learn for a strategy card game and fun to play. A good variety in cards means no two games are really ever going to be exactly the same. There really isn't anything bad I can think of to say about the game play itself, I've had nothing buy fun playing it and I have played it a lot. The art work is all very nice and fitting to the setting.<br /><br />There were however some quality issues with my set. Four of the same card is misprinted with the wrong type written, which was quite confusing and took some time to figure out. When packaged, the cards are split into two slots in a tray for storage, and then plastic gems added in one of the two slots. The gems are very sharp and pokey, and there was so little room, the gems stabbed the top card a whole bunch, which makes it look very ugly and you can tell what card it is before it's even drawn. This could have been easily fixed by putting more cards in one slot, as there was plenty of room, and then the gems wouldn't have been pressed so hard into the cards they were with. Lastly, my game board was misglued, and looks really bad, and it's the side you play on of course. Though, it is still useable.<br /><br />I still would recommend it though, I don't see anyone else mention the problems I have with my set, so I'm sure it'll be fine, and none of those problems prevent play. As I said above, it is very fun.",

I soaked the block in water, as I didn't want to take hours to dig them out, and after a little bit, I was able to pull the fossils out of the block with ease. I got this kit specifically for the trilobite, as I have always wanted one and didn't have one yet. So imagine my dismay when my new trilobite is crumbling to pieces in front of me. It couldn't have been damaged by my not digging correctly, as I didn't even dig at all.<br /><br />I looked it over and I was upset to find spots that had been glued together. That tells me they knew it was coming apart when they included it. I guess they thought it was going to go to a kid who would just assume they broke it by being careless and would just throw it out and not care, but I personally don't like that they included a piece that was crumbling. There are other reviews that have the same problem with their trilobite crumbling and there are also others with pictures of the same.<br /><br />The other fossils are all fine, and if you don't care at all about the trilobite, then I guess this kit is still ok to get.

When I first turned it on, it was flashing rapidly and making a headache inducing shriek for a very long time before I could make it stop. The instructions are crazy hard to understand, and you program it by clicking a button a certain number of times, after holding the button for a certain amount of time, based on what mode it is in and what mode you want to get to and then cycle through that modes different settings, and since I had no idea what settings it had when it came to me, I had to spend a very long time figuring out what all it's settings were, and how to then change each of those settings.",

The eyes are easy enough to see out of and the nose part is easy to breathe out of but being as the mask is a bit too small, the eyes and nose both kind of jabbed into my face and made the mask that much more uncomfortable! Definitely won't be able to wear glasses with these and if it's tight on you like it is me, you'll be hard pressed to wear contacts without this thing knocking those out!<br /><br />Not happy with this mask at all sadly, don't know why it's so tiny!",

But I love that it has a great amount of games! Honestly I feel this would be better priced at $20-$25, as the $40 it's listed at now is a bit much for the cheap handheld system. YES it works but it is on the cheaper side and they absolutely could put this at a lower price point considering none of these games are legally licensed and they didn't have to pay for them. The only cost they're out is the little handheld system that probably cost them $5 to make so the price point is a little inflated in my opinion.

But at this price point- zero complaints, this game is fantastic!<br /><br />When you unfold the game it instantly starts the Jumanji drumming and then the little screen in the middle starts swirling around in a green vortex. It's actually a screen in there too! You push the dome and it drops you a hint, push it again and it'll tell you what the hint was describing.<br /><br />We played a few rounds of this game and so far are just addicted! Very fun to play and they did an amazing job at it! The case looks amazing, the board looks amazing, the sound effects, real screen under the dome is amazing, just everything about this is great! The white dice are kinda on the cheap side, they don't even have indentions on them and the dots are kind of off centered. BUT dice are cheap, we just replaced them with a set we had laying around, problem solved! The game itself and how amazing the effects are far outweigh my complaints about basic white dice that are cheap to replace!<br /><br />Overall I'm truly just blown away by this game!! My only feedback to the company is that they should offer a more premium wood cased one as a deluxe or special edition! People would buy it, I promise you! Thanks for bringing this bit of our childhood back to us, this game truly puts us back to the time when the first Jumanji movie came out! Rock on 90s kids!",

Many cheaper cars lose range after a few short feet.<br /><br />Overall, super impressed with these for their price point and what they are!",

Within a minute it went crazy and stopped responding and flew into the house, shattering 2 of the blades. We replaced those and tried again only to have it go unresponsive and run into our patch of sunflower stalks where it continued to run into my sunflowers cutting at them and after a few seconds of that it managed to burn up one of it's motors!<br /><br />So we got a replacement and charged it and took it to the park. Within a couple minutes it went haywire and started flying at people when we weren't touching anything and it wouldn't let us land it or anything.

    "text": "Not happy about this one at all! I gave it 2 stars because it was fun to see how you make gum but once we were done it all had to go in the trash because no one that tried it enjoyed it. The flavor kind of hits your mouth for a brief second and then nothing... It's just bitter tasting after. I think if they could work out a longer lasting flavor it'd be that much better and maybe a formula that didn't use so much corn syrup too.<br /><br />So if you read all that and still want to try it yourself, the only other thing you'll need is wax paper for the wrappers. It comes with little stickers but you have to cut out your own wrappers if you want em. I'd also recommend using plastic disposable utensils as the gum is HARD to get off of metal utensils.<br /><br />That's my 2 cents on this kit. We weren't impressed but if you want to see how gum is made then go for it!",

It's pretty awful and you're better off shaking the tube yourself. The whole thing wobbles when you go to spin it too.

The seems welds are strong and do not tear apart like some other reviews have said.  The individual pockets are slightly oversized, which is actually kind of nice because your sports cards slide right into the pockets.<br /><br />However, these are not comparable to Ultra Pro Platinum.  Of course they aren't.  If you buy a box of 400 of these, that works out to be $0.09 per page.  Ultra Pro Platinum pages are between $0.20 and $0.22.  so these pages are half the price.  You should not expect them to be the same durability as UP Platinum.<br /><br />But overall, these pages provide great protection for cards and at $0.09 per page are a great value.  If you store sports cards in binders and 9 pocket pages, these are the highest quality at the lowest price you will find.  I would recommend you at least give them a try.  But if superior durability and protection is what you are after, then you probably want to pay the higher price and go with UP Platinum.",
