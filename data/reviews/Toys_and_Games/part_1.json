    "text": "I purchased several of these for my granddaughters for Xmas & they absolutely love them. In fact so do their brothers. Lol. Be aware that there are tiny magnets in them so that you can perch the ppl onto the animals & keep them there. I almost didn't buy them bc of that given all the news stories about kids and magnets, but the magnets are INSIDE the toys. So as long as ur kids aren't eating their toys you should be okay, but be careful around your pets so that the pets don't try to eat them.  My grandkids adore all things Schleich as do I bc I bought it for their parents too decades ago.  Schleich is well made & lasts forever.",

The plastic is extremely hard & not pliable at all.  Not sure yet if I will order a replacement or not. It's for an older child, but he has younger siblings.  It's cute. I haven't got it running yet bc it doesn't come with batteries so that's next. As it arrived broken it's definitely  going back.  It could be an awesome product if made with better materials though.",

Well, she loved it.  Its the whole furbish experience I guess, and I caught myself talking to it too.  There are sites on the internet where you can print out words in furbish, which you can learn while its learning english.  And it must be taken care of or it will get very mad.  Her furby actually went 'comatose' on her.  Thank goodness there are furbish sites that can explain all reasons these things happen.  Furby had to be opened up and worked on to revive.  Learn where the reset button is.  She still plays with it every day.  Great present.",

Thank goodness he fell asleep prior to the time he had to leave, so his parents were able to pry him from this, lol. My daughter in law called me yesterday to tell me that all her son keeps saying is 'Memaw bike?' Needless to say, they will back next weekend. I am so happy I got this set. This will make a wonderful Christmas/holiday gift for the toddler in your life.",

You are able to fill in your own answers, which easily could get a little off color, if it was just left up to the adults.

We had an absolute blast with loads of laughs while playing this (from the youngest to the oldest). Yes, there are a lot of pieces (so you need to keep tabs on them so they don't get lost) and I agree with one of the other reviewers who stated that the shark itself will probably not last for years by any means (takes a lot of abuse). But overall, I have to recommend this game to all. I also like that as my grand daughter gets a year or so older, we can modify the play to help accommodate her skills/capability. This would make a wonderful gift under the tree this year for the youngster in your life. And the box, with the exposed shark, is really cool and will gain the attention of any youngster for sure.",

Hours of fun, and she squealed with delight when I turned on the horsie and the lights started. Great present for the girl in your life.

My 14 month old grandson spent hours on the first day playing with this. He loves the music, the interaction and the colorful pieces. He is still at the stage of putting things in his mouth but these 'coins' are totally safe and cannot be swallowed. I love that he is just starting to speak and I can see trying to say the word 'uno' on the second stage of this. This bank is a smart toy and teaches children coordination, colors and sounds.

It is better, in my opinion, than a bicycle for first time kids on wheels. Low to the ground, great wheel stability and easy for kids to maneuver. If there was any downside at all (and I don't think it's a big deal) is that it can be a bit noisy. Let's put it this way, with my Sophie going down the sidewalk, no one will not notice or hear her coming. I guess that's a good thing. Bicycles have rubber tires, this has plastic wheels and on cement or even hardwood floors, it can be a little annoying.

The colors are vibrant, the pieces are sturdy and the finished picture is breathtaking and definitely framable (if you are into doing that with your puzzles).

They provide paint for the tiles, but in order to escape the paint mess - I used a very large set of colored permanent ink pens (national brand starts with an S) and they worked perfectly!  Way less mess.  The magnets are stick on and seem to hold. I am a little worried because of the textured backs of the ceramic tiles that the sticky part of the selfstick magnets may give over time, but we shall see.  They are actual ceramic tiles meant to be used with grout - so they have a waffle texture to the backs.  The front of the tiles are smooth, an ivory shimmer to them.

I was very surprised to see all the expensive gifts they received and yet, these doodle boards were the hit of the day.  The boards come with coin batteries and a tiny screwdriver to replace when necessary.  You doodle on the board and then there is an easy button to hit to reset.  There is even a 'lock' switch if you don't want to accidentally erase your art.  There are stickers to personalize and decorate the back of your doodle if you choose.  I purchased a blue one and a green one - the stickers were different one had stickers with a dinosaur theme, the other was a wild animal theme.  (I actually went back and order a pink one for myself after experiencing theirs and the stickers were sealife).  As you use the stylus- you will see a multicolored line.  You can use your fingernail - but the stylus works the best.  Honestly, it's hours and hours of peaceful, relaxing, EASY fun.  The screen is about 8x10\" ish.  Basically all plastic.  So far, so good.  Nice to know you don't have to spend 100s of dollars to have something really fun to play with.

Definitely set up with towel under your work area because you WILL drop the beads and forms as you're working on them and after about 20 times picking up everything up off the floor, you'll want to figure out a way to keep the beads on a non-floor surface.  They do come with envelopes and seals if you intend to gift them.  Oh, and they include a tiny tube of glue to put on the rubber tips - you will NEED to do this on ALL the tips if you want them to stay on.  Another think I noticed is that if I would have 6 finished, I would have been short 4 rubber tips - which would have rendered the last snowflake - garbage.  If you can't tip the ends, the beads don't stay on. So, the rubber tips are SUPER important.  There were plenty of beads to stretch your artistic wings.  But count your rubber tips first so you will know how many you can actually make.  Eh.  I would not recommend this kit based on the missing pieces and the broken wire of one snowflake.

    "text": "I was disappointed when I received this kitty.... one... the sewing job is really rough - her fur doesn't match all over.  Her face is way too dark - you cannot see her blue eyes as a result.  NO whiskers!  Her face is pushed in... so she looks deformed in a way.  The head/face is hard formed as mentioned in their ad.  Her left ear won't stay forward, was got crushed and stored (I am guessing) in a crushed position and so now it thinks it should stay flat and inside out. Further, on the ears... they are not pointed at the tips as they should and shown in ad photos - they are actually rounded which gives her more of a panther look.  Eh.  She is about the size of a young siamese cat in life... I was really hoping she'd look more real - but the flaws are so bad that isn't a possibility.  Its a real shame they didn't make sure the fur matched and at least gave her some whiskers!",

He received a pile of gifts - some very extravagant, however the little reversible octo was his favorite of all - just goes to show you, it's not the amount of money you spend.  His 8 year old brother then wanted one.  So, I ordered these for the Easter baskets from gramma.  The only thing I will say is that the bunnies came with the \"mad\" face out - ears were talk and perked - when you versed to the happy face, the ears are crumpled and floppy.  Wish they would have put the happy face out ward.  I have reversed them and hope the ears will straighten and perk up a bit. The colors are bright - the fur is super soft.  It does take a bit of stuffing to get them reversed but still really cute.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",

It might be more expensive to buy a \"pro\" bubble machine... but unless you want to post someone to stand there and keep refilling it... *EH*  It went right into the dumpster.  Partly because in an attempt to \"enlarge\" the soap capacity, my husband destroyed it.  All in frustration.  In any case... if you want more than 1 minute of bubbles, go for the more expensive, larger capacity machines.  If you are into the bubbles 1 minute at a time... this the machine for you.  I never look forward to posting negative reviews.. but sometimes to be honest, it must be done.<br />UPDATE:  12/5/2018 ... I wish I could rate this ZERO stars...

While I could use the center bar to turn the tabs to the open setting, I was not able to lift them out without the tip of a pair of scissors.  That may be a good thing to make it a bit difficult to get into?? It is a thick, smooth plastic. There are no moving parts (other than the openings tabs). It looks like a cartoony car in my opinion. It's not huge, but it takes a pretty good foot print - one of my pics has a ruler so you can get an idea of the actual size.  I should say it's fairly heavy too, even without coins.

My 5 year old grandson likes to line them up to make long drop overs... he is not really into playing actual dominoes but maybe some day. In the mean time, these are beautiful and should last for years.  They come with a lovely heavy duty zippered case that will definitely help them survive longer.  I would recommend them.

I use it for my 5 year old grandson when he comes to spend the night.  There is actually room for two small adults - or 3 or 4 small kids sitting, sleeping about 2 kids. The door area is a see through mesh.  There are side vents that are mesh as well.  The material is extremely thin... so I don't really think it would be good outside... it's really an indoor thing in my personal opinion - and since that's how I use it, it's perfect.  Now, I just have to learn the trick of twist.  Once I do, there is an elastic band that keeps in place. It is red (kind of a deep orangish red) and black.  It arrived quickly (I have prime) and in good condition.  I never hesitate to update my reviews if new info would seem useful.<br />UPDATE:  1/22/2017...  Ok.. a helpful hint... its a good idea to keep the &#34;directions&#34; sheet.  My husband studied it for quite a while and then came up with a way to teach me.  Ha!  It works for me to put it on a bed (like a spare set of hands)...pull the ends together (making sort of a taco) and then you sort of twist that and it VIOLE!  It fits back into the bag.  My best advice?  Do NOT give up!!  :)",

I've ordered this type of coin for our games for years... they don't last forever and eventually you have to replace them, but that's after a few years... so I am ok with that.

One is this one.. the &#34;FurReal&#34; brand and the other was a &#34;Joy&#34; brand... the cats looked nearly identical, however, the other brand - $25.00 cheaper was significantly better.  This one sounds horribly mechanical, jerky - almost looks like the cat is having a seizure.  One eye is bright and shiny, the other is dull and scratched.... In order to get the cat out of the box I had to literally destroy the box, otherwise, it would totally be going back - in a second.  I'm disappointed to say the least.  Even the fur was nicer on the Joy brand! The FurReal brand also did not &#34;go to sleep&#34; either... it was constantly moving - (I see a LOT of batteries being used). The meow sound is very odd and fake. Honestly, if you really think you need to purchase a robo pet - try the Joy brand.  It was more real and smooth in movement... the meow, still fake, was sweeter... you could actually feel the purr... and it seemed to be more interactive.  It's not perfect either, but a better buy and more satisfying experience.<br />I always update my reviews if new info would be useful -however, not being able to return this was an expensive donation item - so unlikely there will be much more to report.  :(",

She is silent until you get your ear directly over her... then it sounds like really purring.  She is delightful.  Even my husband thought she was adorable.  I have serious pet allergies and this seemed like a little comfort without the allergic reaction. I am surprised at how realistic it looks and feels.  Now, you won't really want to &#34;cuddle&#34; her.... she is a bit stiff, particularly on the bottom.  But you could hold her in your lap and pat her.  She comes with a lovely pet bed, a wooden backed brush and the cardboard box she comes in converts into a pet carrier if you'd like.  There is an adoption form to fill out if you'd like.  She takes 1 D cell battery... and yes, the battery box is screwed down. There is a slight chemically odor when you first open it.. but it dissipates quickly. Didn't notice within a few hours of opening.  I included a video so you can get a better feel for it.  I feel like it was worth every penny!

While I still like my little kitty, she has developed a &#34;mechanical sound&#34; while &#34;breathing&#34;.... too bad.... wishing wishing wishing the quality was better.  When I get annoyed by the sound I have to take the battery out... as others have said, an on and off switch would be preferable than screw down battery case. Just a little disappointed.<br />UPDATE: 10/30/2016.... I have had this little kitty for a couple of months and she is still going - no battery changes yet.  The &#34;mechanical sound&#34; sort of comes and goes... My 5 year old grandson is really enamored of her.  He brushes her and coos to her that she is &#34;sooo cute.&#34;  So.  That's worth it, right?  It is oddly soothing to have it just sitting there... &#34;breathing.&#34;  I do wish there was an on and off switch and the quality would allow quiet, non mechanical sounds...and maybe softer so you could actually snuggle it.",

    "text": "purchased for my grandsons to use when visiting..... it is large.... large enough for an an adult to get into.  The material is a cotton canvas... not terribly thick, but not too thin in my opinion.  It was relatively easy to put together... I like that this is a bottom floor attached.  It is quite popular to stay grandma's and camp out.... I added some &#34;nap pads&#34; which are perfect for the 5 and 2 year old.  I also added a stuffed bear and alligator and a camp lantern that is a lantern or a star map night light.  Honestly, I keep it up in the corner of my living room so it is ready for any visit. It does come with a handy bag that has a handle if you'd like to store it when not in use.  The poles are wood... a pine I believe... very sturdy.  I would recommend this teepee...  I always update if there are any issues that may be helpful.<br />3/25/2016 UPDATE:  ...so I just finished deconstructing the teepee and felt an undate with tips might be helpful... first... you will never get the canvas teepee back into the canvas bag provided... it's like folding/rolling a really thick fitted sheet and trying to get into a tube sock.... BUT the wooden poles fit nicely into the canvas bag along with the plastic connector pieces... it would have been nice if the connectors gripped the poles better and stayed connected during the deconstruct phase... however... I just removed all the holed top pieces and then turned the teepee upside down and shook it sort of like a pillow case... the lower pieces eventually come out...  I just rolled the teepee up, put all the poles and connector pieces in the bag and set in a large drawer I have.  I would have lowered my rating one star for the deconstruct hassle, but honestly, my grandsons love it so much I just can't. The quality is such that this is going to last for many years if we take care of it.  It's just a matter of learning how to use it in an efficient manner.  Also... I have hard wood floors, so I went to a local carpet store and purchased some carpet padding.  I cut into a circle and place it under the teepee when I have it set up... I worry less about bonked heads that way - grandsons 5 years and 2 years.  Ok!  Hope this is indeed helpful info!",

You can play with 2 or 20.  Moves quickly so you don't get bored. There are several variations available... travel... &#34;spicy&#34;....&#34;pirate&#34;...etc... Any are fun and for the low price I would recommend throwing the dice and giving it a try! :)  It arrived quickly (we have prime) and in good condition.",

I found this one... No reviews... I admit, I was scared... plus I worried about the knobby bouncy ball... but EUREKA!!  It works!!  Listen it lights up and eventually it will die as the batteries are not replaceable... but WHO CARES? You can STILL skip it!  I am LOVING this.  Wish I was still as young and bouncy as I used to be 40 years ago... but I adored it then and now. I just can't do it for hours like I used to...and I'm a bit slower.  :)  I'm pretty sure this counts as exercise and it's fun!  Of course, mine is covered in sand cause I skip on the wide open beach.  If you were a fan of the original, you'll find this amusing and it works! I'm getting two more... one for my sister (else she WILL steal mine) and one for the house that isn't covered with sand.  :)  You do need a pretty good size area that is clear... but it works on floors or carpets and sand of course. I'm pretty sure people think it's very amusing to see an old, fat lady skipping down the beach. HA!<br />The loop is plenty big enough to slip over your shoe... 5 1/2&#34; diameter on the side of the plastic ankle loop... the cord is tube covered (this is REALLY important because otherwise the cord just wraps around your ankle and you can't &#34;skip it&#34;).... the ball is attached to cord very well... I yanked on it... stood and pulled... obviously more than you need to do... but I wanted to test it.<br />You don't get to pick your color... doesn't bother me.

Assembly of this product was so painstaking, I ended up having a couple of dented finger nails, some splinters, and a bunch of broken and scratched up skin.  This item requires a lot of finger strength, yet it requires gentle assembly.  There are certain parts during assembly where it requires me to gently slide in one part, yet push it in with force.  the longitudinal wood pieces came in 12 pieces, but to assemble, it must fit into 5 different slots.  I broke about 9 little slots in 9 difference pieces.  The instructions were all pictures, but certain parts of the instruction must be studied in detail!!!  I studied certain steps and was confident; turned out, I was wrong and had to break it apart which caused more broken wooden pieces.  The last part, one of the pieces didn't come fully cut, so when I pushed a piece in, it snapped.  Overall, if this item I assembled was not examined in detail, nobody would see any of the cracks.  I like what I assembled and it did turn out great, but I refuse to ever do this again!<br /><br />and it wont turn!

A few of these slap bracelets wouldn't snap into a circle when slapped.  A few of them were not properly sealed so I was able to see what was inside of the slap bracelet.  There were a couple that just came with the outer piece/shell without anything inside so it was just a limp piece of plastic.  A bunch of them were badly printed or badly cut so that I was able to see another color irrelevant to the actual one.  Please see all photos as reference.  There was a decent amount to pass out, but if you're planning to pass out to exactly 108 kids,  a good quarter or a third of the kids would be very disappointed.  Luckily, the director lied and most of the kids didn't show up to claim these \"trick\"-or-\"treats\".",

This item literally arrived today and it's going back and I'm ordering a different reborn style doll from another vendor possibly in hopes of better quality. This item was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 6 year old daughter who is asking Santa for a baby doll that looks real.

Once it settles, is a nice clear putty. Once you play with it a bit it clouds up, I guess from the heat of your hand? But goes back to clear once you put it down.

It will take a lot of patients and a place you can use to put together that doesn't have to be moved. The pieces are very easy lost because they are so small. I'm retired and it took 2 weeks to complete. It looks adorable when finished and when the lights are turned on their a nice touch. By the way, my hair wasn't gray before starting this project. Ha.

    "text": "These seem like good quality and the colors are nice and seem accurate.  I was concerned that the horns of the moose might be sharp and could hurt a child if they fell on the toy, but no worries here; the horns are soft and bendable.  If you tried to bend them much, they might break off though.  The price seems reasonable.  If you buy them to teach your children about these animals, there is one problem.  The racoon and fox are over half the size of the moose, so the proportions are all wrong.  The fox and racoon are about the right size in relation to each other, but next to the moose, the grouping looks strange.  Looks like we an have incredibly large mutant fox and racoon or incredibly small mutant moose.  I noticed there are other groupings available in this brand and I would have paired the moose with maybe a bear and a deer.  Then put the fox and racoon with another animal about their size.  The package contains only one small paragraph about the 3 animals, so this is not an educational toy by any stretch of the imagination.  Smaller, younger kids probably won't care about any educational benefit anyway or the size proportions of the animals, so this may not be a big deal.  As a kid, I would have loved a set like this.  I suppose a smart kid would pick up on the size discrepancy if they have ever been to a zoo and seen some of these animals or seen a TV program that showed the sizes.",

The included helicopter is supposed to carry Thomas off to safety after he escapes the shark, but obviously that's something that occurs only in a child's imagination.  The helicopter is just an extra included toy and can stand alone.  It's not a bad toy and the engine is cute and well made.

    "text": "What kid doesn't like dinosaurs?  This is perfert for your boy or girl who is into dinosaurs.  I suppose it could be considered an educational toy, but probably only marginally so.  Who says educational toys can't be fun too?  This is especially nice for a kid interested in archeology.  Contains a block of plaster that has embedded into it &#34;DNA&#34; stickers and a glow in the dark dinosaur.  After the fun of digging out the dinosaur and stickers with the included digging tools and brush, they are left with a dinosaur model, so even though the digging fun is over after one time (if they do it all at once), there is something to show for it.  There are also two &#34;augmented reality&#34; (AR) play mats that are completed with the DNA stickers that have been &#34;excavated&#34;.  The mats when used with a cell phone and an application from the App Store (for Apple phones) or the Google Play Store (for Androids) produces a 3D dinosaur, visible on the phone.  One problem with this is that it might not work with all cell phones.  It is supposed to work with MOST Apple devices (8.0 and above).  On Android phones the only devices tested are Google Nexus Series, Samsung Galaxy S5 and Samsung Galaxy Tab.  I didn't have a cell phone to test this on, but it seems like it still might be fun even if that part doesn't work.  It's just that you might not be able to use the full capability of the kit if your phone doesn't work with the application.  Also if you give this to a child of only 8 (the lower age limit on this), they may not yet have a cell and you may not want them to have one at that age.  Since this contains many small parts, it needs to be kept away from small children, as there is a choking hazard (box says no one under 3).  I would have loved a toy like this when I was a kid.  Just remember to put down a newspaper when they are working on the plaster block in order to collect all the plaster pieces that are chipped off as they excavate.  Pricing of the kit is very reasonable.  Made in China.",

    "title": "VERY NICE DETAIL; WELL-CONSTRUCTED; MOLDED IN SEVERAL COLORS; GREAT FOR KIDS WHO LIKE HORSES",
    "text": "This is a really cute set good sized set (roughly 18 inches long and 4 inches high) made of rugged plastic and with real rubber tires.  The truck looks realistic with nice details inside the cab with a center console, two bucket seats, a dashboard and a steering wheel.  It is molded in 4 colors plus a clear plastic windshield, sunroof and back window.  The side doors have no windows.  The steering wheel turns, but is not functional for turning the wheels.  The two front doors of the truck both open.  The hood of the truck opens to reveal an engine.  Nice detail including non-functioning headlights, parking lights, front grill, side mirrors, gas cap and a rear tailgate that also opens.  The only assembly required on the truck is putting on the 4 tires, which should be easy for just about any kid.  The horse trailer also requires putting on 4 tires and a special wheel in the front; also there are 6 trailer pieces that have to be snapped in place. An illustrated book shows how to install the pieces.  Pretty easy, but a younger child might have a little trouble figuring it out.  The pictures on the side of the trailer and the license plates on the truck and trailer are provided in a sheet of stickers, which a child can place where they like.  Includes a completely black horse with a blanket, 2 figures (a driver for the truck and a handler for the horse) and several accessories for the horse including a bridle, halter, saddle, a couple brushes, a bale of hay and a bunch of carrots.  Suitable for both boys or girls, especially those who like horses.  Probably this toy would be preferred by girls since the truck is pink and the horse handler is female. Even some adult collectors might like this set as it is colorful, detailed and well made. The real downside that I see to this set is that if you have very young children who will be around this, they could easily put one of the small pieces in their mouth and choke.  There is no instructions on showing how to use the horse accessories; most are obvious, but a couple are not.  The most important thing to know is that this is more of an &#34;old school&#34; type of toy; no batteries, no motors, no remotes.  A lot of kids today want the latest electronic devices and radio controlled toys, but this toy allows them to use their imaginations a little. I think that's a plus, but if you buy this for the kid who wants a cell phone instead, there will be a level of disappointment, I'm sure.  Note that this is made by a German company, with components from Germany, China, Romania and Tunisia. It's not that important to me where it is made, but it might be to you.  Note too that you can also buy other items in this series, such as a barn type structure, a corral and other horses.  If your child insists on other components, it could get expensive, if you give in.  As a kid at heart, I like this toy a lot myself and would keep it if I didn't have so many other things.  It will probably go to a grandson.",

    "text": "My great-grandson liked this a lot and really enjoyed riding it.  He's not a large kid, but is one year older than the recommended ages for the toy.  He is within the weight limit, which I think is 50 pounds or under.  He can probably enjoy it for about a year, but he was almost too big for it now so you probably don't want to get this for a child who is approaching the upper age limit, which I think the box said was 5.  Also, if you have a big child close to the maximum age and maximum weight, they might not fit the toy.  At around a $200 price, I consider this to be a luxury toy and you might be able to find toys for a lot less that would be just as much fun for a kid.  I recommend getting it for kids at the lower end of the age range (2 or 3), so they can enjoy it for a few years before they outgrow it.  Of course you can always donate it when they do outgrow it.  Not much to assemble on it and the few parts that need to be put on are easy to install.  The only real downside to this toy is the initial charge time of 18 hours.  Kids are impatient (some adults are too) and if you present this to them and then they find out they can't use it until the next day, there could be some disappointment.  Of course that could be a way to teach patience too.  After the initial overnight charge, the battery seemed to last quite well, so they should be able to enjoy a driving session until they lose interest and a recharge is needed.  This is not huge, but it is a large item that you need a storage place for and a place to plug it in while it is charging.  As several reviewers have said, this works better on hard surfaces.  This doesn't move very fast, but fast enough for younger kids; older kids might find it too slow.  Obviously too, as a kid gets older they might not find a toy like this that &#34;cool&#34;.  Since this is a motorized riding toy, obviously you do need to supervise a kid while riding it, especially younger ones; don't buy it if you think you are going to turn your kid loose with it and not have to watch them.  You need adequate space in your house or a big driveway to use this, as you probably don't want the kids driving it in the street, unless you live in a very low traffic residential area and/or are right beside them when they are using it.  Probably best for use on sidewalks or a fenced yard if you are going to use it outside.  Keep in mind too that if you go any great distance away from your house and the charge runs out, you now have a 50 pound toy to somehow get home.  How noisy a toy is also can be a factor on whether you want to get it or not; this runs reasonably quiet, which is a plus.  A fun toy for the appropriately aged small child.",

I had a lot of trouble getting the walls to stay glued and fitting them together properly.  The parts have to be washed with soap and water before they will stick, but even that didn't help much  I switched super glues and had a little better luck.  You need cyanoacrylate glue to glue the metal pieces together.<br /><br />The picture of the model on the box cover is decorated by a professional modeler or artists, so depending on how skillful you are, your results might not be as good.<br /><br />I think this is marketed as a toy, but it's not a toy.  It's designed for people who want to spend some time building and custom painting a model railroad structure.<br /><br />Both the advantage and disadvantage of this kit is that you can custom paint it any way you like.  That's more work than kits that are cast or molded in multiple colors, but looks more like you built it, than coming from a kit that anyone can buy and build.<br /><br />For the high price that Woodland Scenics charges for their kits, it would be nice if they would include basic paint colors in the kit or at least include the information on what paints to buy and techniques for painting and weathering.  I was able to e-mail the company and they quickly and generously supplied the info, but one shouldn't have to ask.  It should be a part of the kit.<br /><br />It's hard to beat the realistic look of these kits, but it does require some time and skill to build and decorate to get the look you want.<br /><br />This kit is not really worth the money, since it is so small and requires so much work to get it looking good.",

It is a doll that is meant to be played with.  The pretend scissors look pretty safe and do move back and forth and make a clicking sound.  The water squirt bottle might be okay for some kids, but I know some kids would be using it to squirt someone with, instead of the doll's hair, so use your own judgment on that.  At least it only holds a few ounces of water or whatever you put in it.  Some kids I know would probably put soda in it and be squirting it into their mouths!  The doll does have a really full head of hair, so those children who enjoy it, will probably have fun combing the hair and styling it and using one of 3 barrettes.  Educational value for grooming?--maybe a little, but this is not an educational toy.  The dress the doll wears is cute, with a pink poodle on it.  I really don't think you can go wrong with this doll as a gift for young children who like dolls, even if they don't care that much about the grooming aspect.  The eyes are painted on and don't look realistic to me, but at least nothing that can be broken or poked out.  The doll's skin is slightly brown and the box has Spanish wording as well as English, so could be appropriate for children of varying skin tones.",

    "text": "I was looking for a DotA / MOBA in board game format and this fits the bill pretty nicely.<br /><br />It's quite expensive and also a massively complex game. Not for the faint of heart. If you want super premium components, you get what you pay for. Comes with cases and shelves for all the components, and the art on the neoprene mats and the cards is gorgeous. I'm quite happy with it, but it's one of those \"big box\" games that you only need one or maybe two of in your entire collection.<br /><br />As a game it feels a bit different than League of Legends (as it should given the format), but it's just something to be aware of and expect. I had been designing my own DotA board game and it's not exactly what I had in mind, but it's definitely fun.<br /><br />The biggest drawback is the learning time and the playing time. I wouldn't even consider doing more than 2 players unless everyone in the group had already played several 2 player games and knew the rules well. It could really benefit from simultaneous turns and I'll be thinking up some house rules for sure to make the playthroughs not take quite so long.<br /><br />The races are pretty asymmetric which some people might not like. You need to learn one race and stick with it. The complexity is far too big to bounce around and try each race in turn. Each race's choice of minions, spires, heroes, and faction upgrades has a LOT of different options and it could be pretty overwhelming at first. Learning all the different abilities, how they work, and figuring out how to work that into your strategy and gameplay.",

What more can you ask for?<br /><br />You build parks and enclosures to house dinosaurs. The dinosaurs are hungry. If you can't feed them, they'll still eat - guess what? - your other dinosaurs! Very well made and lots of fun. If you don't like this game, maybe board games aren't your thing.<br /><br />I look at this game as an example to understand how to make games well. I think anyone who likes board games has to give at least one Tiny Epic game a try, and this is the one I would recommend most.<br /><br />Limited closet space? Desperate for something besides Monopoly, Risk, or Settlers of Catan? Like building games with dire consequences? Think dinosaurs are the least bit cool or interesting? Look no further.<br /><br />My only minor criticism is that some might consider it complex with the different special dinosaurs and some of the rules about how and when to place dinos. Any board game is going to have a learning curve, and this one is small.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a wonderful thinking game, this is an excellent purchase to get started. It comes with a Go instruction booklet as well, which hits all the high points of gameplay without being too long or boring. If you read your way through the entire book (about 20 illustrated pages) you will be well on your way to understanding most aspects of the game.<br /><br />Several tips to note about this board:<br /><br />It has 9x9 grid on one side and 13x13 on the other, which makes it the perfect board for beginners or those learning Go. These smaller sizes are normally used by less experienced players to learn the basics of the game, without being overwhelmed by the length of a full 19x19 match. A 9x9 game, depending on how long the players take to think about their moves, will take about 10 to 20 minutes, and a 13x13 game takes about 20 to 40 minutes.<br /><br />The wood is spruce and is very good quality for a beginner's board. I have not used it for very long so I don't know how long it would take the lines on the board to wear off or show signs of use. However, it's still in pristine quality from when I bought it, and I've used it quite thoroughly. Any dust or dirt can be easily wiped off with a dry or slightly damp cloth (it comes with instructions on how to care for the board).<br /><br />Of primary consideration is the quality of the Go stones that come with this board. If you don't have any stones, this is also a great purchase because the stones are rust-proof and will never crack, break, or corrode. They are nice and big, so they are easy to hold and become used to playing Go with. Another plus is that it comes with enough stones for a 19x19 game, so if you later choose to purchase a full sized board, you'll have enough stones to play with.<br /><br />Overall, a great purchase if you want to jump into learning how to play Go.",

This 1 is very light wood and very well made. And since it's for puzzles you have to put it together. .... Pretty smart. I would advise every puzzle lover to get one of these.

    "text": "As a child I was a huge fan of Legos and had dozens of sets… Ranging from castles to pirates.<br />However, they've been sitting in boxes in the basement for the last 30 years… When I happen to discover Lego‘s new botanical collection at the botanical garden, I had to buy for nostalgia value.<br /><br />The first thing I immediately noticed is the boxes are much harder to open… I actually had to look on YouTube for how to open it without destroying the box. (hint: run a butter knife along the edge to loosen the glue). Once I got it out of the box, it is self-explanatory, with components labeled in four separate bags and an assembly tool.<br /><br />It took me around two hours to assemble, a lot of the assembly is repetitive as you are making the same parts over and over for the base, stems, and flowers.<br /><br />The base is highly interesting as it looks very simple from the outside, but it's made of rotating parts inside in different colors.<br /><br />The flower stems can be arranged at different heights and patterns, making it fun to customize. I loved the realistic snaking roots and Dirt toned blocks to fill in around the stems.<br /><br />I paid $50 for this from the official Lego store and don't regret it for a second; it looks fantastic on top of my Japanese tea chest and it was a lot of fun. My next challenge is a Lego bonsai!",

I was also a child when the original Stars Wars movies came out, and over the years have owned various Stars Wars merchandise like lunchboxes, toys, action figures, Viewmaster Slides, and other collectibles.<br /><br />So when I was offered the chance to test drive the LEGO Millennium Falcon, I was overjoyed.<br /><br />It had been years since I last assembled a Lego set.<br /><br />The level of detail on this is amazing - it has an opening cockpit, interior access, hidden compartments, spring-loaded external weapons and five figures including C3PO and R2D2.<br /><br />With nearly 1,400 pieces, this is not a kit for the short of patience or faint of heart, but it DOES make a fantastic project the whole family can enjoy together.<br /><br />(and if you lose / misplace the directions, you can handily download / print from Lego's official website if you search by kit number 7527).<br /><br />The perfect gift for any Star Wars fan, whether you're a child or a child at heart!",

The framing of the photo is interesting as well, with several moored boats in the foreground and the harbor in the background. The level of detail in the high-resolution photo is amazing (the finished puzzle measures 27 X 20). The puzzle pieces are sturdy (unlike some cheaper puzzles I've assembled) and nonglare.<br /><br />This is a fabulous challenge to have on hand for weekends or relaxation; the large amount of blue in the water and sky make these more difficult sections to accomplish, but the end result is well worth the effort!",

    "text": "Coming from an Irish family, I have accumulated many different types of Irish collectibles over the years: stuffed animals, Beanie Babies, glasses, books, jewelery...all with some sort of Irish theme. But until recently I didn't have any Irish dolls, porcelain or otherwise. I have been collecting Dolls of the World Barbies for a number of years, and more recently Princess of the World dolls, so I couldn't believe it when I found out that a Princess of Ireland Barbie would be made. I was nervous that the doll wouldn't \"feel\" Irish enough. So when I received her in the mail I was pleasantly surprised that she was even more beautiful than in the photos online. Her complexion is very fair, and her auburn hair is stunning in natural light. Her green eyes are sparkling and mysterious, and she wears a very light rose eyeshadow that makes her beautiful eyes stand out even more. Her costume is sort of a medieval/Celtic blend. She wears a velvety soft forest green cloak with a golden Tara brooch clasp, a traditional Celtic design. Her dress is a crinkly olive green fabric with a stripe of Celtic designs down the middle. At her waist she wears a belt of three golden medallions with Celtic designs, and on her head, perfectly balanced atop her auburn hair, a golden crown fit for an Irish princess. The box she comes in is also perfect for displaying her in. Appropriately enough, it is green (Ireland is actually a Viking word for green) with golden trim. The backdrop inside of the box is an Irish castle. There is information about the Celts on the back of the box. This is sure to become a treasured keepsake in my family, and I'm planning on buying more for relatives and friends.",
