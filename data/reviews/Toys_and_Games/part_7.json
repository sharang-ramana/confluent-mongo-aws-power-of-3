    "title": "This Robot is FUN!!!!!",
    "text": "I cannot begin to tell you how much fun our entire family is having with this robot! (Well, almost the entire family...the cats hate it but the dog LOVES it!) I am truly impressed as to how well this toy works and all of the features it includes.  I usually mention at the end of a review my opinion as to whether an item is worth the price but I feel the need to start with that in this review.  I cannot believe how low the price of Rock Robot is. I would expected it to cost FAR more than it does!<br /><br />Other than needing place 2 AA batteries (NOT included) in the controller, there is no assembly required. The robot has an on/off button on the front and rather than using batteries, it is charged using a USB cord (included).  Charging does take a few hours but then Rock takes off, moves, dances, sings, plays, etc for a good 30-45 minutes straight before needing to be charged again.<br /><br />As soon as its turned on, Rock giggles and introduces himself.  He lights up as well.  The remote controller has a SO many different functions and works well.  We have experienced a few times when  we had to turn the robot off and back on again after using a lot of the controller functions in a short time.  (The robot will stay lit but not perform the controller functions. Its truly NOT a big deal. Turning off and back on again is all it takes and he's back in action) Rock can walk or slide; frontwards or backwards, fast/slow-pretty much whatever you want him to do.  If he's gliding and comes to a stop, he doesn't tip over! I keep thinking he's going to tip but he has not fallen over even one time!  He dances, sings and even moonwalks. He has a bunch of stories to tell as well with the simple press of a button. The volume as well as the voice is easily controlled with the controller.<br /><br />The gesture sensing function is pretty neat. A simple command using your hand will make Rock move backward or forward/left or right.<br /><br />Rock appears to be well-made. As mentioned, he hasn't fallen over once. It glides/walks/dances, etc VERY easily on flooring. (Rock does not work well on thick carpet) The controller is easy to use as well.  I feel the need to mention my husband has a hearing impairment and cannot always understand what the robot is saying-he has trouble making out the words. However, the rest of us can understand it perfectly fine.<br /><br />We truly are having a blast playing with this robot.  I cannot recommend it enough. Its fun and entertaining and WOW, is the price ever incredibly LOW!",

    "title": "Fun For Cats AND Humans!/**REVISED REVIEW! NEW INFORMATION/CHANGE TO RATING",
    "text": "Late last year, for a week or so, all 3 of our cats sat gathered around the stove in the kitchen just staring at it. I quickly figured that was probably NOT a good sign-that we likely had an uninvited guest in our home. A few days later, I was proven correct.  Got up early one morning to take the dog out and there was  a dead mouse by the front door waiting to greet me, with 2 of the 3 cats sitting close by, proud of what they had left for me. (I don't think I've ever screamed louder in my entire life than I did that morning! lolol-I did heap praise on them after I calmed down)  Unfortunately, the cats were once again gathered around the stove watching...and a few days later, mouse #2  was waiting for us to clean up. (Thank God I didn't find that one)<br /><br />As soon as I saw this cat toy, I immediately ordered it.  Though one of our 3 cats who helped catch the mice has since gone to the Rainbow Bridge, I knew the other 2, Miss Piggy and Squeaky, would have loads of fun playing with this toy. (And if I'm being honest, I want to keep them in tip-top shape in case any further 'uninvited guests' find their way into our home! lol) The mouse (I see it more of a rat than a mouse) is nearly 11 inches long from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail.  It has beady red eyes that light up.  From a distance, I believe people (who don't know its fake) could mistaken it for a real mouse (rat).  It has gray fur and what appears to be sharp teeth sticking out of its mouth. (The teeth are NOT sharp, they only appear that way) The mouse takes 3 AAA batteries (not included) and the remote controller takes 2 AAA batteries as well. (not included)  The only assembly required is placing the batteries in the mouse and controller. A nice, small screwdriver comes with the toy, something I especially appreciate! (Works on my eyeglass hinges as well!) The controller allows you to move the mouse forward and backward. (Both of our young kids were able to operate the remote control without issue while we stood with them) It does work on carpet but works far better on flooring.  As soon as we turned it on and began steering it around the room, 2 cats immediately popped out of their beds, their curiosity piqued.  Both cats watched the mouse zip around the floor for a bit.  As soon as it got close to Miss Piggy, she jumped and ran under the bed. lol.  But Squeaky...he was far braver than Piggy and watched it up close.  We'd stop it for awhile and he'd creep closer and closer to it, staring at it....and then we'd start it up again. lol.  It was loads of fun to watch him with this toy.  It certainly kept him entertained for quite some time! Piggy stayed hidden but she's a nosy cat...she'll get the hang of it before long.<br /><br />This is a fun toy not only for cats but for cat owners to operate for their cats! We had loads of fun watching the cat's reaction.  Its a great way for your cat to get some exercise as well.  Very easy to operate also!<br /><br />UPDATE******************<br /><br />We got this out again tonight to play with. This time, the dog had more fun chasing it than the cats. However, after just under 15 minutes of use, it stopped working entirely!  Even though I had used brand new batteries in the mouse and the controller when I first got it (a day ago), I replaced all 5 batteries.  It does NOT work at all.  Nothing happened to it. It did not fall, it didn't' crash, it was not damaged in any way, it simply stopped working altogether in the blink of an eye. And that's a darn shame because my cat AND dog had fun with it. Due to the fact that it stopped working entirely after just under 30 minutes of total use since we got it, and the fact we did nothing to break it/make it stop working, I've changed my rating/review of this item.  I cannot recommend an item that stops working out of the blue as this did.  For the minutes that it did work, my pets loved it.  And we loved watching them have fun.",

After we painted our magnets and let them dry, we finished by decorating them with the stickers as well. (also included in the kit)  My granddaughter is on the younger side but these kits were wonderful. They both held her attention and she was SO proud of her work.

She had NO problem at all!  We had a wonderful time painting our butterfly magnets a variety of colors and later (after they dried) decorating them with stickers that were included.  It may sound odd, but the paintbrush was the perfect size for my granddaughter's small hands. The paint (included) colors were so bright and perfect for butterflies!  She was so VERY proud of her artwork and had fun handing out her magnets to family members.  We had fun and WILL be doing this again in the near future!  I can't wait for our next crafts day!",

I'm positive that all of the animal sounds and the 10 songs will keep him engaged and entertained! I also really appreciate the auto-off feature! We go through so many batteries in all of the grand kids' toys that it's awesome when a toy is able to shut itself off to preserve battery power! Just one more thing I wanted to include: there is no mention of a weight limit either here in the online description or on/in the item packaging. My grandson is on the hefty side so I am hoping this play mat survives his stomping for awhile, which is why I thought I'd mention it in my review. If we do have problems with it, I will update my review! But overall, I would recommend this set (and already have!).",

Ideal Girls Toy Age 6-8) for my 11 yr old granddaughter. She has discovered journaling and scrap-booking in the last year so I've been on the lookout for a gift that would harness these hobbies. This set is perfect! Everything is designed and constructed well and the set is age appropriate for the target age group of 8-13 -- the kit isn't too childish/basic (unicorns and rainbows) but also not too grown-up/adult. I expect my granddaughter to love this and would recommend it as a gift for any girl age 8-13!",

    "text": "This little game was a surprisingly huge hit in our family! The box itself is constructed extremely well. It sits flat on the table with no tipping or rocking at all. The logos, and numbers are all printed or applied well and look sharp and legible on the end product. The lid fits perfectly! The only issue we have discovered in our month of nightly use, is that all US coins (pennies, dimes and quarters) fit into and stand upright in the slots.. all except for nickles. They are simple too thick to fit. We learned this after our 3 yr old granddaughter tried to force a nickle into the #4 slot, gouging the surrounding wood in the process. This is not a big deal as my husband was able to re-router the slots to be ever so slightly wider so now all coins will fit into all slots with ease. Overall, this is a great game. Easy for all ages to play. Heck, it's a great game to have the littles play with you as they'll learn their numbers so they can place their coins. My husband and I keep this on our main table and play it at least once per evening. It's such a simply game that you can play it while having a conversation. It really takes no thought at all. We took it camping and played it when we were forced inside during a storm. Thinking of getting one to keep in the camper so we never forget it! Even grandma asked me to order one for her house so she can play with her friends! Highly recommended!",

Not too expensive, not too excessive.. just right! The cards are printed on decent card stock that took pen ink well without smudging, the words and print were all clear, legible and not smeared and the colors were bright. The included bags fit the back of the cards and the glue strips (which I didn't realize were included!) adhered to both the bags and the cards very well. I filled the bags with conversation hearts (about 15 per bag), wrote my kiddos' names on them and they were a huge hit! The order comes with enough cards, bags and glue strips to make up 40 sets. At the current price of $18, it works out to just $0.45 each.. a wonderful deal!! I live in rural Wyoming so the rustic mason jar design was perfect for me and my kiddos too! I have 8 regulars who ride every day so this purchase will last me for 4 more years! When I do run out, I will be immediately replenishing with another order (or three!!). Highly recommend!!",

    "text": "When Skip, our Pembroke Welsh Corgi, was a puppy, I got one of those basic blue kiddie wading pools for him. He loved it! Now 6 years old, he hasn't had a pool since he was a puppy (we just haven't been able to have one where we've lived in that time). This Splash Sprinkle Pad arrived Friday and we set it up today.<br /><br />Set up is extremely fast and easy. Filling it with water is what takes the most time. Once you have your hose connected and turn on your water, the water fills the outer rim (which has evenly spaced tiny holes in it) of the pool first, then once the rim is full the water will jet upward out of holes... it's those jets of water that fill the pool as they land. Once full of water, it is obviously quite heavy. The material used is quite thick and stood up to Skip's feet just fine (I did his nails about a week prior).<br /><br />It took Skip awhile to warm up to it since, like I said, he's only had a pool before. He wasn't too keen at first of the water jets (the sprinkler part of Splash Sprinkler Pad). But once I got his yard ball in the pool, he started re-thinking this new pool idea! Soon enough he was jumping in without any encouragement and playing with his ball. We were having such a fun time splashing and barking that we drew the attention of the neighbor dogs.. one even came over to check it out too! LoL<br /><br />When the fun and interest had faded, we simply disconnected the hose and stepped on the outer rim of the pool to push some water out and once enough water weight had drained out, we hung the pool on our back deck to continue to drain. Here in a little while, we will fold it up and store it away for another hot day!<br /><br />Bottom line - this is an awesome \"toy\" for your dogs (and your neighbor's dogs!) and kids! I can't wait for my grandkids to visit again. They're always asking to play in our sprinklers so this will be a fun toy to pull out for them too! It folds up well and doesn't take much storage space as well! Highly recommended! Skip's final score: 2 paws up!",

Since I was looking for something that would fit in a specific space, I did note the size mentioned in the description prior to purchasing. I used the given measurement to compare to the space I was going to put them in and ultimately determined that they would fit. And they would have, if the given measurement was true. These are slightly (just shy of 2 inches) larger than mentioned. Normally this wouldn't be any issue and I would have kept them, however I had no other use for them outside of my one plan. So, despite everything else they had going for them (and the fact that I am a die-hard Star Wars addict, I returned them. If you are even remotely considering purchasing these plushies, please do not hesitate. They are all cute, high quality, soft, fairly priced and would make excellent gifts or stocking stuffers.

I was fascinated by it and checked out Amazon and lo and behold, there's a skeleton fish! Okay, I would have preferred a more docile looking fish, as the boat captain has, but I am happy with this one. It is very well constructed and you can move the jaw to lessen the 'bite'. It is sturdy and of good size. Definitely quality construction. But I will still be on the lookout for the non-biting one.",

It's not large enough to hop curbs and doesn't have tires that are well suited for grass and dirt.  But it raced up and down the sidewalk and street and is immediately responsive to remote commands.  Can't vouch for the distance the remote works.  But we let it race for a good half a block with no response issues.  To race it farther would seem impracticable if we didn't want a real car to run over it.  Oh oh!  We strapped (with a rubber band( a squeaky toy on top with the tail dragging and with a lot more effort and attention span, I'm pretty sure we could get our little dogs to go after it.  1 was interested; but by the time she started to bark and lung at it, we humans had had enough or the day.  (Look, don't try that at home and then blame the manufacturer when your dog is whopped on the snout or the stuffed animal toy gets stuck in the wheels or whatever.  Nonsense.  If you were to try something like that and your dog got hurt or the toy destroyed this is where you chalk it up to good fun at a price...... although maybe the manufacturer - or anyone reading this will make one and make a ton of money as our 1 dog was clearly ready to rumble.  This is all an aside.  The purpose of this toy is drive it around, in circles, crash it without destroying it - the first couple times hahaha - at less than $25 bucks.  I pay way more for a few hours of golf).  Love it.",

There's even room in the baggie to add a piece of candy. I got these a couple of weeks before Valentine's day and now my son wants to play with all the slime. Hopefully we will still have enough for his whole class in a couple of weeks. I just wish the sayings on the cards were more appropriate for an 8 yr old boy.

Two guns, 3 projection cards and a projector are included in the box. You will need 3 AA batteries for each gun and 4 AA batteries for the projector (not included). You can compete against each other or play on the same team. You choose between 5 different weapons of different fire power. There are 2 different game modes to play.  I pointed the projector at the wall. The further back the projector was, the bigger the objects were displayed on the wall. It probably needed to be a little higher since the object was near the floor a couple of times. Objects were bright and clear.

Unfortunately, the sensitivity on the controls is way overbalanced and the drone simply continues to rise, rise, rise to the heavens, and even the slightest light touch downward on the controls causes the drone to plummet like a rock!  The propellers actually STOP rotating and the drone simply plunges downward.  Catching it with the controller and pushing it skyward results in a bouncing flight path that eventually ends badly.  I'm not an inexperienced drone flyer -- I've owned several and enjoy the fun of zipping around the yard in figure-eights and loops, but this drone does none of that.  It has been permanently retired to the island of bad toys.  I'm just glad that the experience didn't cost me more than $50!",

    "title": "Awesome rig highly recommend it",
    "text": "First impressions are very good solid build and a very capable rig out of the box. I have a course in my back yard 1st attempt made it through no problem..<br /><br />First thing you will notice about the rig is the weight it's perfect for the size. I added a little extra weight in the front to help with grip on uphill long climbing.  But no problem with any part. It definitely blows the RGT out of the water.<br /><br />This is a great sturdy well bulit 1/18 crawler details are incredible with a metal frame. Strong thick plastics used it has alloy oil filled shocks the tires are a bit hard but should soften over use. The rig's weight just feels right. Panda Hobby states the X1 has wheel weights installed stock and it seems like it wants to stick to the ground the center of gravity on the X1 is pretty low allowing lots of tilt. The servo is mounted on the axel but has enough clearance for as much flex as the suspension can allow very nice touch. I really like the fact that out of the box I can start to modify it with tools supplied. The shock towers have 6 available mounting locations it's set to middle height out of the box. The body posts are adjustable as well but in case you want to raise the body for any reason. The X supports molded into the part body posts make them solid. Body clips are bent in 2 spots making them a breeze install and remove, one cool thing is posts tops can be removed with 2 screws in my case I epoxied magnets instead to eliminate body clips (10 min mod). The X1 comes with 2 batterys batteries last about 15  to 20 min when the battery is dead the vehicle automatically applies the brakes it completely stopped rig going down a 45° ramp. each battery take about 35 min to recharge via USB charger. The body has a great appearance with its angry Jeep grill with working ch 3 controlled headlights and light bar also had auto brake and reverse lights that perfectly match the vehicles motion. Nice little details like the door handles, hood cowl, mirrors and wipers make just a bit cooler It comes with a spare tire to mount on as well as 2 additional sticker options for rear 3 windows and a small set of fun decals to put on the truck. From what I can tell it's ready to be modified and have accessories bolted on I can't wait to see what they come up with.<br /><br />The Tetra X1 definitely has more than enough power to climb anything in front of it. The remote has a 3 position speed control. In my opinion the low is set to low to climb even an easy hill it works great for easy flat Rocky courses. Medium is a great position for crawling it allows you to really get a feel for the power the rig does have without it being to overpowering when learning to use it, when you ease into the throttle you can hear the motor start to whine and smoothly move the truck but has enough power in this range to climb a decent grade Rock Hill without being underpowered. High (adult mode) is very fun especially if you want to try a speed run pop a wheelie or speed around those pesky slow pokes in my case my kids , while in high the to achieve a crawl takes some getting used to but once mastered you can power through even the toughest courses.  but it can be touchy if you don't have a steady throttle finger so not recommend for kids haha.<br /><br />The X1 handled sand dunes no problem and absolutely loved wet sand. With ease it will climb a 45° ramp with plenty of power if you want to speed up it instead, If climbing going directly from the 45° ramp to flat top the truck did high center but adjusting the shock towers to raise the truck fixed this (5 min mod with tools supplied).  Raising the truck also allowed it to completely drive over my garden hose no problem where it got stuck stock. From what no notice it didn't affect the center of gravity of the rig to much as it handles hills and slants just like stock. The steering is strong enough for the truck and is very responsive so no complaints there.<br /><br />Cons. No auto drag brake makes going down hills a challenge but with good throttle/brake  control you can easily navigate any downhill course. The L-M-H on the remote is cool just wish it was a bit more powerful on low so it can be used.<br /><br />Overall it's a great rig and I really enjoy driving it.",

    "title": "Great puzzle! But tiny!",
    "text": "We were appalled at the small box for the 1000 piece puzzle. When we opened it, we couldn't believe how tiny the pieces were! I was actually dreading attempting this puzzle, sure it was going to take forever.<br /><br />It actually only took a few days. The pieces have letters stamped on the back, so we first divided the pieces up between A, B, C, and D sections. I don't think we could've done the puzzle without doing that first. Then my husband and I each took a section to work on. It came together beautifully.<br /><br />The asteroid fields were the hardest. My husband got frustrated with this puzzle, but I had no problem with it. I think he must not be as good at seeing nuances in colors and patterns. I finished his second section and completed the puzzle myself. I enjoyed it so much that I'll probably keep it to do again in a few years rather than donating it like we do with most of our puzzles.<br /><br />The pieces were strong and not thin at all. They wouldn't be easy to bend and we didn't have any problems at all with that sort of thing.<br /><br />My only problem was that the pieces didn't really \"snap together\". They were very loose. So if you bump a set you have together or need to move them, then they fall apart easily. On the upside, this meant that if you put two pieces together and they didn't want to come apart easily, then they probably weren't supposed to be together.",

You can't store it in any fashion while it has water in it without dripping water from the seam, even if you stand it level without being completely full so it doesn't leak out the spout or the plug.

They changed a bunch of rules and added some things that overall make the game more complicated, and that's all it does. It doesn't really add anything more to the game (make it any more fun), it just makes it more confusing and annoying ot have to constantly read through the directions. The board is also kind of difficult to read compared the old game.<br /><br />We weren't thrilled with this new version. We'll probably just play it as best we can the old fashioned way instead.

    "text": "For the price I can't complain much but the screws for the blade guards are to short so it makes it difficult to attach. I just kept the old screws but eventually they wear out or break and I have to improvise. Also the predrilled holes on the blade guards and legs are to small. Small holes and super tiny screws make it nearly impossible to attach. I ended up having to take my drill and predrill larger holes. But it was so cheap I stil gave 4 stars.",

What we all decided was a deal breaker was the inability to turn off the stupid tune!  No doubt, that will be my ear worm for the next few days.  Fun concept, love the idea of trading, auctioning, etc...but the music, when one considers the game takes a good bit of time to play, is horrendous!  Will not buy for that reason alone.",

    "text": "Years ago I had a revolving board that cost a lot less and was darn near perfect even though it didn't have the storage base.<br />Now for this board set. Nice graphics, nice storage drawer, nice racks...not so nice is the random height tiles.  I could understand if the tiles were hand ground and carved, but for machined pieces the quality control lacks a lot.  I know it seems trivial, but when playing, the difference in thickness is noticeable not only in the feel, but the other player can see the difference.  Paying almost $200 for this Scrabble set makes me feel I'm a bit off my rocker.  Excluding the tiles, it will be a nice set to pass down generations, hopefully they won't be bothered as much about the tiles as I am.  I make no recommendations for or against you purchasing after you've read my review.",

I read a review where a customer set this pool up on large foam puzzle blocks and that sounded perfect as I would be setting the pool up in a grass area where you never can be sure a twig or stone won't poke through the bottom.  Regardless, water was seeping out from somewhere while I was filling it.  If you step on the puzzle pieces muddy water squirts through.  No, the leak is not near the plug area, the ground stayed dry there.  Also, as the water filled, the seat totally deflated.  I could not find any air bubbles anywhere near the seat areal nor could I locate the water leak/seep in the pool in order to patch it..  It is a very slow water leak as there is still quite a bit of water in the pool.  As soon as I get the energy and time I will empty the water and air and return the pool. For me, even at a great price, it is not worth it.  What a pain.",

The side panel backing looks like the back of a picture frame so you either have to leave the holder laying open to cover them or find a creative way to decorate them. For the money spent, I didn't expect to have to spend additional money to avoid having an eye sore on my coffee table. Luckily, the supplies - glue gun, box cutter, 3 pack canvas boards, Velcro discs, and material only cost $30 at Hobby Lobby for everything - and about 45 minutes to complete. My final step will be to laminate photos of our bikes and Velcro them to the top. Overall, it is a nice quality holder and does not need “spruced up” if you don't mind leaving it open at all times. I would recommend this for anyone starting or displaying their personal jet chip collection.",

I told my grandkids that if they sell them on the street at 2 for a $ they coulld get $50 for each tube.  That's a lot better than selling lemonade and you don't have the mess.<br />They like to just play with them, so maybe I'll have to set up my own booth.  Seriously, this is a great gift for the kids.  I don't know how long they last because the kids get tired of them after a while, but it's great to have a bunch of these for them to share with their friends.",

    "text": "I played backgammon about 30 years ago and really enjoyed it.  I had a set but some of the stones were missing so I decided it was time to get a new one.  This looked reasonable and although there were some negative reviews, they didn't seem to make sense and were not serious enough to keep me from buyng it.  Returns with Amazon are pretty easy, so if it was bad, I'd just return it.<br />I can say the negative reviews were not justified in the set I received. Sure, it's not leather and it's not that large, but it's pretty much the same size as the last one I had (the inner board is 13.5\" by 15\").  It was only $40, and I couldn't justify spending a lot more to get a higher quality board.  This is very nice and just what I needed.<br />There were some negative comments about the instruction booklet saying the color's of the points was mixed up, but I seem to recall they can be any color as long as you can tell the difference.  This setup is definitely consistent with other sets and books on Backgammon, so there is really no issue with the setup.  It may not be suitable for a Backgammon Grand Master, but it works ok for average players like me.<br />The box it came in was nice, so it could be given as a present and if you are looking for a good quality Backgammon set, then definitely give this one a dance.  You will not regret it.",

When he started playing with them, they started to frustrate him because of the poor quality and the difficulty in transforming them.  The helicopter rotors broke almost immediately and the others were difficult to transform.  Also the sizes are odd, the Optimus Prime knock off was smaller than all the others, so they are not all to scale.  Despite the issues, he liked them and is still playing with one or two of the ones that survived.  Not bad for a cheap knock off product, but if you are looking for quality transformers you should get the name brand ones.",
