I'd say I've tried about four different kinds.<br /><br />These ones are perfect they have the perfect rounded edges so it doesn't ship. The one I just replaced which I can't remember the brand chipped a lot on the edges. Just little tiny chips all over it and this looks like that would solve the problem. It's also really great to have a whole around the home button that is rounded and cut out some go straight down and they don't look very nice and I don't feel like they protect as well.

Have you ever picked up one of the kids devices and gone WTH is all over it, I am not touching this, while reaching for the hand wipes!<br />Well now I feel safer. We have started using this on our phones and theirs to cut down on germy conditions.<br /><br />The device is super easy to use and straight forward. Place the item inside, close the lid and let it work. Easy Peasy. I am happy with the packaging it came in. It was very protected. The unit feels, and looks  beefy. The only part I am not quite sure about is the hinge. I don't think it'll be an issue, it's likely just me. Just feels like it has less resistance than I would expect.

Then the ah hah moment came.<br /><br />Wait for it......<br /><br />It's the design of the charging cord. On the back of the unit, it plugs straight in and make the unit sit about an extra  1 1/2 - 2 inches from the wall. Why would you not put an \"L\" type plug on the unit for a more space saving design.<br />Wait for it.....<br />The plug causes the unit to sit just far enough from the wall so you can open the lid without having to adjust where its sitting. If you changed the plug it would require you to move the unit each time you used it. I would say well thought out design.",

Its not bad and fairly easy to remove.<br /><br />I can see myself wearing this more around the house or at a desk job. I also have another that I use while hiking and my outside job. Together they will make a good set. Just as I have a few bands for work and a few for dress this will likely be my dress cover. I could see myself buying it again.",

    "text": "edit 4-13-2018<br />This case has far out done any of the lifeproof cases excluding things like dust protection etc like a fully enclosed case would do. Don't get me wrong I still love lifeproof cases. Its just I have not had any of those annoying issues where the caller can't hear you unless you open the charging door. Each year apple makes the iPhone better and more resilient. Right now this is my go to case and its the one I plan on purchasing my son for his case replacement and not my usual lifeproof.<br /><br />Great case, and exactly what I would expect from Otterbox. Often when a new iPhone comes out I would search for a life proof case. I still do and they are usually back ordered or delayed due to manufacturing etc. When that happens I always go back to my tried and true Otterbox.<br /><br />This case doesn't disappoint at all. The wife dropper her phone, not 1 hour after opening the FedEx package (iPhone package) Luckily i had already placed the Otterbox on it for her. Needless to say the iPhone survived the drop.<br /><br />The case fits very snugly and I actually have had to work at opening it rather diligently. We have had no issues operating the phone with the case on. Most of the time we run into issues opening the control center (other cases) There are no issues using it with this case.<br /><br />I waited till the last minute to get my case and elected to go to a brick and mortar store. I could have saved more than a few bucks by buying it here.",

It provides some protection from bumps etc. It seems to work exactly as described, although I have been overly cautious the past week, due to the watch glass being replaced from a fall prior to this case. This case would protect my watch if the same type of accident. occurred. So Ill give it a 4 star. Its not overly large and seems to only marginally make the watch more noticeable on my wrist. Its certainly not as noticeable as a friends everyday non Apple watch. Ill also rate it a 4 for that reason.<br /><br />Edit. Still Rocking this cover 6/2018 I don't go out of the house without it.

This lives up to what I expect from a case. I put the case through a lot of abuse, and it protects my iPhone. No matter the cost, LifeProof always protects my phone. You can buy others and spend more money buying Lifeproof later on, or just spend the money once and be done. That's our motto now. My only negative remark is when a new phone comes to the market, it has more than typical black available. I often buy black at first, then several months later, end up getting my desired color. But that's minor as I usually roll the case down to the kids when they upgrade.",

It became a permanent mount that worked very well but when it came time to remove, it's unusable for the next car.<br /><br />Very disappointed!!<br /><br />*UPDATED*<br />iOttie replied almost immediately after writing my initial review. Taking her advice I sent iOttie Customer Service an email. The email reply wasn't as quick as the response I received here on Amazon. Approximately 5 days later I followed up with a second email expressing my disappointment and had expected a quicker reply based on what I had already experienced. This got the ball rolling where IIRC I sent two more emails. The first was answering some of their questions and confirming what I had already tried. While the next was simply an email giving them my mailing address. 5 days later I had received a replacement.<br /><br />There were some product development changes from the first product received as compared to the second. The first contained separate sticky gel pads that the consumer was to place on the surfaces of the suction cup and on the dash mat. However, on the second product, both the suction cup and dash are already sticky. A much thinner sticky surface vs a separate, thicker gel pad.<br /><br />I probably would have given this product a 4 Star rating initially. If I hadn't had any problems. Hard to get too excited over a phone holder. If I were to average out my experience, I'd probably give it a 4 Star rating. But I'm going to side with customer service on this one because it is what separates this from many other companies. 5 Stars!!",

The goose neck is super stiff and tough so even if it wobbles it just goes right back into position. When its suctioned into place, the wobble is minimized greatly. The pad is actually sticky enough to stick by itself with nothing and feels like you're ripping it away. I like that because that means it's doing its job. Haven't tried on other surfaces, but this thing can almost stick to anything with a phone attached to it firmly.",

But this seller does not include the pictures looped eargel! Be warned! I even ordered an eargel from another seller and they didn't send the right one either. Make sure seller is giving you what you need!!!! Earpiece itself is a 5 star though, My favorite mode!  Battery time is insane and voice quality is just good enough :)<br /><br />I ordered this because I lost my eargel to the one I have had forever. I saw the eargel replacement kit cost just as much as ordering one of these so I figured I'd just get a new refurb since mine is beat up pretty good. These headset rock btw... The one I got works great and the battery life is right on... BUT... Product did not come with the pictured looped eargel. I have bought several of these over the years (as they really are the best) and they are suppose to come with a looped and a non looped ear gel. The non looped eargel is garbage however... and requires the usage of the plastic ear holders which hurt, they looped eargels however are perfect without any ear supports... This product review would have been a solid 5 star with rave reviews if the product had indeed came with the looped eargel as shown in the final picture of the product pictures... Due to this however I must give the product a fair 1 star as not supplying the needed eargel now means I have to spend another 12.99 to get one... So much for my plan to get a new eargel and earpiece... Should have just ordered the eargel I guess... If the seller wants to send me a looped eargel I will gladly change my review to a 5 star and even order another unit... But these are junk without the looped eargel... I feel like i am slightly over complaining over a stupid eargel, but it's literally that big of a deal with this product that I have to be this way. I included the picture from the product page showing the looped eargel... If the picture is shown with the looped eargel, I expect to get a looped eargel. If there had been no pic of it on a refurb I probably wouldn't complain.. But there is and it should be there... Sold by ViannaTech",

After combing through online forums i figured out that the new ones have all had the camera disconnected upon delivery and you have to push really hard on the lens until you hear it click into place. The individual settings that you need all the time, such as for brightness or silence can't be placed right on the homepage instead you have to dig around for them. The battery dies on my about four times a day which is ridiculous, my old phone lasted a few days at least. And, the worst part, this phone delivers without a memory card so you can't even copy & paste let alone save, forward, or actually do anything until you realize this and order a memory card and wait for that to come. Also, there is no SCREENSHOT, who would make a phone without this? Also, after combing forums i find that all of the other HTC phones do but, HTC EVO 4G is the only one that does not unless you know how to unroot your phone, whatever that means. I do a lot of research and i NEED screenshots. I had to download an app which is an actual internet browser called the screenshot browser and it crashes constantly but literally it is the only chance I have at saving anything on this stupid phone. Needless to say, i wasted my hundred bucks. Oh, and did I mention that the screen cracked the very first day from just setting it down on a table. No wonder it said &#34;no returns&#34; I should have seen the red flags waving, how others left this a positive review is beyond me, must be paid through the HTC company or something. I would pay someone to take this stupid thing off my hands. I hate it so much that I never even bothered to put my contacts into it, there is no way this will be a long term relationship between me and HTC, I will never again buy their product.",

I am a little rough with my phone, but found this case up to the challenge.  The raised bevel on the screen edge does a good job protecting the screen.  I have given my phone some gnarly drops in the last few months and my phone is still pretty and pristine.  Other than the rubber getting a bit beaten up, this case, after a year, still looks great!<br /><br />Now that the 5C is not one of the newer phones, I found I was able to get this case for a third of the retail price!",

It is nice to have a dedicated cable for charging when I am on the road (rather than taking the one from my office or car and forgetting to put them back).  The only complaint I have about these is that they are a little on the short side - A little longer, and I would be able to double it over so my phone sits flush against the battery pack.  Overall, that isn't a deal breaker, but this cable is probably best for when you can put your device away while it charges.  Also, these are super durable, unlike a certain fruit company's cables, which fall apart and cost $20 each.  These will take the abuse of travel and keep working for you.  Not only that, but you won't get annoying notification that you aren't using a licensed cable and have your phone refuse to charge (which happens with a lot of cables you but from gas stations and electronics stores).",

I got that phone replaced, but the second one had a defective flash and camera that would only work when they wanted to.  For both situations, I reimaged the phones and still had the problem.  My third phone has been with me for about 10 months now.  It works just fine!  There have been no issues with defective parts and it has been a champ with accidental drops.  The biggest isssue I currently have is that the charging cables fall apart, but the phone works just as it is supposed to.<br /><br />I can't give this phone a glowing review due to the fact that I have had 2 phones that were defective (all the phones were brand new), but the one that is still working works great!  Generally defective parts get corrected in subsequent manufacturing runs of a device, so it is unlikely that you will end up with a defective device unless you buy from a source that bought a massive number of phones from the first run or two.",

I got it before it was available from AT&T, which is fine because I use it on t-mobile.<br /><br />I have a tablet, but it seems that I never have it when I want it.  When I am out with friends and want to show them something on the internet, there is nothing worse than trying to show someone something on a tiny screen, but it isn't worth it to carry around a tablet just in case- for me anyway.  The screen on this phone is beautiful and huge.  This phone is great for showing people things on the internet or documents.  Everyone that sees it agrees that it is a great screen, the biggest concern is the size of the device in its entirety.<br /><br />This phone is comically huge.  Most people (myself included) laugh at the sight of someone holding the phone to my ear.  It looks and feels funny at first, but you get used to it and don't really think about it after a while.  People are also concerned about the portability of this phone.  I find that it fits in my work uniform pockets just fine.  I also carry a purse, so carrying it is no issue.  Men usually have larger pockets (unless they wear skinny jeans) and fitting the phone in there isn't an issue.<br /><br />The stylus is almost a novelty except that it works great!  This isn't based on the same technology that people use with their iPhone or other smart phones, so you will find that there is a great deal of accuracy!  I find that it is almost unfair to use the stylus when playing Draw Something, but I still do.<br /><br />While this phone doesn't have all the frequencies for 4G on t-mobile, it does have the download frequency.  I am not sure if it is possible for the phone to get downloads at 4G speeds without the upload frequency, but I will say that my internet is faster than EDGE (which is what the phone says I am getting).  I am able to stream videos with no problem and web pages load as quick as they ever did on my old 4G phone.  The only thing that seems to take longer is sending e-mails, which would be consistent with my frequency hypothesis.  I make no promises about performance, just telling you my experience.<br /><br />The user interface is fine- and better than the US version.  The battery lasts and lasts.  Before I put lots of apps on the phone, the phone had no problem going a day and half an a single charge with regular use and hours of streaming music.  The best battery I have seen on a phone!",

    "text": "I like it but you should be aware that it may not be strong enough to hold your phone with the case on.  I have an iPhone 7s with a leather case.  In the packaging is a magnet which they tell you that you don't have to adhere to the phone.  You can just put it between the case and the phone.  So that's what I did.  It worked well enough, but my phone kept leaning more and more one direction.  Then more and more the other direction.  It never survived too many bumps or turns before it was sideways and almost falling off.  Also, if you charge your phone while on the mount, the drag of the cable is enough to make your phone move downward.<br /><br />So, I removed my case and adhered the magnet to the back of my phone.  Left the case off.  Haven't had a problem since.  Phone stays in place, even with charge cable and rough roads.  This may not be convenient for everybody, but my case is easy to put on and take off, so I just slip it back on when I leave the car.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />I'm reducing a star.  I've stopped using this completely because it has a fundamental flaw.  The bracket that goes into the CD slot is fine.  But the round rubber covering around the magnets is what causes the phones to tilt left and right.  After taking this apart, I see there is nothing that prevents the cover from rotating... not notches, no nothing.  So the magnets hold nice and tight, but the rubber cover over the magnets looses its grip and rotates badly after a while.  I've purchased a rectangular mount now and that should work fine for me.<br /><br />I can't recommend anybody purchase this mount until they find a way to prevent the round rubber cover from moving on its own.",

    "text": "We are a 3 person household‚Ä¶2 adults that work crazy hours (plus I travel some) and 1 child with lots of activities.  On weeks when we know the week will be extra crazy with travel or schedules, we try to have a meal plan day on Sunday and make up plates for the rest of the week.  This works very well for us and, while we do eat out more than we should, this does help cut down on that a bit.<br />My husband also works in a manufacturing type environment where lunch breaks are 30 minutes.  That does not allow for time to go pick up meals and have time to eat too.  So, we typically try to account for this in meal planning and make a bit extra.  These plates provide the flexibility to put them in the freezer, fridge and microwave when we make extra portions for storage.<br />I did put these on the top rack of my dishwasher without issue.  They washed up well.<br />Also, I've used other bento boxes in the past and had difficulty opening them.  I did not experience the same issue with these plates.  I really like them.  They stack well in the fridge/freezer and make grab and go a cinch!  They are also better on the environment than other take and toss options!<br />I would recommend these to people that need a good leftover or meal planning storage option!<br />I have opted to test products as a hobby and thus, received this product at a reduced price in order to fully test the product offered.

I use this as a primary wallet/phone case for quick trips or throw it in my regular purse (that can accommodate Chap Stick, gum, etc.) as a wallet.<br />I also like that the phone case is magnetic so I can actually REMOVE my phone from the wristlet instead of trying to talk with the wallet open for everyone to see my credit cards and cash.<br />So‚Ä¶.what I don't love (but can live with), is that if you put more than 5 cards and a few dollar bills, the magnet cannot hold the case closed.  It would be MUCH better design if the closure was a snap vs. magnet.  I don't feel secure enough with the magnet to actually use this as a wristlet but more of a clutch.<br />I have opted to test products as a hobby and thus, received this product at a reduced price in order to fully test the product offered.

The charging port is a little flimsy but not too bad, the screen can be a little marbly 3D rainbow, and the buttons on the side as so sleek that I have to press a lot harder. All and all I am glad I went for the Lifeproof. I stick my 3M silicone card holder onto the back, it doesnt stick on as well as it did on the otterbox because of the difference in material, so I just took a little bit of super glue and it works perfectly!",

I lost my cover a few weeks ago and didn't want to purchase another cover for a phone I will be upgrading soon. Although it doesn't have the front screen plastic, the 2 part base is very much like all the otter boxes I have purchased. Personally, I don't like otter's built in covers , and prefer putting the acrylic screen protectors. Next time I get a new phone- I will try to find this company's phone protector first.  For the record- I purchased the 6s plus size.",

    "text": "I am not sure that I can say enough good things about this case. It is absolutely perfect in my opinion. Real leather is tough and rustic. The clasp and hardware is well done, sturdy, unlike the simulated leather case I had previously that fell apart. When you open the case, there is a perfect spot for your license or a photo and card slots. The phone holder fits the phone perfectly secure and all buttons are accessible. It is also easy to remove if you do need to, without damaging the case. You can tuck some items behind the cards as well, you could even include a thin set of checks, if you happen to still use those. My favorite part is the hidden card slots on the outside pocket. I keep my debit and credit cards tucked here for added security. There are card slots on BOTH sides of this leather pull out piece. If I could find a negative to include, I guess I would say that sometimes a scratch shows up on the leather, but that's leather and to me, this is the charm and classic rustic appeal that I go for even in my cowgirl & biker boots! One last thing, I also bought another product from this seller. I decided to swap out the item for a different one.... the seller was fa-nominal with my pain in the rear request. I was delighted. Good product, great seller. Enough said.",

Everyone in my passenger seat now thinks I'm a magician because I can literally throw my phone at my dash and have it stick in place. I have probably bragged so much, that almost all of my freinds own one now. Dont get your hopes up Amazon, I only have 2 friends) All jokes aside, this product is extremely easy to use, and has an extremely strong magnet. My phone stays on the dash, even after the biggest bumps, and has only fallen once! You can either stick the metal piece that comes with between your phone and its case, or use the glue it came with to attatch the metal piece to your case or phone directly. This design makes this product work with almost any phone you can imagine. Good job on thos mount TechMatte! Now i have bought 3 and recommended 5!!!",

I thought my phone would be in bad condition, when I picked it up, I found it was not damaged at all.  It looked as good as new and most importantly I felt like my phone was protected in the case. And great protection for the camera lenses and screen as there are raised lips. I doubted that it could provide military grade protection like the description said at first, but after experiencing this, I believe it.<br /><br />So I decided to write this comment praising the case that saved my expensive phone. Other aspects of the design are also very good, it supports wireless charging and the translucent design I also like. Again, it really is a super solid case. I would recommend it to you!",

I was surprised to find the mini USB port on the base was an empty cutout and the battery box did not have battery contacts for use with alkaline batteries. There is no internal battery, and the only power connection is located on the light itself which is inconvenient when using this at its fully extended height.",

    "text": "I was contemplating adding a second large surge protector until I discovered the RISWOJOR Multiple USB Charging Station with 10 USB ports. Every electronic device I own requires a USB connection for either direct power or recharging., but there are only so many outlets on my power strip. It was becoming a pain to keep swapping them out and I frequently have a backlog of electronics needing to be recharged at the same time. This compact multi-port USB  hub is the ideal solution for up to ten power-hungry devices.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Excellent build quality<br />- 100% copper wire<br />- 10 ports with intelligent charging that auto-detects the current requirement for each device<br />- Surge protection<br />- Short circuit prevention<br />- Overcharge protection<br />- Temperature control<br />- Large ventilation slots<br />- FCC CE and other safety certifications<br />- Compact Size 4.56 x 2.48 x 2 inch<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None so far<br /><br />Final takeaway;<br />This is a superb 10 port USB  hub with built-in surge protection, temperature control, and many safety features to protect your expensive electronics. The build quality is excellent, and I would highly recommend it.",

The center is the flex point, so it's essential to beef up the rigidity on the sides of the case. I am afraid this Kit Me out World sparkly gel case does not offer the level of protection I desire for my expensive XS max iPhone. This case is constructed with three layers that amount to nothing more than a sparkly piece of paper with a hard plastic backing and a flexible outer shell. None of the layers are aligned, and there are visible gaps, so it just looks cheap and poorly made. Perhaps I received a factory second because I have other cases by this manufacturer and the overall quality was much better.

It's easy enough to apply one.<br /><br />Unicorn Beetle SUPCASE performed extensive research into the flex points of larger-screen phones that make them vulnerable to cracking and trying to twist and bend this case it ticks all the boxes for durability. I tried it on my old iPhone 6 for the drop test on a hard tile floor. It passes both the flex and drop test with flying colors.<br /><br />I have to say it is a much more attractive style than the Unicorn Beetle SUPCASE PRO I am presently using, and after seeing this, I will be ordering one to match my phone. I very highly recommend it. üëçüèª",

    "text": "I prefer protective cases because my iPhone XS Max is an expensive investment as well as my lifeline. I've been using a SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle PRO, but it is huge, heavy and not the most attractive case I've ever owned. So after nearly a year, I've been considering a change that offers similar protection in a more reasonable size becuase my phone is almost as large as an iPad Mini in that case. So is this Poetic Revolution iPhone Xs Max Rugged Case the one?<br /><br />The case feels almost as rigid as my SUPCASE PRO, but it's a little bit thinner, which I like. The Poetic Revolution comes with a built-in screen protector and has a tripod feature in the back. So far, so good. I feel like my phone will have adequate protection in this case. About the only thing I do not like is the buttons are a bit too flush with the case and the ridges on the top, and bottom sides would be better placed in the center sides for better grip and added rigidity. I think the aesthetics are more of personal preference.<br /><br />The Poetic Revolution offers a similar level of protection as my SUPCASE, and it is certainly a contender. It's less expensive, looks better, and I would recommend it.",

    "text": "When I first saw the KIDIGI Fast Wireless Charger, I thought it was just a cool looking novelty, and I did not expect it to work with my thick protective iPhone XS Max case. It just seemed to good to be true.<br /><br />First of all, It looks phenomenal. I love the rubber tire with deep treads and the red Brembo brake detail. It even came with a braided USB cable. Every aspect of this case is genuinely well done.<br /><br />Honestly, the pictures do not even do it justice, and best of all, it works with my thick protective Otterbox case on my iPhone XS Max. That case has defeated more than half the wireless chargers I have tested.<br /><br />The fit and finish is high quality, and now everyone in my office wants one. It looks like I will be buying several more as gifts.<br /><br />This QI wireless charger is a \"must have\" for any car enthusiast and I cannot recommend it highly enough!",

This case is easily clips onto a belt loop, purse, tool belt, gym bag and can be attached through your belt. I like the click and slide closure so I can access my phone fast. This will give your phone added protection if you use a regular case. It's perfect for tradesmen who need an extra level of protection and a secure enclosure for your phone while on the job.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:95fd339a83b69625e3c3b0c38831fcb8]] My iPhone is the true test of any QI wireless charging device and has defeated 65% of the chargers I have tested and reviewed because of its thick \"Otterbox\" type case. So, how well did this Mangotek 4 in 1 Wireless Charger perform?<br /><br />PHONE CHARGER:<br /><br />Charged like a champ and had no issues with a super thick case. The positioning was a little finicky at first, but once I found the sweet spot, it worked flawlessly. iPhones do not support QC (quick charge) and are always much slower to charge when using QI wireless charging, so it charged about as fast as any of my other QI chargers. I have them everywhere, and my phone battery NEVER runs down because it is always docked in a QI charger when not in use.<br /><br />APPLE WATCH CHARGER:<br /><br />The charger is built into the unit, and it works! Rarely have I found a non-OEM watch charger that works with my Apple watch. There are no separate cords, and it can accommodate a 44mm watch with ease. The watch stand is attached with a knurled nut so you can remove it for traveling.<br /><br />LIGHTNING CONNECTION:<br />There is an adjustable lightning connection to charge additional phones, ear pods, or any device that does not support QI wireless charging. I believe it will also accommodate an iPad.<br /><br />OVERVIEW:<br />You would be hard pressed to find a more versatile and powerful charger. The Mangotek 4 in 1 Wireless Charger is a top-notch unit, and it comes with three types of adapters for several countries. The watch stand is detachable so it can be packed flat for travel. Are there cheaper QI units? Yes, but so far I haven't found one that works as well or has more built-in charging options than this one. The only other charger that worked with my phone was the Belkin, and it is at the same price point, but lacked the same amount of features. I would rate this unit 10 stars if I could. It is an excellent charger, and I highly recommend it.",

I live in a hurricane prone area, so this is more than a convenience item, it's a necessity! The charger has options, options, options. I mean that literally because it has Lightening, USB-C, and USB-A  input/output ports and it came with all three cables. One of them is braided. I've spent nearly twice as much for a 22000mAH charger/power bank that did not include any cables, so I was pleased when this arrived with everything I need.

Not the upscale appearance I had hoped for.  The fit and finish of the hardware are on point... For the 42mm watch. it is brushed steel where it attaches to the watch with a shiny steel clasp. No rough edges on the mouthing brackets and it even comes with a link tool to remove the band from the hardware. That's a nice touch for an inexpensive watch band. It is packaged nicely which makes it very giftable.",

I selected this dock to use with my older iPhone 6 and wanted a better charger for my watch and It works great for both.  I have tried so many inexpensive charging docks that fail when it comes to charging my watch and so far this has been the only one that works as advertised.<br /><br />The magnetized watch charger will accommodate a 44mm and holds my smaller 40mm watch tight. I cannot tell you how many charging docks failed when it comes to the watch option.<br /><br />The area between the lightning connection and the backrest is limited and this dock will not accommodate a very thick, protective \"Otterbox\" type case. It will work fine with a normal size case. There is an adjustment wheel in back to set the height on the lightening connection pin to the correct depth for your case.<br /><br />If you have a newer phone that supports wireless charging I think you may be happier the Belkin Qi charger.

I use it for a myriad of electronics from lighting to a portable speakers and yes, a charger for my older iPhones that do not support QI wireless charging. Right now I have a single iPhone 5 plugged in and It's charging at a sluggish pace, but that may also be due to the non OEM charging cable I am using plus it is also an older phone. After 30 minutes it is at 25%. I've shopped around for comparable charging blocks and this one appears to be a very good value. It is an inexpensive charging block and as long as it continues to work and I don't smell anything burning I am satisfied.",

    "text": "It is an attractive stand and I was so excited to receive the ASPECTEK Wireless Charger 10W Fast Wireless Charging Stand, but It did not accommodate any of my iPhones with cases  or my Apple Watch series 4 charger. I tried this with 2 phones, both with protective cases and they toppled over no matter which direction they were placed. The lip reaches as far as the phone's plug and no further. I use a heavy OtterBox type case so that may differ from your experience. I am sure it will fit a phone a very slimmer case. Now for the Apple Watch. As you can see from the pics it almost fits when the cord is outside. Once you insert the cord to plug it into the base unit the Apple Watch 4 series (40mm) charger will no longer fit. If you are going to list the Apple Watch Series 4, it had better fit! There is a USB plug inside the case so you will probably want to use a short charging cable for your earlier series watch. I do not own one so I am not sure it the same issue applies. I would imagine you could just have the watch charger popping up on top, but It will take a herculean effort and some creative use of adhesive to keep it from flopping over the back or side. The manufacturer may want to change the description to omit series 4 watches.<br />----Update---<br />I gave to to a friend to try on their iPhone that uses a slimmer case and it did charge the phone and they were able to get an Apple Watch series 3 charger to almost fit, but it kept popping out because of the cord issue. It's a weird set up and doesn't really support the watch as your would expect from the design of the case.",

I Found the smaller light did not do as well when I was taking pics a few feet away and thought the larger ring light would be a great addition.  My smaller light is very bright and concentrated to the point of hurting my eyes when working on the computer, the larger B-Land 5.7‚Äù Ring Light offers a bit more dispersion so it is a more comfortable light level for computer work. The phone bracket accommodates my iPhone XS Max with a super large case that measures 3 7/8\" wide.  I used my older iPhone 6 for the picture and that measures about 3 1/2\" with the case. I did try both phones though and it fit. The bracket needs to be attached to the ball socket on the gooseneck, but that's no biggie. Just unscrew the adjustment ring, snap it on, tighten it up and you're good to go. On the whole It's a decent little light and I may prefer it to the smaller version because it doesn't hurt my eyes when using it for a bit of extra light when I am working. Both are equally bright, but cast light differently. Like I said, it doesn't hurt my eyes. No need to snap on any external filters to achieve different color temperatures from warm orange and incandescent to bright daylight. 3 Color temperatures and 11 degrees of brightness. You'll need a surface to attach it to since it is a clamp on light. Mine is clamped on to a decorative end table by my couch. A shelf would be great too. It's highly adjustable and just about any surface with an edge will do. I appreciate the clamp vs stand/tripod type of set up because my desk/table is already cluttered with electronics and this is one less thing thing that requires surface space. It keeps my phone where I can see it and use it hands free! Yay!",

If you are shooting video or want to use it at any distance it isn't very powerful for any distances farther that 2 feet.

It is perfect for shooting portraits or selfies as long as you within a couple of feet. Didn't really do a great job at 3 feet away when shooting a pair of footwear. I can't complain for the price and may buy larger version that emits more light.  The clip is VERY strong and requires 2 hands to clamp. The switch offers many color temperature and brightness levels. I do like that!  All and all it's a decent gadget for the price.<br />--- Update---<br />I ordered a larger light ring thinking it would provide more light. It really didn't. Just dispersed it more. The LED lights are very close together in this light and provide as much light as the slightly larger one. Both are good. The main difference is how the light is dispersed.",

I don't know if there is any way to remove the selfie stick antenna from the legs, but they fold up tight enough for my hands to hold it comfortably. I like that it comes with a little carrying case.

Now, that is an awfully long time for a case to last for me in college.  My poor phone suffered quite a few falls.  This case discolored a little bit after being in the sun, but that is to be expected.  The reason I got rid of this case was because eventually, the silver piece on the back broke in half, leaving one half missing and the other half attached.  That didn't bother me all that much, it did however get snagged on my clothes. Overall, I really loved this case.  Will probably look for something similar for my iPhone 6.",

It is somewhat difficult to adjust the band how you want it without the magnet clinging to the band.  And not usually in the place wher eyou would like it to be.  Additionally, it was quite cumbersome to clip the band into the watch.  The first few times it would not lock into place.  Eventually, with the right maneuvering, we were able to snap it into place.

The only &#34;complaint&#34; I have about this product is that there was not an option to choose a finish for the band.  Example: I have the black sport watch, and the clasp or hinge that clips into the watch is silver.  It is a pretty distinct contrast, though surprisingly it does not really bother me.  It is a great band for the price.  I would suggest looking for other bands if the contrast in metal color will bother you.",
