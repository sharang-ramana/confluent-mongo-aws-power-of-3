    "text": "I have never used a one piece Bluetooth to use when conducting calls. I have always used both ears. My husband has own one of these for over a couple of years and lives it so I decided to give it a try.  Must say I LOVE it, too! The sound quality is ok. I was hoping for a crisp, clear sound from the ear piece but this one, at times, makes crackling sounds or echos. It has noise canceling but I didn't really notice it. The other con is that they only give you 3 sizes of the ear piece and maybe my ears are odd but I have tried every one of them and they don't sit very well slightly in my ear. It pops out. So that affects the sound quality. I have to keep pushing the ear piece in. However... the pros are this: I love when the phone rings and the plantronics asks to either answer or reject the call. Nice feature. And it tells you how much talk time you have when you switch it on. Other than that, this review sums it up.",

The strap isn't long enough so if your a guy looking into this and you have thick wrists, this won't work. I am a female and I was lucky to get it to buckle it into the first hole. It's a bit tight and I am hoping it will stretch out. The other downfall is that you actually have to place the charger between the watch and the band or else it won't make contact to charge. Minor set back but easily to overcome. I do like this style. I just wish the band was longer.",

I love it! The charge lasts forever and I can charge my phone at least 3 times without having to charge it back up. It's heavier than what I'd like but honestly that doesn't bother me. I'd buy it again but I don't think I'll have to. Seems like it's going to last a long time. My only complaint is that the charging cords are a little short so that I have to hold the phone and the charger at a weird angle or it seems the cord won't last long. Would be better if they were a little longer so that they could bend and give more leeway for the phone. But it comes with an iPhone and an android cord and I can plus in the usb and use a normal charging cord with it.",

For subsequent changes, the charger kept \"pausing the charge\", as it says on the bottom of the screen. Finding the \"sweet spot\" of the charger in order to keep the charge going, took several [frustrating] tries moving my devices around on the ledge or lip of the charger.  Then the charge became extremely slow, up to almost 4 hrs for a full charge.  Finally, it seemed as if it stopped acknowledging my phone.

The phone cradle is 9cm wide and should fit most/every phone. I use the charger for my pixel 3 xl and it still has plenty of room. The charger is completely plastic, but has a sturdy feel to it. There is hardly any flex to the charger. This is also because nothing on the charger is adjustable. It is plenty stable and visible when placed on a desk where one's monitor would be. The charger also causes my pixel 3xl to say \"charging rapidly\", but it is still fairly slow, and takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to fully charge (the norm for faster wireless chargers that aren't the $80 Google dock, imo). The charger does cause your phone to warm up, but that has been my experience with most wireless charging devices. It is nothing extreme. Similar to leaving your phone in the sun on an 80 degree day.

One problem I had seen with the previous products (when the line was called Wilson) was the cradle getting unacceptably hot. This seems to have been solved with the weBoost line. They've also made the cradle a bit more substantial with holding arms that are easier to adjust when swapping phones. It seems a little pricey for what it is.

I am still getting acquainted, but the touch screen is wonderful -- it is sensitive, so you have to learn your touch.  I can now make fast movements without hitting the wrong buttons accidentally.  It didn't take me long to learn basic texting, dialing, receiving calls, retrieving messages, straight-ahead photography (nothing fancy).  I am enjoying my phone after just a month, without even teaching myself all it has  to offer.<br /><br />A great bonus is the LG840G is wired for WiFi use!  You will not be charged precious minutes for talk time.  I have to check this out, but a friend told me to be careful, that instead, you may be charged data/data storage fees.  If I find this is so, I will come back and amend this review.<br /><br />Anther bonus, I think, is that when I finally expand my life to really need smartphone bells and whistles, I believe this phone will have stepped me up nicely into that arena.  As it is, this phone has more than enough to fill my current music-listening, audio- and video-recording, scheduling, note-taking, social networking, web-based needs.  This is a only 2.0 MP camera, but I was recently complimented on a photo I took (and texted on the spot!).<br /><br />It's a great design -- looks like smartphones in my circle of friends, so there was a LOT more respect toward me and my phone than previously.  In fact, 3 people on separate occasions thought I had finally gotten a smartphone, and only me and Tracfone know for sure...<br /><br />I've only had it a month and I'm a slow learner, so I'm sure there is much more to get to know, but I am loving this phone as is.",

    "text": "I love my new power bank! Oh I do! It's sleek, smooth, naturally portable, durable, reliable and I am enjoying a freedom from hunting for outlets at the airport, at a large conference gathering, or needing to adapt to less-than-comfortable wall outlets in a hotel room simply because my 10' charging cable is still too short to reach my laptop. While at the home front, I can go camping or hiking knowing I will not run out of power for six months between charges!! That's incredible!! I've seen the comments on how long it takes to charge the power bank and I admit, I did hesitate to buy it, but I'm so glad I went through with it! When I received my new Anker power core, the instructions clearly stated to use attach both charging cables that came with the Anker power core, into a multi-connection wall charger. The power bank came with almost a 50% charge capacity and that was pretty pleasing to me already. I decided to see how long it took to reach each cell level (there are 4 indicator lights that blink until that cell \"fills up\" before moving on to the next flashing indicator light.) To move from 25% to 50% took 20 minutes. To move from 50% to 75% took 3hrs, and to move from 75% to 100% took 3.5hrs, totaling 6hrs 50min. In other words, or charged up overnight and this charge will last 6 months. Would you wait 8 hours to charge your Anker power core on two charging cables twice a year? 😏 Right! I would too! I also love the light carrying pouch that comes with the power bank. It's smooth curves make it easy to carry and won't harm your bag or even your hands with sharp boxy edges. It's a great joy to me to have this kind of charging freedom. I can even charge my phone and laptop at the same time! Or charge my tablet and laptop. If I was to play devil's advocate, I would first have to see how the power bank performs with different cables, if it can charge my laptop faster, for instance. If this product gets upgraded to include a fast charging port or even 3 ports I'll be buying that one as well. This is a great product.",

I do enjoy the replacement bits that come with the stylus but I also don't see (at least not yet) where I can buy just the replacement bits exclusively. On two stylus I had to replace the mesk tip very quickly because it developed a hole and functionality was compromised. Not knowing where to buy just the replacement tips would be a shame and a waste of a purchase. Lastly, the cushion grip isn't snug and it actually becomes bothersome fairly quickly.

The pen is sturdy and has good weight to it. Quality material. There is a magnetic piece that attaches it to the charger, which is convenient and easy charging<br /><br />cons: (now keep in mind i may have had these issues because it is not compatible with my device). The pen would suddenly stop responding with my ipad and again, I'm sure it's because they are not compatible. So for anyone who sees this, please only order if your device is listed in the description. But I truly gave it 3 stars because there is no real on/off button. There is a button at the top to change it from stylus to apple pen, but that doesnt work until I plug it in then it will light up (I charged it before use too). Also, you just have to let it shut off. If you press the top button it just keeps going back and forth between stylus and apple pen and does not go off.",

You reverse this process to put the case on. However, there were absolutely no directions for how to de-assemble and assemble this case so it took me about 10-15 minutes trying to figure it out. I would only recommend this phone case if this is something you plan to leave on your phone and you don't change cases often.

So I followed the instructions in the booklet and it says to submerge case under water for 30 seconds, but didn't specify a depth. So I filled a 3 inch high bow with water, placed a cup on top of the case to keep it down, and waited 30 seconds. There was no water inside the case. So I flipped the latch and unscrewed the cap on the headphone jack and had to practically pry the phone case open. You can actually pull it off by the clip but I was a little worried that I would break it that way. Once I got it off, I placed my phone on the inside of the front of the case, made sure it was secure, then placed the back on. The case was much easier going on then coming off because all I had to do was snap it back together, close the clip, and screw the cap in. I had no problems with the screen interfering with touch. There is film covering the part that scans your fingerprint, it did work, but I had to hold it kind of tight and for a second longer than usual.

Though the case can't magically compensate for inherent weaknesses in the 9650's design (relative to the 8830, it feels more apt to suffer a screen crack on impact due to the screen being glass) I feel very confident the case will protect the phone from scratches and low impact falls. Also bundled with the case is a screen protector, which is functional. I will certainly look to Otterbox first from here on out when seeking protection for my smartphones.

It's very jagged & feels like I could get a good scratch from it one day.<br /><br />I'm going to go to a craft store and see if I can get some sealant for the stone edges.<br /><br />Besides that it's not too bad & I still like it but you get what you pay for.",

The phone bounced off the trunk when I hit about 55mph, leaving a small dent, and then bounced and slid around until it ended up on the side of the road.  I retrieved it.  As far as the phone is concerned, it never happened.  The case has some minor chipping on the USB flap.  I am replacing it with another LifeProof FRE, since I don't think it is waterproof anymore.<br /><br />If you own a Galaxy S6 and don't have this case, you're making a huge mistake!<br /><br />I have owned this case for about 6 months now.  I am VERY hard on my phones (I went through an Otterbox in 3 weeks).  I drop them all the time.  This case has held up beautifully.  I admit that I do not remove the rubber flap for headphones very often (~once a week), so the reviews about it falling off may be from people who use them a lot.  However, so far, mine still seals securely.<br /><br />What finally convinced me to write a review?  I was at the beach yesterday, and accidentally dropped my phone in the ocean.  That's right: complete submersion in salt water.  I'm happy to report that it survived without any issue whatsoever.  As far as the phone was concerned, nothing happened.  As far as the case was concerned, I wiped it off and kept going.<br /><br />NOTE: you must open the USB flap to get good sound while making a call/listening to music.  While this can sometimes be annoying, it is the only thing that enables the case to be waterproof.  When weighed against the waterproofing feature, opening the USB flap to make a call is a minor annoyance that you quickly get used to.  Just don't drop it in water while the flap is open (dropping it on the ground works fine).",

It takes a lot longer to charge the powebank from solar but if you don't have access to electricity this is the solution.

We attached the antenna to the roof (there was an exhaust pipe just where we needed one). We ran the cable inside and hooked it to the amplifier and ran a cable around the room to place the transmitter near the center of the house.<br /><br />Prior to having this, if you wanted to talk on your cell, you had to hope the person on the other end would hold on long enough so you could get outside to talk. (Thank goodness it's Florida). Our house is new and it has some wonderful something in the roof to help dissipate the heat which totally blocks the cell signals. Add to the fact that we are in the middle of nowhere and cell towers are far apart, I wasn't actually sure this would work. But work it does and it's wonderful.<br /><br />Now our phones ring inside, reception has gone from \"no service\" to full service and most importantly all calls are crisp, clear and easily understood (and we can talk inside).<br /><br />It went up in a very short time, although we did take the instructions out and look them over so we knew what we were up against. It was very straightforward and getting onto the roof was the hardest part of the actual install. It went together easily and was up and running as soon as the connections were made. I did have to go out and purchase some cable holders because we went up and over door ways. I put a few of those plastic clips that stick to the wall in strategic places and we're good to go.<br /><br />Our house is 3500 square feet and it's very long and narrow so I was a little uncertain if it would reach the outside edges but I was willing to settle for service in the main part of the house. No need to avoid \"dead zones\", we've walked the house from inch to inch and service never blinked. YAY!<br /><br />If you aren't sure if it will work for you, take my word for it that I am not a techie in any way, shape or form. Instructions were clear, well written and easily understood. I did not need to call support for help in any way (I didn't think they'd come and climb on the roof)  but once the two decisions were made: 1) where is the nearest cell tower; and 2) how do we run it for least problems with cables, the rest was just connecting cables. It did look a bit intimidating when it arrived but it was very straightforward and easy to install.<br /><br />I'm going off now to make some cell calls, from my chair inside my house!",

    "title": "My Husband Likes It, But It Can Get In The Way At His Subcontracting Work",
    "text": "Recently, my husband has had the opportunity to get a new phone from Zeeker.  It is designed for contracting work so it is a bit thicker and larger than his other phone.  Since his pockets on some of his pants are a bit frustrating to fit a phone in, he wanted an alternative.<br /><br />HOW THIS WORKS<br />This slides onto the belt sideways or upright.  The flap shuts and opens easily when you pull on it.<br /><br />FIT<br />This fits his Zeeker phone very well which is about twice as thick as his Moto G Power phone he was using.  It does not slide out easily so it does not get loose when he is wearing it.<br /><br />ANY ISSUES?<br />So far my husband has been a bit frustrated in certain jobs when he wears this.  It can flip open or get in his way when he has to crawl into small spaces or maneuver into tiny spots in buildings.  He is trying to figure out a method to keep using this while not getting in his way.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This holds the new Zeeker phone for contractors.  It is a nice fit.  The only challenge is to keep it on his person while my husband tries to do sub contracting jobs.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  He says that he likes this and wants to give this four stars at this point.  If he has anything to change or add, I will update the review as he continues to work with this case.",

    "text": "My daughter and I have been wanting to do work on a business we tried to start up prior to the hoopla that shut the world down.  Now that she has her own place, she wants to have some extra camera equipment to do some photos from her location so she does not have to do it from home.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box.  It has a cell phone holder and a screw on adapter for a camera.<br /><br />HOW I USED THIS<br />I got this for a regular G12 camera from Canon.  It is not overly big.  This was to be for my daughter who has a larger Fuji camera.  I screwed this onto the camera and pointed it at me while I was holding something to take a photo.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />Honestly, this is not as nice as another one I have used in the past.  I found that it was not very stable just standing up, and that it was hard to get the legs to bend where I wanted them to and stay put.  It seemed like the camera was always shifting when I didn't want it to.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />When using this for a regular small camera, this just was not as stable as I wanted it to be.  It works, but I have to fuss with it more than I should.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This tripod is a good idea, but not nearly as strong or stable as others I have used in the past.  My daughter will try to use it but not without frustration for sure. At least she has something smaller until we can get a better one for her.  It is a task to bend it all around to find the stable spot where it wont shift or move.",

    "title": "Got This For My Fish Tanks, Works For What I Wanted",
    "text": "When I saw this, I was interested in it because it has two outlets for AC power.  It has all of the cool recharging options for phones, laptops, etc, but honestly, in a power outage, the last thing I am worried about is my devices.  We have survival things to attend to.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes with all of the cords and the battery.  I highly suggest you get a case for the cords and keep it tied to the handle of this battery so it does not get lost.<br /><br />HEAVY<br />This is not SUPER heavy, but it is not lightweight either.  That means if I am going hiking, this will be significant to carry with me.  I tend to want to keep this at home.<br /><br />HOW I USE THIS<br />I use this for the AC plug.  I put in the plug of my outlet strip that my fish tanks are hooked up to.  That powers the heaters and filters and lights.  If necessary, I unplug the lights and the heaters and just let the filters run most of the time.  I have 7 tanks, so I will alternate one side of the room for an hour then the other side of the room for an hour.  (By the way, you have to remember to press the AC button to activate the AC outlets).<br /><br />HOW LONG DOES THIS WORK?<br />In a power outage we had not long ago, the power was out for several hours.  I was able to run my pumps during that time when necessary and all was well.  I have not had to use it in an extended power failure, however.<br /><br />RECHARGING<br />I don't have a solar panel at the moment, but I do have a gas generator which is one reason I got this.  If we are in an extended situation, I can recharge this and use it for the tanks while other things are using the generator.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is perfect for taking some load off when we have power outages.  With 7 aquariums this helps me to keep the filters running for various tanks alternating to keep the tanks up and running while freeing up the generator for other things in the home.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This makes me really happy to have around.  It helps a lot when we have outages and that is really worth celebrating for me.  We tend to have seasons of outages and things like this are a must.",

    "title": "Too Many Problems Make This Difficult To Use",
    "text": "I thought that it would be a great idea to get this lens.  I was not thinking it through when I ordered it.  It is more of a hassle than it is worth.<br /><br />PACKET<br />This comes in a nice hard case with a zipper. Inside are all of the pieces, easy to take with me.<br /><br />HOW THIS WORKS<br />There is a clip.  This clip screws onto the lens.  The lens has a cap on both sides of it, so you remove those.  Then once you screw in the cap you remove the cover from the top of the lens.  The idea is that you clip this onto your camera and snap pictures.  IF only it were that easy.<br /><br />PROBLEMS<br />First of all, I as not thinking when I ordered this.  Most people have cases on their cameras.  I figured that this would accommodate for that.  Well, it does not.  Any kind of case at all, even paper thin cases cause problems with this lens.  That means that you have to REMOVE the case before you take a photo every time.<br /><br />Secondly, some cameras fit this better than others.  The best fit for this was my Moto Power phone.  The samsungs gave me no end of trouble as they just would not fit well unless I took the whole thing apart.<br /><br />DOES IT WORK?<br />I tried this with the thinnest case I have and I could get the lens to work- sorta.  I took a photo for you.  One of them is without the lens, the other is with.  If you look at the one with the lens, it is still rather blurry.  I tried many photos with the case on and no matter what, I could not get it to take a clear photo.<br /><br />I am not about to remove my case just to use a stupid lens all of the time, so this is about useless for me unless I catch a really nice photo off my porch some day and I have the time to do all of the acrobatics to get this thing ready.  At that point, I will probably bring out my old G12 camera and do it that way.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you have a camera that you never use a case on or that you whip out of your case all of the time, you might find you love this.  If not, I find it too much of a hassle to try to get a photo.  I would prefer to get out my old digital camera instead that has panoramic view as an option if I really want one.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  This really is too impractical for most people who want to have a case on their phones.  I wish I had thought of that BEFORE I got it, but I didn't.  I wish there was an adapter to add to compensate for cases and get a good photo.",

    "text": "I have been trying to get some power banks to help us in times of power outages which we get now and then.  This power bank has some good features and one that is not so great.<br /><br />SIZE<br />This is a substantial sized power bank.  It is not oversized, but it is not tiny either.<br /><br />PLUGS<br />I love the 3 different plug styles on this.  This will allow for recharging of Type c mini usb and lightning items.  The plugs tuck right into the unit which I LOVE<br /><br />CHARGING IN OUTLET<br />This charges pretty well in an outlet taking several hours at least to fully charge.  When charging with electrical outlet, there is no green light, just the blue ones flashing until it is full.<br /><br />CHARGING IN SUNLIGHT<br />Forget it.  This is ridiculously horrible when it comes to solar charging.  I have had this charging for DAYS in the light and it stays at the same level of stored power.  When the sunlight is charging it, there is a green light lit.<br /><br />CAN YOU CHARGE MORE THAN ONE ITEM AT THE SAME TIME?<br />I have charged both a bluetooth speaker and a Motorola Power phone at the same time.  One is mini USB and the other is Type C.  They charged up well, although they were slower than if one item at a time was charging.<br /><br />POWER DRAW<br />When using this bank full to charge up 2 cell phones and a large speaker, there was still half a power bank full of charge left.<br /><br />FLASHLIGHT<br />Although I usually don't use things like this for light, in an emergency it is handy to have.  This is a very bright light.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I love this power bank for the attached plugs, the nice amount of power it has, and the bright light.  The solar part is a fail for me.  I would hate to depend on this in an emergency.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is fabulous without the solar panel.  I have to take a star off for the solar panel being almost silly in my experience.  It really is not worth listing in features as it does very little.",

    "text": "I have to take a lot of photos for products as well as artwork and subjects that I want to use for artwork.  Having a nice tripod which is adaptable for various situations is important.  This one fills a void I had for a flexible tripod.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />If you know camera stuff, this package won't faze you at all. If you are new to the whole world of photography, this set might seem to be a bit rough at first.  Hang in there.  Everything comes in a small thin box.  The instructions are sparse and not overly well written, but they do help.<br /><br />TRIPOD<br />The tripod has very flexible strong legs that can be bent into a number of positions.  This is set up to do photos in any direction and the ball that controls direction is able to be locked into place easily so it won't move once you get it centered.<br /><br />WHAT KIND OF CAMERAS?<br />This can be used with a traditional camera, phone camera, and a GoPro camera.  It comes with the attachment for Go Pro separately but the other unit on the tripod stays closed for regular camera, and for a phone cam, you open the support and it can be adjusted to fit your phone.<br /><br />WHAT I USE THIS FOR<br />I use this for my G12 Camera from Canon.  In some shots I even use a screw on light on the top of the camera which is about the size of a smart phone.  I take shots indoors and out of products, artwork, and subjects for art that I want to do in the future.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />I am really amazed at how well this tripod adapts to any position I put it through.  It stays put pretty well and as long as it is somewhat balanced, it will keep my camera and light (which can be top heavy) very steady and I don't have any problems with it tipping or moving.  In short this is GREAT for what I need it for.<br /><br />REMOTE?<br />I don't use this for a cell phone camera, so I can not comment on that.<br /><br />GO PRO?<br />I do not have a GoPro so I can not comment on that either.<br /><br />ACCESSORIES?<br />There is a screw in spot for adding accessories to this camera.  I am thinking perhaps a microphone, or other items you might want to have handy for whatever camera you are using.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This tripod is very portable and goes with me when I want to catch some good photos outdoors for artwork, and indoors when I want to do product photos.  It stays put even when I put my large light on the top of it and I can shoot with the camera is almost any position.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is just what I wanted.  It is great to have the options of standing on a surface or wrapping around a pole if I want.  It is a great tripod and I love it so far.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I would take a photo of this for you but my camera is not working well on my phone and well, the camera is ON the tripod so I can not take a photo of it on there for you to see.",

Sometimes bringing all of the cords is a hassle, and other times power banks seem cumbersome to lug with me.  However, this one is a bit of a different type which I like so far.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This charger is pretty small. I would say it is the size of a pack of cigarettes or so.  It has two cords on it for either Apple recharging, or C charging for phones and there is also a regular USB port on it which allows for other charging of devices.<br /><br />PLUG<br />There is a fold out plug in the back for walls which is not polarized so you can put it in the outlet either direction.<br /><br />BATTERY<br />You can press the battery button at any time to find out what kind of charge you have left.<br /><br />CHARGING TIME<br />I have had this power bank charge up totally in as little as 40 minutes.  For me, that is pretty quick.  It might go faster for others, but I was amazed how quickly it charged up to full.<br /><br />DOES IT GET HOT?<br />This does get pretty hot when charging from the wall outlet.  Be aware of that when you use it.  It won't burn you but it is a bit startling the first time you use it.<br /><br />HOW WELL DOES IT WORK?<br />I have had to use this with my phone that is no a type C charge for now due to a problem with the phone I got this for.  It has worked well using the USB port with my cord, and I got several charges from it.  My other phone is more of a rapid charge and more demanding so I can not comment on that until I get a new one powered up again.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great little power bank to travel with.  It has the capacity to charge up Apple, Type C, and regular USB devices.  I love that it has a fold out plug in it for the wall making it easy to quickly charge up when needed.  It is small and easy to transport too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS so far.  With my older phone it is working great.

As a contractor you have to be prepared for a variety of situations.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS CASE LIKE?<br />This case is a really big case.  It will fit a larger phone and fits the Moto G7 Power fine and can probably go slightly wider too.  The case has a back window in it so that the camera can take pictures- although why you would want to do that through plastic I don't understand- and the front is completely see through.<br /><br />ELASTIC<br />There is an elastic band which holds the phone up against the front window.  There is still some space however, so the plastic is not very tight against the whole surface.<br /><br />ZIPPER<br />The zipper is definitely waterproof and is a silicone track.  They say to lube it with zipper lube from time to time, but don't say what kind.<br /><br />LANYARD<br />This comes with a lanyard which allows you to keep this around your neck for easy access.  That is a really cool feature if you are camping, or doing outdoor activities.  You can have access for quick photos, and still keep it where you can see it.<br /><br />BELT LOOP<br />The belt loop on this allows for a maximum of a 1 inch belt.  It is very tight.<br /><br />DOES THIS FLOAT?<br />Yes, this does float.  If you happen to drop it in the water, it will float for a time so you can find it.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS GOOD FOR?<br />This is good for those who work outdoors, are going to have to work in the rain for a long period of time, who are working near water, who are camping , doing outdoor activities, and anyone who needs to be sure their phone is protected from water damage.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS?<br />My husband did not think this was convenient.  It is usable through the plastic, but he felt like it was awkward.  He is doing most of the work on a cottage and not in or close to the water, but he has to refill buckets of water since the water is not working in the cottage.<br /><br />So, I would say if you are not going to be in danger of water submersion this might seem cumbersome to you.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are working through water, heavy rains, around bodies of water, or are busy in outdoor activities like camping, etc, this phone case would probably be a great thing to have.  Those activities are not phone centered, so just having the phone protected is a great asset.  If you want to just have protection against water but use your phone constantly, this might seem cumbersome to you.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is a great idea.  For camping and activities outdoors where you just want your phone handy, but not used constantly, this is a FIVE STARS item.  If you are using your phone a lot and want it handy to be protected from rain, this will still work well, but you might find it a bit clumsy.  FOUR stars is for that kind of use.",

    "title": "Perfect For Contractor Husband- Fits Samsung Moto G7 Power Phone",
    "text": "My husband just had to replace his contractor phone because he accidentally left it on the open motor area of the car, and the person he was with didn't see it and when they slammed the lid down.. OUCH.  No phone.  His new phone is much bigger.  It is a Moto G7 Power.  Let's see how this worked out.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />BELT LOOP<br />This has a great strong stiff belt loop that you slip a belt through.  It is tight, but that also means that it is not going to shift all over the place as you work.<br /><br />CARD SLOT<br />There is a front card slot so if you have to bring a card or two with you, it will fit in there.<br /><br />PEN BAND<br />There is an elastic band that you can use to put a pen in.  You have to be sure it is a good fit, or it will slide out.<br /><br />COVER<br />The cover is stiff and flips down pretty tightly with magnetic closure.<br /><br />FIT<br />This has elastic on the sides so that even if the phone is a tight fit, it will ease in easier than if it was non-stretch fabric.<br /><br />WILL IT KEEP  PHONE SAFE?<br />This will keep the phone safe.  My husband is rough on things.  He has had this work out pretty well for him.  Even if he hits the flap wrong, the phone still stays put in the case.  The inside is soft so there won't be damage, but the construction of the case is tough and will withstand hard use.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For my husband who does contract work, this is a great phone case.  It lets him keep his phone close to him but also keep it safe.  He likes it a lot and is thankful for having a good case that holds his phone safe and tight.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great case and fits my husband's phone perfectly.  I am thinking of getting another for my phone in the future.",

    "title": "Perfect When An Outlet Is Not Available Or Power Outages",
    "text": "Sometimes we just can not help it. Our phones or other devices need to be run and there is either no outlet available, or perhaps it is during a power outage.  This little power bank is helpful.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This power bank comes with a charging cord to re-charge it so it is ready to go.  It also comes with the power bank.  There are bars on the outside of the bank to show when it is full and how close to empty it is getting. There is an on/off button so that the power bank does not lose power if you are not using it.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This is a great little power bank.  I was doing some work in a room without any outlets and wanted to hear some programs from my tablet and bluetooth speaker while working.  My tablet was out of juice and I quickly brought this in, plugged in my tablet and was able to run my tablet four six hours without any problem.  When done, the power bank still had two bars left.<br /><br />IS THIS EASY TO CARRY?<br />The size of this makes it easy to carry with you traveling or into places where you need to not have a heavy duty power bank.  It is nice and small.  However, the power button on the front is easy to push, so you have to be sure to keep it in a container that won't allow accidental power button pressing.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This easy to see, easy to carry power bank is just enough for days when you need a boost to your phone or tablet.  It works well and is small in foot print too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I love having this available.  We get power outages and with all of the items we have that use this type of power it is great to have these around the house for those type of situations as well as where there are no outlets available.  Two days is a conservative amount of time, I would say it would be close but not quite depending on what you are doing with the power bank.",

    "title": "Great Red Color And Solid Performance Have Been A GREAT Help To The Family",
    "text": "We have had some issues with power outages in our area this year.  That means that if you did not remember to charge your phone, and you have to go somewhere, it could be trouble.  Yeah, I know there are car chargers, but in the case of kids who do not drive, there is not that option.  Let's see how this helped out..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS POWER BANK LIKE?<br />This power bank is lighter weight than others we have, but it still packs a punch.  It is red in color, which I LOVE because if you have to carry it in a purse or carry bag, it is easy to find in a darkened bag.  It has two USB ports and a mini USB port as well as a mini USB charging port.  There is a button on the side which tells how much power is left by lighting up a digital read out for a brief moment.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />First of all, the first charge only had to be a couple of hours, which surprised me.  Clearly it was not empty when we got it. Once charged, our daughter had a sudden trip she had to take and we could not charge anything at home.  She has a small portable charging battery, but it only gives about 20 minute of talk time and it does not work that well.  I gave her this and she went off to her destination.<br /><br />Upon her return, she told that she got a full charge on her phone and this pack still had 92% left on it!  It is small enough to carry in a purse and she loves it.  I have to pry it away from her sometimes when one of us wants to use it.<br /><br />BATTERY CHARGE<br />This has a great standing time- goes down very little- and even when used for charging phones, we get quite a few out of it before we have to recharge.<br /><br />CHARGING TIME<br />We have to recharge this at least overnight and sometimes well into the next day for a full charge on the battery pack.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a great battery pack to help with traveling and power outages, this has been a great help to take with us on trips, on sudden calls to jobs, or other things during power outages or if we simply forgot to charge the phone.  We don't tend to use it for larger items like tablets, but it should work on that too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  The red color and good solid performance make this one of our favorites in our house, despite having a few others to choose from.  This one usually is the first to be chosen.",

    "text": "One of our daughters has had to stay and house sit at a variety of homes as well as catch rides to and from work since she does not have a license to drive yet.  We have run into problems with phones not being able to be charged due to the constant relocation.  We tried one power bank, but she didn't like it.  Then we found this one..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is about twice the size of a pack of cigarettes.  It is black and has a silver screen on it which will display percentage left of power so you never have to worry about not knowing when it is near empty.  There are three ports- a type C and two out USB ports.  There is also a charging port which is the small mini USB and it comes with the charging cord.<br /><br />HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO CHARGE?<br />This took about four hours or so to charge fully, but we have only had to charge it once as we only use it in emergencies for charging phones.<br /><br />WHAT DID WE USE IT FOR?<br />We took this on a hiking trip and also have given it to our daughter to take with her when she is on the road a lot with her various relocations of house sitting.  This has come in VERY handy.  It is a bit heavy but she loves it and gladly puts it in her purse so she always has a charge.<br /><br />We have also used this to charge up a personal fan which has a great air output.  It was during a power outage and with no fan it was frustrating.  I remembered we had this and charged it up and felt so wonderful to know that even without electricity we still had access to a fan!<br /><br />HOW DID IT WORK?<br />She has gotten five charges out of this power bank so far before it has to be recharged.  She usually does not do a full phone charge however, so it might be less on an empty phone.<br /><br />ANY PROBLEMS?<br />There have been no problems with this power bank, other than it being black which makes it hard to find in a purse, backpack, or other storage if it is dark.  That is a small problem, however.  It works great.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For travel, day trips, and having emergency backup for using during power outages or being in an area with no electricity, this power bank has been invaluable to us.  We love the security of being able to give it to our children when they need to be sure and have phone access at all times to catch rides or make arrangements with us.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  Love this thing and we trade off with this and another we have.  We get a lot of power failures and with all of the rechargeable fans and such we have, it is helpful in summer to be able to charge one up so we at least have something to keep cool with!",

    "text": "One of my children and I have decided to take a lot of pictures for a small business we are starting up.  That requires that we have a variety of methods to take photos with.  We have been using this tripod for some of them.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TRIPOD LIKE?<br />LEGS<br />Each leg can individually be set into different positions and heights.  Each leg has three lengths on them for different positions.<br /><br />WEIGHT HOOK<br />There is a bottom hook on the tripod.<br /><br />LEVEL AND CAMERA PLATFORM<br />There is a level on top (bubble level) so that you can make sure that the platform that the camera sits on is level.  There is a sliding piece which you put onto your camera that makes it easy to slide it onto the tripod each time you use it.<br /><br />The top platform that the camera sits on has a ball joint that you can lock into place so that the camera can be put into a wide variety of angles.  The top section screws off from the bottom legs.<br /><br />CENTER POLE<br />The center pole can also be pulled up in length leaving the legs short or longer if you want.  There is also a carry handle.<br /><br />EXTRAS<br />This comes with an extra bolt and a tool for tightening the bolts/screws in a nice little bag that you can hang on the tripod when not in use.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />We have had a great experience with this tripod.  Although it does not always stand as stable as we would like, most of the time it is pretty easy to adjust and use.  It is easy to rotate the camera and lock it into place.  The camera stays put nicely and the bottom slider stays put well too.  I know that we can put a weight on the center hook to hold the tripod into place, but we have not found the right one yet for us.<br /><br />PORTABLE?<br />This is very portable and not too difficult to carry.<br /><br />QUALITY?<br />This is a very nice quality item.  We like it a lot.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a good quality tripod with a lot of versatility, this was a good choice for us.  It is not always as stable as we would like, but we have not found a weight to use with it yet that we like, so once we do, perhaps this will be even better!<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This tripod has been great so far.  The quality is really nice and once we get a weight, if that solves the stability problem, I will update.  At this point, it is more like four and a half, but I can only do whole stars, so for now it is four.",

    "title": "FANTASTIC For Doing Photos In Wide Variety Of Places-Can Use For CAMERA!",
    "text": "We have recently started to do photos for a website so we have had a need to have a variety of tripods to help us get good shots of products and settings.  Let's see how this one measures up.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TRIPOD LIKE?<br />This tripod comes with three parts.  There is the tripod which is three legs all jointed in multiple places.  That allows you to pose and stand this in a variety of even or uneven places.  There is a cell phone holder that screws into the top.  There is also a remote to use with the cell phone so that you can snap a photo via bluetooth and don't have to press the phone to do it.<br /><br />HOW DOES THE REMOTE WORK?<br />This remote is nice. You can wear it around your neck so you don't misplace it.  You hook it up to a tablet or phone and it does snap photos very well.  I had no problem pairing it.  It will disconnect from the cord so you can keep it in your hand.  When you are done with it, you snap it back on to the neck cord.<br /><br />CELL PHONE HOLDER<br />This will hold medium to small cell phones.  If you want to use it sideways or upright, you can.  It does not fit tablets, but you can use the remote without the tripod if you want to.  You can NOT use this with a case on your cell phone- it has to be taken out of the case to fit in the holder.<br /><br />TRIPOD<br />This tripod is wonderful.  There is a little plastic piece with a screw in it. You take that out of the tripod, screw it into what you want, and then slide it into the right place and it clicks into place.  There is a button release.  The stand has silicone on it to hold the camera steady.  You have to have a quarter or other flat head screwdriver or similar implement to tighten the screw as it does not come with that tool.<br /><br />The legs of the tripod can be formed in a variety of shapes so that even if you are on uneven terrain, you can stand it up.<br /><br />LEG GRIPS<br />This has leg grips on it so that it does not slide out of place once it is set up.<br /><br />SWIVEL?<br />This swivels once the camera/phone is installed on the tripod allowing for all sorts of photos.<br /><br />IS THIS STURDY?<br />This tripod is very sturdy.  We have used it a lot for table top photos as well as outdoor set ups.  In each location it worked very well.<br /><br />CAN THIS HOLD A REGULAR CAMERA?<br />YES!  We screwed in our rather large FUJIFILM Finepix S1 camera and it worked like a dream.  The remote did not work with it, but that was not an issue.  We also tried it with my Canon G12 camera and it worked really well.<br /><br />BEST USES<br />We use this more for camera use than cell phone.  We love the way that it works with the camera.  It holds VERY steady and does not tip or move easily at all.  The way you do it is to screw the platform into the camera, and snap it onto the tripod and you are ready to go.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This tripod is WAY nicer than we expected.  We love it for camera work and it is perfect when we need to get closeups on table tops or uneven terrain outside.  This is a MUST have for us and we are very glad to have it.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE Enthusiastic stars for this tripod set.  It is fantastic.  It is so small it is easy to transport.  We really love this and use it constantly.",

    "title": "Works Great Need To Have Longer Cord For It",
    "text": "When my husband lost his car charger, I was so excited, I ran and got this and shoved it at him to test out.  He has his own business, so it is necessary for him to be able to answer the phone even if it is charging (it charges with the car not running as well as running).  Let's see how this worked out for him.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a slim line charger that is almost like a thumb drive.  It has two USB connections in it - one is 2.0 and the other is 3.0, but they are color coded so that you can easily see at a glance what you are dealing with.  The one end fits into the lighter socket, and the other two ends are on the flat side of the charger.<br /><br />HOW WAS IT TO USE?<br />We needed the 2.0 socket for the phone that my husband has, so he used that one.  The cord we got is a long braided cord.  The reason is that if his phone has to charge and he has a business call, he prefers to be able to talk on the phone and leave it charging.  This combo worked out perfectly for him.  The cord is about four feet long or so.  We even tested two devices charging and it worked well (tablet and phone).<br /><br />HOW FAST DID IT CHARGE?<br />My husband has had it on for a half hour drive on an almost dead phone.  The phone was almost fully charged in each case.  He is very happy with it.<br /><br />EASY TO FIND<br />Another thing about this charger is that it is easier to find that the black ones that can get lost in a pocket, purse, or holder.  The purple white colors stand out and it is much easier to locate.  We also have a purple cord to match and that adds to the ease of finding when it is on.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a compact charger that is colorful and easy to find, you get two options for charging two devices.  With a longer cord it worked really well for my husband so he could answer the phone if necessary while charging in the car.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  This seems to be a really good solid charger. Having two connections is great as an option.",

    "text": "When it comes to things like a stylus, honestly they all kind of area annoying.  Perhaps it is because I have been privileged to be able to use the Wacom Professional pens for so long, I just am not that impressed with most styluses I have used over time..  until now..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS STYLUS LIKE?<br />This stylus is a very sleek smooth metal stylus.  It has an on button on the side, a plug in micro USB recharging port on the end, and a teeny tiny light that tells you if it is charging or if it is on.  There is a cord that comes with it (pretty short so be sure you have a place to sit it while charging), a carrying case out of thin fake leather, and it all comes in a nice little presentation box- perfect for gift giving.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS WORK?<br />This took only a couple of hours to fully charge when I got it.  The .light was red until it was charged.  The tip is plastic.  On the tip you can turn it either way to increase or decrease sensitivity.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />I use the original sketchbook Pro which I purchased before Sketchbook made their software freeware.  When I used this stylus with that software- OMG the control it has!  I could do very tiny work, very detailed work, and had control and precise performance I have not seen with an Android compatible stylus yet!  I really love it.<br /><br />ANY COMPLAINTS?<br />There is one (always one, isn't there) complaint I have.  The pen itself is very slippery.  That is easily solved, however, by putting a pencil holder on it - you know one of those silicone grips?  The other thing is that the indicator light is so minuscule that you have to really look for it to see if it is on or not.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are looking for precise stylus control that works well with Android art apps, this might be a great one to try.  Adjustable sensitivity, it has given me some really great control in my artwork.  It is my favorite stylus to date.  It did not scratch my screen at all either.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE stars.

I am not sure if it was the app programming or the tablet itself that made the difference.<br /><br />ACER 2 in 1 Model N16P2 (Aspire R15)<br />When it came to using this with sketchbook which is now a free app for Windows, it was AWFUL.

    "text": "(WARNING- This is an in depth review designed to help anyone interested in making a sincere buying decision.  If you prefer a short summary, see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE near the end of the review.)<br /><br />When it comes to phones, well, electronic devices in general, if it is going to break or malfunction, my husband will bring it out of them.  He is a contractor and runs his own business, so having a phone that works and is tough without interruption of malfunction or frustration is a MUST.  I waited an extra long time after getting this phone to have him use it just to see how it would stand up.  Let's see how this phone worked out for him.<br /><br />WHAT PHONE WAS HE USED TO USING?<br />The phone that he used previously was a Motorola Moto G3 with Android updated to the most current level equal to this phone at the time that he started using this phone instead.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS PHONE LIKE?<br />First thing I had a hard time convincing him of was that he could not get a case for this phone.  It is built so that it does not need a case, the phone itself is sealed and put into a strong case with strong screen.  I am going to break down the features into different sections labeled so you can find out what you want to know more easily:<br /><br />INSTRUCTION BOOK<br />Very well laid out, this instruction book makes the phone very easy to learn even for someone who has no experience with cell phones before.  It also has a good layout so that someone who is familiar with cell phones can find what they need to know quickly and easily.<br /><br />BACK CASE<br />This is a strong back case on this phone.  It is meant for heavy duty use and claims to be water resistant/proof.  I never say anything is truly water resistant, but that is what is on the literature.<br /><br />FRONT GLASS<br />Not at all fragile looking, this works well and is very sensitive- he had to turn down the sensitivity a bit.<br /><br />VOLUME UP/DOWN<br />The right side of the phone as you look at it has the volume up button on top and a SEPARATE BUTTON for volume down.  This makes it easy in one respect because you are not mistakenly pushing it the wrong way.  On the other hand, there are two buttons on each side which in a hurry is easy to mistake which side you are supposed to use and results in turning the phone into a sleeping/soft off position.<br /><br />POWER and PROGRAMMABLE<br />The two buttons on the opposite (left) side as you look at the front of the phone are the on and off button and the programmable button.<br /><br />PROGRAMMABLE BUTTON<br />This is a really cool feature.  You can set the programmable button to manage incoming calls, do a Google search, or use the flashlight.  You can also use the PTT (push to talk) service with this button if you so choose.<br /><br />SIM CARD<br />There is capacity for two sim cards- a regular and nano sim.  They will both work, but only one will support 3g/4g service.  The other will support 3G only.  There is a waterproof \"cap\" that presses into place over this area to protect it from water damage if it is in properly.<br /><br />MICRO SD CARD<br />This card goes into a slot and locks in with a waterproof door covering it if you are sure it is in tightly.  You can use up to 128MB size Micro SD card.<br /><br />FUNCTION BUTTONS<br />This is one of his favorite features- they are actual BUTTONS.  No more pressing the screen for his functions.  They are solid well built buttons that are easy to press and use.<br /><br />TRANSFER OF INFORMATION FROM OLD TO NEW PHONE<br />This was such an easy task it was almost unbelievable.  Information transferred quickly and perfectly.  We were impressed at how well the set up of the phone went.<br /><br />CALLS<br />Calls are easy to do.  The call quality is excellent and the performance is as good (or better) at times as the Moto G3 which was a solid performing phone that gave the best performance of any phone we have ever used, including the \"high end\" phones.<br /><br />VOLUME<br />The volume of the phone is good.  Speaker phone is not always as loud on the other callers end, but on the end of the user, it is good.  It is still possible to hear in a rather noisy van, but challenging.  Ear phone or wireless speaker would be a better choice if you plan to use this regularly in a truck or van.<br /><br />MUSIC<br />My husband uses his phone a lot for music- either from the Micro SD card or from FM radio.  Reception is great and he is very surprised at how well this phone plays music from either radio or Micro SD.  I have to say that I thought he was using a speaker the other day.  When I saw it was just his phone, I really was impressed!<br /><br />INTERNET PERFORMANCE<br />This works a bit nicer than his previous phone when it comes to internet usage.  When having to use GPS, internet search, or find other information, this phone performs very well.<br /><br />SCREEN VIEW<br />This screen is amazing.  Crystal clear, beautiful color, and excellent definition make this phone a pleasure to use.  I take his phone now and then to make a call because it is such a pleasure to use and view the screen.<br /><br />DURABILITY<br />This is a solid phone.  Honestly, it is one of the most rugged phones I have used, including the Rugby which was the most rugged we have used previous to this.  The performance is great, the visual is wonderful, and the size is not cumbersome or too dainty either.  I would say that if dropped in water, or left out in the rain (which has happened to this phone) will not damage the phone as long as it is not a severe abusive situation.  (Like shooting it from a missle launch into the ocean, maybe?  HAHA)<br /><br />SENSITIVITY<br />This phone has a glove mode.  That means that you can set it to be more sensitive on those days you have to work with gloves on.  This feature works great although at times, he sets it  and forgets it and tends to mute everyone he is talking to until he sets it back again (by just putting the phone up to his face- it mutes people)<br /><br />BATTERY<br />With constant daily use, my husband only has to recharge this like every five or six days depending on how heavily he is using it for music and other tasks.  It charges pretty quickly too.<br /><br />ANY CAVEATS?<br />My husband has a tendency to do and undo things and have no idea how he did it.  He is all about doing the jobs and getting them done, but when it comes to phones and computers, well, he is a bit of a Magoo at times.  Other times he is a real pro.  I guess it depends on whether his mind is on a job he is doing or if he can put more brain power into thinking about his phone.  Yes, he has erased his fish pond wallpaper, muted people he is talking to, and managed to dial someone by mistake multiple times, but other than that, this phone has the best record of NOT allowing him to make mistakes of any I have seen so far.<br /><br />HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN USING THIS PHONE?<br />I think we have had this about five or six months now, so he has been putting it through a lot in that amount of time.  It is still in wonderful shape and performing beautifully at the time of this review.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Waterproof (if sealed properly) with extra features for contractors, this phone is one tough phone.  It has held up beautifully for five or six months now, has excellent visual clarity and solid performance and is PERFECT for my contractor husband who is VERY rough on phones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one.  I am very impressed at how well it has held up, but also how fool proof it has been for my husband who is notoriously rough on phones.",

    "text": "When it comes to devices to hold phones, we have a variety of needs.  This seemed like a good idea at the time.  Let's see how it worked out.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This device comes with a clear plastic cover on the bottom.  You remove the bottom and it sticks to the dashboard or desktop of your choice.  Then there is  a lever that you press which forms a suction on the bottom that is supposed to hold it in place.  The clip for the phone opens on the right side and slides out with a spring action.  It does swivel 360 degrees to change the way you see the screen.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />Wow, what an experience this was for us.  We tried this in a few cars, but none of them had a good place to put it.  Then we tried it on one that it appeared to fit on and it stuck, but then it seemed to wobble a bit, even with the suction enacted. The real frustration with this was that the phone that this particular driver in our family uses for that car is a Moto Eplus.  That means that the clip is hard to use because not only is it easy to hit the buttons by accident, but it also does not have a firm hold on the phone.  It seems to slip a bit.<br /><br />After using this for a while, we decided to remove it from the car.  It was becoming a hassle and frustration.  When removed, the dash was a bit sticky so we used some goo remover to get it off.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Designed for phones that do not have a case, this holder just didn't work out for us.  It did not fit well on the dash of two cars and the third that it did fit in did not give safe performance for driving.  The idea is that we want to drive without distraction and this was not it.  It left sticky residue when removed too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Two stars.  Perhaps the perfect car, dash, and phone would work well with it, but it just didn't work out well for anyone in our family.",

    "title": "UPDATED OCT 4, 2016- THEY FIXED IT!  See Beginning of This For Happy Update (Left Old Parts Up In Case You Were Interested)",
    "text": "OCT UPDATE<br />I am happy to say after quite a few weeks of testing that the problem with the hands free unit was addressed.  It is not perfect as of yet, but it has the capacity at the time of this update.  Google has provided some kind of voice recognition for dialing, although it has a tendency to make a lot of mistakes, it still does work.  So, when I need to call someone for an important call, most of the time the unit will work, despite a few frustrations here and there.<br /><br />As for the phone itself, let me say that friends and family have other brands of phones in this category and they are not as nice as this one is.  It picks up calls where others won't.  I don't think I have had more than a couple of dropped calls since we have owned them, and that is a record for us!  In areas where the cell coverage is not great, this phone will pick up signals before others in the same area will (that are with us at the time).  It downloads and uploads information at a fast rate and really works beautifully almost all of the time with very few errors or frustrations. Updates are current and really good as well.<br /><br />All in all, I now am RAVING about this phone.  I really am glad we chose it.  I thought it would be best to include this update at the beginning and if you want to read the rest of my previous review for more info on the experiences prior to this, you can.<br /><br />EXCELLENT PHONE!<br /><br />UPDATE IS FIRST SEE ORIGINAL REVIEW AT END<br />I first wrote this review because I was very upset that the new changes updated to my phone (which said Marshmallow and S'more at the time it was updating) left me without the ability to use my voice activated dialing and answering features on my hands free speaker for phones in my car.  Since I use that feature 90% of the time that I use my phone, to me it is a BIG deal.  That, of course, is due to the software update, not the phone itself at this point.<br /><br />The review about that is following this- my newest impressions of this phone.  I am expounding upon what I have experienced SINCE writing the review I started with and will eventually update to a more detailed and orderly review as I get to experience more and more of the phone over time.<br />----------<br />Because I am not a smart phone expert, I am not sure which of the following features are due to the &#34;marshmallow/s'more&#34; updates that were applied to the phone, or just the phone itself.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE<br />BLAZING fast speed when using data<br />Limits you can apply for data use when using the phone<br />Great response of the screen, even with a tempered glass cover on it<br />Quick response when dialing and using phone<br />LOUD speaker phone<br />Can hear very well when talking without speaker phone<br />People can hear me loudly when I use this phone<br />Screen clarity and saturation excellent<br />Microphone transcription of text messages works great<br />Wi Fi works great in any store or at home<br />Do Not Disturb feature<br /><br />WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE<br />Inability to use voice activated dialing and answering with handsfree device<br />Hard to get used to after using the Rugby flip phone<br />Hanging up from a phone call can be challenging at times<br />Putting on speaker phone is too involved to be used fast<br />Should come with a printed manual<br /><br />PHONE SERVICE I AM USING WITH THIS PHONE<br />Consumer Cellular<br /><br />Again, I will update with a very orderly and coherent review of this phone the more that I get to use it.  I just want to keep people updated for until I get a more orderly review to post with more details.<br /><br />WE HAVE TWO PHONES- HOW MY HUSBAND'S EXPERIENCE IS SO FAR<br />Both my husband and I have these phones and he is one of the worst people on phones I have ever met.  He is AWFUL.  He is technically challenged and so rough physically I was worried as to how long this would last.  So far, it has lasted a month for him.  He loves it.  It is easy for him to use which shocks me truly.  The man has already dropped it many times and has broken the case that he bought for it, but the phone is still doing great.<br /><br />More on that when I get a chance to update again and put some better order to this review.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />(FORMER REVIEW ORIGINALLY POSTED)<br />I don't normally write a poor review but right now, I think it is necessary.<br /><br />I purchased the Moto G 3rd gen phone not too long ago after reading tons of reviews and write ups and all sorts of raves about this phone.  There is one thing that I would have liked to know which is ESSENTIAL to me and if I had known this, I would not have purchased this phone.<br /><br />Yes, this phone has nice screen, nice features, and works okay.  For the price it is decent, EXCEPT THERE IS NO HANDS FREE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR DRIVING BUILT INTO THIS PHONE.<br /><br />I have had phones which are ARCHAIC compared to this phone that have had voice recognition.  That allows the phone to answer through a bluetooth device such as a speaker in the car.<br /><br />I recently just discovered that the Moto Assist has been retired from the Marshmallow update so there are not any options for this phone to be used hands free while driving, so even the option that ate up data time is now gone.<br /><br />That makes me very upset.<br /><br />I could rave on about the other features of this phone, and perhaps to some of you that would be enough.  However, in my situation, when I am driving, I like to be able to talk via bluetooth speaker phone in the car and not rake up huge data bills.<br /><br />Any other app that we have tried does not work right with this phone, either.<br /><br />I will update this review should I find an acceptable solution to this problem and if I decide to keep the phone.  For now, I could care less about all of the fancy features of the phone when I can not use it for one of the essential tasks that I use constantly when driving.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I am waiting for something to change in Marshmallow, but I will take some time and update this review with my detailed observations of this phone as I continue to use it while NOT in the car driving.  Other than the problem which is an Android problem, not Motorola (although their program that used to work no longer does for that purpose) I have found the phone to be a very decent  budget phone compared to others I have used.<br /><br />I will update soon as I can to reflect my other opinions on the phone.  I did want to warn people right away about the current situation in case they were depending on this phone to use for hands free driving to call and answer via bluetooth speakers.  If you have an older phone that will not update to Marshmallow, then you will probably be okay.  I would wait for an upgrade if your current phone works fine with your bluetooth speakers in the car at least to use it for your phone at this point.",

    "text": "I was so excited to have found a neon green case for my tablet that I couldn't wait for it to come.  Well, the package came and the case is not the same color as shown online.  The appearance of the photo is a NEON intense glowy green.  The color of the actual case is a much more subdued grass green.  It is okay, but I really wanted BRIGHT neon.<br /><br />The case itself fits perfectly.  All of the holes line up and it does stand up well when you fold the front back.  The magnet on the front of the case is not very strong, however.  It always feels like it is going to flip open.<br /><br />The elastic strap for the stylus on the outside is nice, but if you want to get a nice stylus with a brush on it , I am not sure I like how easily it can fall out or get damaged from being on the outside there.<br /><br />The lining is a soft microfiber type fabric and is a neutral gray color.  The tablet is a little challenge to get in, but not bad at all once you get the hang of it.  It is not like some of the straps that you have to force way too hard to get the tablet into place.<br /><br />All in all it is a nice case, well constructed, and fits the tablet well.  I took off a star because of the color issues and the placement of the stylus holder and the cover issues not closing as firmly as it could.  I still recommend it for the Acer A1-230.  It is a nice case.",

    "title": "Plantronics Usually Scares Me (Note: This Headset Is Not Just For Smart Phones)",
    "text": "I have had a lot of Plantronics Bluetooth Headsets.  All of them but one are dead.  They frustrated me, left me without bluetooth capabilities in important situations, and caused me pain and frustration to no end.  The only one that still works is the first one I ever saw- it is about five years old or so and only cost about $20 when I got it at the cell phone store.<br /><br />I was not very optimistic about the M165 Marque 2 Ultralight Bluetooth Headset, but decided to try it anyway.<br /><br />It is not quite a month old, but so far it is one of the nicer of the Plantronics that I have used, which is not saying much.<br /><br />PROS<br />-WILL WORK WITH REGULAR CELL PHONES- not just smart phones.<br />-On/off switch.  I love that you can turn off the ear piece without having to press the answer button<br />-Earhook- this holds the unit in place and is the ONLY reason I can even use it<br />-Voice - you can say ANSWER and it will answer, although it does not always work that easily<br /><br />CONS<br />-No carrying case- this is too fragile to stick in your pocket or purse.<br />-Silicone ear piece- none of them fit me- completely painful and blocks hearing<br /><br />Performance wise, people can hear me well and I can hear pretty well, but only because I took off the silicone cover from the ear mike and then let it sit right in my ear- it does not hurt that way.  If I did not do that, I would not be able to use it.  The ear hook is the only thing that keeps this on my ear, but it works great so far.  The ear hook is small and works with or without glasses on.  It is comfortable despite there being no silicone pads to help hold it in my ear canal.<br /><br />I have yet to find Plantronics ear silicone pieces that fit in my ear canal- it is frustrating.<br /><br />I can hear well with this set up and despite moving around a lot and trying to shake out my ear piece and it stays pretty well- unlike all of the other ear pieces.  People can hear me well and I can hear them most of the time too.<br /><br />Answering the ear piece is easy and although I have to repeat \"ANSWER\" sometimes to get it to answer with the voice activated feature it is still handy to have.<br /><br />Another thing that I have noticed is that if I leave my phone in another room, I have up to about 20 feet away (including walls in the way not clear air space) before the ear piece gets too fuzzy to hear.<br /><br />I want to point out again- this ear piece works well with NORMAL cell phones not just smart phones.  I have a Samsung Rugby II and I was worried it would not work with this ear piece as all of the write ups that I saw seemed to indicate that it was for smart phones only with no mention of regular cell phones.<br /><br />The question is- how long with this ear piece work?  I have had so much trouble with Plantronics headsets not working for very long that I am skeptical about this unit as well and will edit as I find out.  I have given this four stars because it does not fit unless I dismantle the silicone pads.",

    "title": "Not Perfect, But I Love This!",
    "text": "The Jabra Freeway is one of the most handy little gadgets that I have used when it comes to bluetooth and cell phones.  About the size of a half size of a paperback book, this speaker is really a handy little gizmo.<br /><br />The set up is really easy as the instructions are audio and integrated in the unit.  Each area of control on the unit is clearly marked and easy to access while driving.  The volume button on the unit is easy to reach and easy to use.  It is just sensitive enough so that it will work but not so easy that it is constantly being hit by mistake.<br /><br />The phone button (looks like a receiver of a regular phone) is a little hard to see if you are looking for it, as it curves around back of the unit, but it is easy enough to find that you don't really have to look for it.<br /><br />The voice commands are not always easy to use, however.  I have tested this unit with two phones- both Samsung Rugby phones.  When using the voice, you have to press the VOICE button on the unit, wait for it to tell you to \"Say a Command\" then say \"Phone commands\"  then the Rugby says, \"Say a Command\" through the Freeway speaker and you have to tell it what to do.  Sometimes I find that even though I am speaking clearly and saying exactly what needs to be said, the system gets messed up and I can not use the voice command again unless I reset the Jabra Unit, or sometimes I have to go back in and reset something on my phone.<br /><br />For instance, I told the phone (via Jabra Freeway) to dial a number that I had been using with no problem before.  Suddenly I was in some kind of research mode that I could not get out of.  I am not sure what the problem is yet- if the phone is trying to override the speaker or what, but it is frustrating.<br /><br />At that point, I have to shut the unit off and then turn it on again if I want to use voice commands on the Jabra Freeway unit.<br /><br />When leaving the vehicle, the unit connection does shut off but the speaker still is technically on.  It is best to turn it completely off at the end of the day, however, since it will stay charged longer.<br /><br />Also, when it gets really hot (like 120 degrees in a sun baked car) or really cold, I would not recommend leaving this in the car- it is easy enough to remove and replace, however, so it is just a matter of making a habit of removing it from the car in extreme heat or cold.<br /><br />Despite the frustration with having to reset on voice mode, if I just want to access the unit, I can easily press the buttons and use it that way until I turn the unit on and off again.<br /><br />Sound quality is fantastic- people remark that they can not hear the wind hardly at all when my windows are open, and I can also hear very clearly when the volume is not up too high.  In fact, sometimes I have to turn the volume down because people say I am talking too loud when I am barely speaking!  This is a huge change from all of my ear pieces!<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE<br />The voice commands are handy when they work.<br />Speaker works beautifully even with windows open<br />Controls are easy to access and clearly marked<br />Long talk time<br />Clear sound<br />Phone hooks up when entering car again<br />Will tell how much battery talk time is left when asked<br /><br />WHAT I DON'T LIKE<br />Voice does not always work well<br />Sometimes have to reset phone when commands get mixed up<br />Runs phone down faster when leaving car and coming back through a day- looking for bluetooth connection- but the unit itself holds charge really well<br /><br />Despite some limitations, I still absolutely love the Freeway and compared to the Blue Ant S4, it is much easier to use, and much more handy to have in the car.  Compared to the Blue Ant S4, I find that the sound is similar, wind block is also similar, but the controls in the Blue Ant S4 frustrate me- they are hard to use and sometimes unresponsive.  The Jabra Freeway is superior in that department.  I like using it much better.  And it definitely beats any of the Plantronics ear pieces I have tried to use in the car.  I have gone through quite a few of them from the highest end to the most basic.<br /><br />I will be using the Jabra Freeway from now on in the car as long as it performs well.",

Even the few small scratches I had before putting this on are now invisible. However, it's a bit tricky to apply. Here are my hints -- hopefully this will be helpful. 1) Clean the screen very carefully and completely before applying the protector. 2) Make sure there's no dust remaining on the screen. 3) Carefully remove the first tab from the screen protector, and get ready to position it over the screen. 4) Align it along only one edge of the screen at first. 5) Carefully smooth out the screen protector, starting from the edge and continuing over the entire screen. The idea is to avoid trapping bubbles under the screen protector, this is easier if the screen protector goes on from one edge first. 6) Peel off the top protective layer from the screen protector. It took me a few false starts before I worked out this approach; the result works very well for me.",

I was initially really impressed for the money at all that this NUU mobile phone had to offer. I was concerned that it might not work with our T-Mobile service but it has proved to work much better than the phone that she was using that was actually made for the T-Mobile network. This phone has actually proved to be a very good phone for my daughter and has so far held up quite well. The screen is beautiful, the reception is fine and the 32gb capacity with the option of and SD card has worked nicely for her needs.<br />Usually I like to pay a little more to get a quality phone but after the experience with this phone, if I need to replace my much more expensive phone, I may consider this model for myself. Personally I have no need for a dual SIM card but the fact that this phone has that option as well makes it all the more a better value. Overall I think that for the money, you can't go wrong with this phone! I hope that this was helpful.",

My daughter recently got the I-phone 11 and needed a case.  We ordered two separate cases that were the exact same price for comparison.  This case was her favorite.  The below are some of her thoughts.<br />• This case is not chunky at all, it slips easily into my jean's pockets.<br />• I have dropped my phone a couple of times and it was fine.<br />• The “bumper sides” comes up high enough and curves slightly around the screen to protect the glass.  Although it does come up slightly, it is not too wide.<br />• The texture of the case is smooth.  The grip in her opinion was a medium.  Your fingers do not slide easily when you run them across the back or sides.<br />• It is a one-piece case that is easy to get on and off.  Yet fits snuggly enough that dirt or accidental spills do not seep into the phone.  Nor does the case just fall off.<br />• She did not feel that it was waterproof.  The I-phone 11 is waterproof, so it was a small detail she did not mind that the case lacked.<br />• Everything aligned up precisely.  No struggle to access any of the buttons or to insert the charger.<br />• Although the case does come up slightly higher than the screen, she did not have any issue with the charging port being accessible or attaching the charger.<br />• The back is crystal clear, has not scratched and she likes that she can put a picture between the phone and the case for display.<br />My daughter said she loved this case so much, she could not think of any cons.  Overall, this a good quality phone case for a relatively inexpensive price.",

The included dead cat that comes with the Mic is a bit tricky to put on as it is pretty snug but it's nice to have and works well for reducing wind noise. The Mic itself does not have any settings for volume, but those can be adjusted via the camera or editing software. The included mini tripod and phone mounts are just bonuses and both are of good quality. I do wish that the Mic would have come with a hard case to make it easier to just thrown in my bag and keep it more protected, but I am sure I can find something to use.

    "text": "I ordered the 'OtterBox Symmetry Series Case for Samsung Galaxy Note10+ - Black' for review already knowing that the Symmetry series is my favorite Otterbox case ever. I have owned it for other phone models and I have never been disappointed. The Note 10+ Symmetry model is no exception. The case fits perfectly with the cut-outs spot on. The grip is just right without being too slippery or overly sticky. Buttons function as they should with just the right amount of resistance. Drop protection is fantastic, though I refuse to actually test this with my new phone but as I said, I've had the Symmetry case before on other phones and they have been excellent protection in the past and this one should be no different.  Overall, if you are looking for the perfect case no matter what phone you have, the Symmetry Otterbox model should be one to look at!!",

My wrists are small so it is very hard to find watch bands that will fit correctly. I had my doubts about this set but I was surprised to find that the metal band came with a tool that helps to remove link pins. This was so much appreciated as most replacement bands of this type do not come with this kits and suggest you buy one if you need to remove links. With this set there is no need. The tool was super easy to use and I was able to get the metal band adjusted to fit my small wrist in no time. Even the leather strap fits, though I am at the very last hole. But overall this set is very nice looking and fit well without looking awkward. Both bands are of nice quality materials and the included band pins are of good quality and are easy to install.",

In my experience the Otterbox brand has always produced fantastic cases and this one does not disappoint. It fits perfectly and provides the maximum protection and with that said, it comes at a cost. In the Defender Series that cost is the fact that this thing is bulky. For those looking for the maximum protection for your mobile device, this would be the case to get but just know that it's going to ad a lot of bulk and if you don't' mind that then you need to look no further. Personally for me the Defender is just too much bulk to be my daily case driver however it will find a place in my case rotation. Protection is phenomenal, fit is perfect, buttons function as they should  and cut-outs are precise. Just know that even though it's big and bulky, it does have grip and is seriously a beast at protecting your investment.",

First, I have never owned a LifeProof brand case myself but my daughter had one years ago and it held up for quite a long time before breaking. This new model for the iPhone 11 Pro fits like a glove and seems to have all the protection I would want, however the buttons are a bit stiff. Usually this issue resolves itself with use, but even after a couple of weeks they are still a bit stiff. The case itself is nice looking and not as bulky as I thought it might be which is a bonus. As with all phone cases I love a good balance between bulk and protection. Some are just too bulky with overkill protection but this one balances well for both. Overall I am super happy with this one and think that it's a great value in protecting the iPhone 11 Pro!",

I have been a fan of Otterbox for years and they have always performed well and I have never had any issues with fit, protection or quality.

The fact that you get two of these is even more of a bonus. He can keep one in his room and one in the gaming room where he spends most of his time anyway lol. Another great thing that I like and appreciate, is that each has 3 ports. This mean you can charge more than just one device at a time.

My DSLR camera does not have WiFi nor Bluetooth capabilities so I can not test if it would work on cameras that have those options. With that said, the remote does work great for my Android phone. There was no issues with it connecting at all and I will definitely be using it for taking pictures with my phone. The Tripod itself is very lightweight and fairly compact and will support my heavier DSLR camera, but I am not sure I would trust it for long exposures in any kind of breeze.

The cap magnetically attaches to cover the tip or to be placed at the top of the pen so that you do not lose it.  It does have a clear round disc on the tip which I find more bothersome than useful.  I have used it to screen write and note applications and it does write without skipping.  Maybe it was me, but the lines seemed to be a bit shakier looking than when using my original Surface pen.  It does slide well across the page and only requires a light touch.  This is merely a stylus without the function to use it as a mouse.

And just the fact that it is rechargeable versus requiring a battery makes it worth the price.  My wife would get so frustrated when a pen would stop working due to battery life.  It is cheaper than Microsoft branded pens.  She has been using the pen for about a week and has yet to recharge it.<br />It has a very sleek black finish, which is very smooth.  It feels very well made and durable.  It also has a clip on the top as does a regular pen, to clip it to a notebook or in a pen holder for the Surface.  The toggle button is for your right mouse click and to screen write.  My wife had no issues with getting it to work with her Surface.  She used it as her mouse to see if it would do the trick and it did.  She also used it to write in One Note, again no issues.<br />The pen comes with it's charging cord along with three replacement tips.

Now with that said and after a bit of time with this Strada version I would like to share my thoughts.<br /><br />Overall the Strada is a great case. It looks and feels premium. Good grip in hand due to being made of leather. It's got amazing drop protection as you would expect from Otterbox. Now being a wallet case I thought I might hate it, but I definitely don't hate this one. The wallet flap latches with a magnet that is fairly secure, much easier to open than an actual latch. The best part is, when you fold the wallet part behind the phone, the magnet sticks and holds it in place. This solves the top main issue with wallet cases, such that the wallet section is always in the way, and you have to use two hands to hold both halves of the case. This one allows you to use the phone one-handed just like normal with minimal bulk. The wallet cover also has a cut out on the top that allows you to still talk on the phone without having the wallet open. Cards slide in and out. It holds two cards comfortably, probably could add more if needed. The only three things I didn't like about the case, 1 the wallet flap where it magnetizes has a part that sticks out, which makes it more convenient to open, but looks funny and just sticks out. 2 when the wallet is shut, it covers the silence switch on the iPhone. This means I have to fully open it to flip it to silent, or turn sound on. 3 the volume buttons on the case are difficult to find. They aren't clearly defined like the power button, and it takes a minute to feel out which volume button you are pushing or you have to stop and actually look at the case. Outside of that, this is the best wallet case I've ever had. I would recommend to anyone wanting a wallet case (especially if you travel), quality built right to last a long time and not fall apart. Also very much worth mentioning is that the wireless charging works great, and all of  the cut-outs are on point!",

She seems I go through not only cables, but charging bricks like crazy. This Belkin kit works great and so far has outlasted most of the chargers she's gone through. Not only is THAT a bonus, but the fact that it's a fast charger with 18w is like a double bonus. Really her only complaint is that for the money, it should come with a longer charging CORD. I must agree. Overall she is very happy with this kit and personally I think it's a great quality kit, and seems to hold up to her abuse quite well haha.",

First I would like to say that out of all the mobile phone cases I have had over the years the OtterBox brand has really been my favorite. The Quality has always been exceptional and this Symmetry for the iPhone 11 is no exception.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Has a good grip while holding it.<br />Fantastic drop protection with very little bulk.<br />Slides in and out of pocket smoothly.<br />Buttons are easy to push and very clicky and there is no break in time.<br />It just looks and feels premium.<br />It's easy to take off if needed.<br />The Symmetry is probably my favorite case so far!<br />Cons:<br />The plastic on the back looks great but is quite slippery. That seems to help with scratches and pocket use but sometimes makes it tough to hold on to.<br /><br />Overall this case is a great value and investment if you want the best quality and protection for your mobile phone.",

When I first opened this Kit Me Out case I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed. This thing is so thin that honestly I don't think it's got the shock proof protection I wanted. However, with that said, the case definitely has a niche. It's thin, fits well and does provide a bit of protection plus it just looks good. For what it is and the price, I really do like the case except for the fact that even though it's got texture to it, it's very slippery. Overall, this case does have value but it's not the ultimate protection for your phone.",

    "text": "I originally ordered the 'AmazonBasics 10W Qi Certified Fast Charging Wireless Stand - White' for my wife who has been having issues charging her mobile phone via the charging cable, yet is charges fine wirelessly with my \"brand name\" wireless charger. This one works, however with the thin case that she uses, it's a bit finicky to keep the charge going. When you initially set the phone on the charger it starts to charge just fine yet after a little bit the lights start to flash and it looses connection then starts to charge just fine. This will go throughout the night and some nights it gets a full charge and other nights it doesn't. It gets very annoying. With the case off, it works just fine and there is no problem getting a full charge overnight. This seems to be the problem with both my phone, and my wife's, which are of the Android variety. However, my daughter has an iPhone and it seems to function just fine with her phone and case so she has adopted this charger and seems to enjoy it very much. Overall I see value in the Amazon Basics charger for iPhone's, but it not as reliable for the two Android phones we initially ordered it for unfortunately.",

Belkin is normally a good brand and I have purchased many different Belkin products in the past. However this particular screen protector was damaged right out of the package but because my wife's phone was without a protector I installed this one anyway. The install was fairly easy but as most designed for the new curved screens, it doesn't fit perfectly. Granted, it's better than no protection and this design really isn't much different than most protectors on the market. For the price this Belkin is a good value but I wish that it hadn't been broken right from the packaging.",

    "text": "I ordered the ‘Cell Phone Camera Lens, Oroncho Pro 0.5X Ultra Wide Angle Lens and 15X Macro Lens with LED Light and Travel Case,Clip on Phone Lens Kits Compatible with iPhone,Samsung, Pixel,Most Smart Phone' and I have to say I was surprised at how heavy and big this thing is. It's not your average “clip on” cell phone lens kit for sure. The Lens is designed much like that of a quality DSLR camera lens that screws on to the clip that attaches to your mobile device. The kit essentially is one big lens that is your wide angle, which unscrews in half revealing the macro lens. When screwed together the lens has covers for both ends and stores away nicely in a little pouch, which then can be stored in the “zip up” pouch. You also get a very small lens cleaning cloth, very short micro USB cable, macro clip-on LED light with adjustable brightness and a small clip that clips to the Zip pouch.<br /><br />After my initial inspection of the kit I had high expectations and although using  the Macro lens does get much closer and better macro images that without, the wide angle lens did not impress as much. As you can see in the attached image of my red vehicle, the lens is very soft around the edges. Image quality is great but the softness around those edges ruins it for me.<br /><br />Another disappointment was that I can't use the micro USB cable to power the macro LED light because my phone uses the USB type C plug. I love the idea of the macro LED but I don't think it would really work anyway because it does not attach to the lens, but to the side of your phone, which I don't feel that it would really project the light where you would actually need it when taking very close macro shots. I may be wrong but as I said, I can't use it anyway.<br /><br />Now with all this said, I do think that this lens kit is a great value for the money and it will actually be fun to use for certain situations. My phone actually has a pretty nice wide angle lens built right in so I probably won't use this one as much as the macro.",

First, let me say that it is a solid case and I did feel it would protect my phone fairly well. Is it an Otterbox? NO. Is it an iFace with the rubber, shock-absorbing edges? NO. However, it's still a solid case an you can tell it is like the Kate Spade ones where they are for fashion with zero protection. I would say this one provides an average amount of protection. Since screens are so easy to crack, I usually like my cases to come a little bit higher than the screen so it gives it a bit more protection if it lands flat. If coupled with a glass screen cover, you can't get better protection and I have never had a broken phone between using the two. This case doesn't give too much of an additional lip beyond the glass screen, only a slight lift. But, it's still better than a lot of cases I have seen. I would recommend it for average protection on a phone, but would definitely make sure I also had a glass screen cover for a bit of extra protection around the edges.",

    "text": "The glass on the back of my Galaxy S7 had a big crack in it.  I saw this and replaced it on my phone.  This is the first time ever replacing something on a smartphone before.  This product fitted my Galaxy S7 perfectly and came with the camera lens and sensor protectors on the back of the phone.  It already had the adhesive strips attached to the cover for easy attaching to the phone.<br /><br />I utilized the following tools to complete this replacement:<br />- Hot air gun (blow dryer will work as well) Too much heat can ruin the battery behind the cover when taking the back off<br />-Utility knife that came with the replacement cover<br /><br />I simply applied some hot air to the back of the phone for a few seconds and used the knife supplied to remove the cover.  Where there were cracks in the cover, i had to remove/scrape the cover off due to glass shards.  After the cover was removed, there was a lot of leftover glue attached to the phone still.  I used the knife supplied to scrape the glue off.  Where it was difficult to scrape the glue off, i applied a little heat.<br /><br />After the glue was removed from the phone, i peeled away all the blue strips from the new cover and applied the cover to my phone.  I did not run into any issues with positioning or applying the cover.  Once the cover was applied, i put some heat on the back of the phone and compressed the phone with my hands for about 30 seconds.<br />Note: i did this while the phone was off so the glue could harden.<br /><br />I then let the phone sit for about 20 minutes to get to room temperature before i turned it on.  I do notice a small hair line between the phone cover and the phone itself.<br /><br />Rather than spending over $1000 to get a new phone, this $30 replacement cover worked for me.  The phone does resist water, but if water brushed up against the sides of the phone or rain was dropping on the phone for awhile, I would put the phone in a bag of rice still.  Anything that is replaced other than by the manufacture can fail from things like water resistance, which is why i did not rate this product on water resistance.",

It tends to cut off if I walk into the next room but that is not usually an issue as I normally have my phone on me and the bluetooth earpiece itself is very comfortable and clear.

My second complaint is that the holder doesn't hold the phone securely when in the viewing position. It is secure when the phone is screen down in the holder.

I still wish I could charge it while in the band.<br /><br />Out of the package, the product seems rugged and less feminine than the stock band. Kinda a pain getting the watch to seat properly in the band. Thought I was gonna rip it. Other then that, the first day went great.<br /><br />Then I went to charge it. It doesn't charge when on the charger. You have to remove it from the band every time. Because the band wraps around the watch the gap it creates is larger than the prongs on the base can't make contact.<br /><br />Silicone is flexible but if I'm having to remove it daily to charge (and it's a snug fit) it will not hold up very long.<br /><br />That being said, I will continue to use in the meantime. Customer service has been great. Very responsive to my questions. I will update again if/when the band fails.",

Or a trick or 2 up my sleeve to get it to stick. Haha! That said, I was wrong up to this point it is really on there! All you do is peel the ring from the packaging and stick it to your phone case ( i cleaned my case with an alcohol wipe prior due to it being a glossy case).  After sticking the ring onto my case I put pressure and held it for 30 seconds on each end. I did this before bed. I've had no issues. I have a Samsung galaxy 9 plus with a pretty good size case and its holding up. None of the crystals have fallen out. It swivels 360 degrees smoothly. It doesn't hurt my fingers and works great as a kick stand. I love the base the ring is attached too. It's black with a slight shimmer and a bit of texture. It appears to be of good quality. I've had it about 2 weeks or so. Again, up to this moment I'm very happy with the product. I feel the  product is priced adequately and I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.<br />In my opinion, I find this Item to be what's described by the seller.<br /> I purchased this on my own. I was Not paid to give this review.  I like to leave reviews to help others.<br />Thanks for reading.",

I realized it was too short and didn't curve around the edges because they sent me one for a Galaxy 9! Bummer, I did such a good job putting it on! TV hats why I  decided what the heck let's see how well it works before I order the correct one. Besides I can practice with the removal process.<br />So far it stands up to it's name! Between my nails and my electronic stylus it's looking good. Upon installation I nicked it with my nail nothing major. It's kind of worked itself out now that it's dry.<br />That said, I'm not sure about taking a key to the screen or anything drastic like that!  Lol<br />I stated I use an electronic stylus, the protector shield hasn't changed the efficiency of my stylus at all. It has helped keep smudges and debris from my screen hence a clearer image.<br /> I recommend first reading  all the instructions, watch the suggested video and matching the shield to your phone prior to installation.<br />Don't want to be out 18$  for no need!<br />I'd recommend getting this armorsuit shield.

They're both soft and in use I couldn't tell much difference on my phone or my touch screen laptop, but their may be a difference on other devices, I suppose. The caps have threads to allow caps to be screwed onto each other, so you can configure it however you choose.<br /><br />The fine point stylus with the clear disc cover is intended for those times when you want pin point accuracy or for signing/drawing and the clear disc let's you do it without dragging a pointy object across your screen. It seems to work well.<br /><br />It is made of metal (other that the tips, of course) and has a nice solid feel to it. It also comes with a small leather pouch to keep it in.

The case is a bit rubbery feeling, but I got use to it quick. I figure lint and other stuff would stick to it because it has the rubbery sticky feel. But it hardly holds onto any lint or dust. If it does, you can brush it off with your fingers quite easily. I am very surprised  that this case, though it seems to be bulky, is not at all bulky. It keeps the phone slim, and a very comfortable grip on the phone. The Kick Stand could hold up a bit better, but it works fantastic.",

It adds little bulk but protects the screen well, with a soft micro-fiber finish inside the screen cover.  Its \"origami\" stand-up feature is like others of the type (meaning, it takes a little practice to fold it correctly) but is comfortable to hold and use.  The material is a nice vinyl with a firm plastic body into which the Kindle easily snaps.  It won't get dingy and gross over time and will be super-easy to clean.<br /><br />Importantly, if you want the stand-up feature in a case, the origami style is naturally less bulky than the kind that folds from the bottom, like the Finite Multi-Angle Flip Case I originally tried (and immediately returned after finding it didn't protect the Kindle's corners and was thick as a pillow).<br /><br />This case's magnetic auto-on/off function works fine with my 3rd-Generation (2019 release, purchased Fall 2022) Oasis.  Its charging port and power button are easily accessible.  The cover integrates a recess for the page-up/down buttons-- thoughtful.<br /><br />This case has the Oasis-style stepped shape to its back, so it's easy to hold.  I see a few reviews here complaining that the cover doesn't magnetically latch open, but I've had three origami cases for my various Kindles and have never had one that did.  They did have a magnetic latch for keeping the origami folded when using it as a stand, and this one does too.  Bottom line: this a nicely executed example of the origami-case theme.<br /><br />Maybe best of all: this case (at least mine, in black) looks REALLY nice.  It's worthy of the elegant Oasis.  It puts the \"Yum\" in premium.<br /><br />I'm very happy.  Recommended.",

Pushing them back in is left as an exercise for the user but is not difficult-- I used the flat side of a butter knife.<br /><br />The band has a nice brushed-stainless finish and feels substantial but not bulky or heavy.  I had no trouble finding a link arrangement that fit my wrist nicely.  It took me perhaps 15 minutes from unwrapping to wearing.  It looks great, and the clasp arrangement is first-rate and very easy to use.<br /><br />As to style, most link bands including the pricey Apple ones all have links that are all the same width.

    "text": "Update, six months in:<br /><br />This is a fantastic case!  When I bought it (see original review below) I was a little skeptical of the price.  But it is holding up beautifully and is, so far, the best built case I've had since my original iPhone in 2007.<br /><br />In my original review, considering the price, I said I'd prefer the Eloven case, of which I've had several.  No more!  I'd rather have this and not have it look like it was chewed-on by squirrels after a few weeks, which was a problem with the Eloven.  This looks brand-new still.<br /><br />And the slide cover for the cards makes the niftiest snick-snick sound when you open and close it.  You know how the elevator doors sounded on the original Star Trek series?  Exactly like that!<br /><br />Recommended.  Look no further.<br /><br />====<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />Until the whole world supports Apple Pay, I need to carry a minimum of 5 cards (driver's license, ATM, insurance, personal credit card, business credit card).  So a wallet-case has been part of my daily carry for years.  The Eloven cases have been great but they don't yet offer a version for my new iPhone 12 Pro, though it's been out for months now.  So I got this case, despite its price.<br /><br />It's nice.  I got the Sandstone finish, which is grippy and attractive.  The buttons are well executed and the phone is really well protected.  I see an anonymous review here that contends the phone's screen is flush with the front of the case, but that is not true: it's safely indented so you can place the phone face-down on a table without scratching the screen.  The phone's corners are well protected.  I'm able to fit five cards in it (two less than the Eloven, but sufficient).  The card cover opens with a satisfying snick-snick.  I could do without the silly molded \"bolt hardware\" on the back but otherwise I like the looks, and the matte sandstone finish is pleasing in the hand and unique to look at.<br /><br />It is a little hard to justify the price, but at the moment there's not much competition for someone who wants more than a couple cards in this kind of back-bustle format.  There are some with front flaps the cover the screen and carry the cards, but the cards scratch the screen with those.<br /><br />I'd prefer an Eloven case but, lacking such a choice, this is a good solution.",

It Just Works, everywhere.<br /><br />Two year Update:  I've been traveling internationally nonstop with this 10-port charger and a little snake-pit of cables.  I've charged up to eight devices at a time, including current hogs like my iPad and iPhone X.  Never a problem!  No buzzing audio corruption as can happen with poorly constructed chargers, either.  Its single-cord power input with an internal, worldwide-compatible power supply Just Works. It's a tidy, lightweight, reliable solution for folks with a lot of gizmos that need charging.  Recommended.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM 2015:<br /><br />Perfect for those with lots of devices needing USB power for charging or operation.  WOW: NO POWER BRICK/WALL-WART!!  ...The two-prong AC cable connects directly to this unit.  Neat and tidy!  Worldwide-voltage compatible, too, so great for travel (it's very compact).<br /><br />There's an indicator light to show that AC power is applied, and it does the job without lighting up your room.<br /><br />Note this is not a USB hub intended for data communication between devices.  It's for power, and it provides a lot of it.<br /><br />My impression is that this is a delightfully high quality device.  I'm adding Anker to my list of preferred suppliers!",

I ordered these due to the good reviews and decent price. Once I received them, I followed the instructions carefully. I cleaned the phone's screen thoroughly, dried it correctly, and made sure there was no dust or debris left on it. I carefully placed the screen protector as instructed. However, the corners will NOT stay down! This looks bad and totally defeats the purpose of having it on my phone! After having it on my phone for less than 4 days, I'm having to replace it. The little hole for the camera lens is a magnate for dust as well. I'm NOT happy with this item at all!",

The footprint is small even when fully extended, so it's ideal for placing on a countertop or desk to film. It is telescoping so can remain small and compact for up-close shots or stand at a good height for wider shots. It has a really firm grip on the phone, so there is no worries of the phone falling out of the holder.<br />With that said, it's lightweight quality might be a challenge in an outdoor setting where there is wind or uneven ground. With the phone attached, it is top heavy, but the width of the legs is enough to keep it steady on a flat surface. The legs are not independently adjustable from each other so you cannot adjust them for uneven ground, which is fine because I don't think this is meant for rugged outdoor projects anyway. The material is a hard plastic that is somewhat thin in places. This is best used indoors on flat surfaces. The adjustable head angle is very versatile and the screw nut to adjust it holds tight.<br />I'm pretty happy with this tripod and use it for filming cooking and craft lessons.",

The main reason we bought it was coz as a parent I always need things that are portable from one room to another and out of reach from my son and this is perfect for when I have to place the laptop somewhere it needs to be away from my LO's reach and get some work done.<br /><br />Get your own: https://amzn.to/2ylh62B",

The other one cuts into my ear lobe after ten minutes, more due to the heavy weight of the thing than the thin, cheap plastic bow. Overall, sound is loud enough to hear in a car with windows down, bluetooth goes in and out, but overall, stays connected most of the time and has good sound. But I couldn't wear for more than 1/2 hour at a time. The thing is really heavy for a bluetooth. Like, really heavy. It wears you out from the ear bow/holder cutting into your lobe. Wanted to like this, esp. at the price, but need something different.",

Next night when it was charged and blue, they called the NSA convinced that aliens were inside, scanning my brain. Passers by would slow and take pictures of the house with the eerie blue glow in the windows. If you search my address on google earth at night, you'll see either a red or blue haze surrounding the block I live on, depending on if my phone batt is charging or charged. When I call for an ambulance, I just have to tell them, &#34;look for the house with the red or blue glowing windows.&#34; Response: &#34;Oh..., that's YOUR house?

Also works with an AT&T sim card. So far, so good. Only complaint with the phone, and I think it's with all the Optimus One phones, is that the touch sensitivity can't be adjusted. I dropped a transmission/xfer case from a truck on my hand while working alone in a garage (never trust an imported transmission jack!) and with blood and grease all over both hands by the time I got my phone out, tapping, hitting swiping, etc. on the screen keyboard to unlock it yielded nothing. I had to go dig-out my old RAZR, put this sim in it, restart to be able to call someone for help. Don't trust this to work in an emergency or with wet fingers or shaky hands. The touch sensitivity isn't high enough and for some, it's too high.<br /><br />All in all a fantastic phone for the value and it was shipped really fast and worked perfect when it arrived (as should be expected of a new phone).",
