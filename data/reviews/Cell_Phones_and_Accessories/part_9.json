    "text": "I really liked the band, the black color, weight (3.45 oz), installation was simple and quick ( i had to remove a couple of links), so everything was fine, except i forgot to check on those tiny screws in the band adapter/connector. Those Connectors get inserted into the watch's side slots. I highly recommend to make sure those four screws are tight.<br />So in a month of wearing the band, one of the screws got loose, eventually unscrewed and i lost it, the band fell apart.<br />I emailed to their customer service, they replied immediately apologizing for this unfortunate event. They sent me a brand new band, which i really appreciate.<br />You can buy a pair of those connectors at amazon for $7 https://www.amazon.com/Newon-Stainless-Replacement-Bracelet-Connector/dp/B076S2WCP9?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ipad-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B076S2WCP9",

I have a large tablet (10&#34;), which is about the maximum size for this. But this means that it's a bit tricky to get it in and out. Be careful if you have a similar size. A few times I got the leverage off enough that it came part way apart. It was just enough that you couldn't actually use it anymore. The good news is that if you're persistent enough you'll figure out how to take it apart to fix (it was a little tricky, but not too bad). I think they either need use more solid construction so it stays together better or they need to make taking it apart more obvious.<br />On the other hand it's only $14.00, so maybe I shouldn't expect too much.",

ANYWAY, sound is great, easy to hear.. it's not the most up to date thing, it takes mini USB to charge, and then--- people start complaining that \"you sound like a robot\" within 6 mos, and it just goes downhill from there.

So I bought the Apple leather iPhone case, thinking that the low profile and slim fit would be compatible with the iloome. Well, I was wrong... it did not fit towards the bottom and the more I used the phone, the more the screen protector started coming up from the screen of the phone. Over the weekend, I ran a 5-mile road race with the phone in my pocket and even though the phone was protected from the rain, the cover peeled up and got condensation in the phone and ruined my screen.<br /><br />Overall, these screen protectors are good, but just be careful with the case that you're using with it.

The cheap plastic has a matte finish so when you're outside in the sun, you can barely see your phone. Screen quality is awful with this case. The case itself is great and just your typical Spigen Tough Armor case, so it's best to just save the $5 and get the basic Tough Armor -- not FX version.<br /><br />The flimsy plastic cover is not flushed against the screen, so when you type, the screen isn't always very responsive and you hear a clicking noise of the plastic hitting against the iPhone's screen. Again, the case itself is durable and fits the phone well, but the marketing of a &#34;front cover&#34; with flimsy, low quality plastic really cheapens the overall product.<br /><br />Suggestion is for Spigen to re-market this product with tempered glass cover instead of low quality plastic.",

The ends of the case even starts to peel and bubble up. The discoloration doesn't go away, which makes the case look dirty and worn.

I've received calls from the USA and texts for Free,  very nice!  Calling both USA and Italy seems to run on per second billing and not really that bad.  Where they stick you is on sending texts, about .50 US per text sent, more than a call!  Finding a SIM recharge retailer has been a challenge, I stumbled on one (lottery office) outside of Rome and proceeded to charge the phone.  You do really have to search for a retailer but as long as you make people call you you'll be fine.  I bought another SIM (Vodafone) at the airport and seems to be the same concept, except that recharge cards are more readily available.  I would have given this purchase 5-stars if it wasn't for the for the lack of retailers.  BTW no MMS available on either card. Voice mail retrieval is also available for free and u can setup a 3 second greeting (yes 3 seconds!).",

First of all, it covers the front camera, making selfies look ridiculous. Also, as another person mentioned, it pulls off of the sides. There is also a lanyard that attaches to the phone. This looked neat online, but is odd and impractical in person.

First time my phone did fall from my pocket and hit the ground... not hard but enough to share the protector (not my phone, thankfully). The second time, it was just in my pocket... no idea how it got \"hit\" but it was shattered enough it was hurting my finger to get near it. On the plus side, my phone is fine, so they did their job. But at 1 a month, they are gonna get pricy. I'll be trying a few other brands and see if it's just glass or this brand in specific that seems really shatter-prone. They were also a bit fiesty to put on and I've not gotten them as lined up as I'd like over the front camera... close but no cigar. The back camera protector is going strong and I've got the two extra, so half a point for that small grace. I'm not hard on my phone (no shatters or breaks, rarely even a small tumble off the bed) and I'd like my protectors to last a little longer than a month.",

Second, I wanted a case that was comfortable to hold. The back side of the case is smooth so the phone slides into a pocket. The inner shell of the case provides a thin rubbery frame around the front of the phone and makes it easy to get a good grip when texting or talking. Third, I wanted a case that would truly protect my new phone. The case looked very sleek and I wondered if it would truly protect my phone in the event of a drop. I have accidentally dropped the phone several times (on the front of my phone) on cement and the case prevented scratches or any other damage. I love the case and would recommend it to everyone.",

First, my car has no level and untextured surface in the dash area that does not block something important like the odometer. Ive tried suction cup things and because of the texture or the curves, the suction would not stay. The front window is too far from the driver seat to make mounting anything to it very useful. Second, the vents are created in a way that phone holding devices can attach to them. So I've been searching and trying for 12'ish years to find something to hold my phone, preferably in my line of site, but at this point I'll take anything because im tired of fishing it out of the area between the passenger seat and door after I've made too sharp off a turn and its slid off the seat.<br /><br />This item so far has worked out great. The adhesion to the dash is holding fast. My phone fits it snuggly. The price was good. I'm happy with it.<br /><br />My future concerns: haven't had it over the summer yet and your dash, especially a black dash, can get pretty toasty. I'm afraid the adhesion will fail. I also would like the ability to move it. I'm afraid if I peel it off the stickiness will break down. I guess time will tell. At this price point I would not mind if I have to replace it every year or so.",

There are cheaper options out there but otter box has never let me down. It adds some bulk to the phone so it's not so slippery while not adding so much that you can't fit it in your pocket or whatnot.

The side functions are easy to use. It is easy to grasp.<br />I've had other Otterbox cases over the years from different series and this one appears to protect as well as the bulkier cases. I haven't dropped it yet so can't be 💯 sure on that point.<br />By mistake with my last phone, it was left behind on a table when we went out. I came back to the phone having been mauled by my dog. He chewed the case corners really well, cracked the glass on the front and back. Thankfully he was not able to chew thru the case and actually eat/swallow any glass. I'm pretty sure the case saved the dog, even though the phone was trashed.<br />I'm an Otterbox fan for life!",

Will update review should I encounter any issues in the future.  FYI, this is my FIRST glass type screen protector, having used SEVERAL other types and brands over the years for both my iPhone and iPad.  If I like this well enough, I plan on replacing my iPad screen protector with one of these.  Big advantage of this type is extreme clarity it provides with virtually NO compromise of viewing screen.  In fact, you don't even realize there is a protector on the screen.  Easy to wipe clean, and fingers just glide over it.  NICE!!!!!

The stand charged makes it super easy to charge and it kind of even makes my phone/watch a digital clock. If my husband ever gets an Apple Watch I will for sure be buying him one of these as well.",

My husband and I each put one of the magnet under our case and it does the trick perfectly. The only complaint is that the smaller circle magnet, you kind of need to make sure you hit the magnet right on, or it will fall off. The magnet does have a sticky on it though so you could easily solve that problem if you used the sticky option. The square magnet is a lot bigger and it works great in my case, I don't really need to make sure the magnets hit right on.",

It was only after I met my wife and used her phone to locate mine that I was able to locate it on an out-of-the-way shortcut I take close to a limestone quarry.<br /><br />I use this case as a safeguard against rain and sweat while riding my bicycle. Otherwise the phone is in a minimal case that's not very protective.<br /><br />I suppose the proof of a good case is forgetting that you use it. This case is pretty good in that regard. The plastic screen feels different from glass - can't think of much beyond that to criticize.<br /><br />The case survived its only test to date, which was probably nothing more that being dropped from about 1.5m off the ground at moderate speed onto hard, uneven suface.<br /><br />The thumbprint reader works fine with this case. In my experience with this type of case, the weak points are as follows. The thumbprint reader will gradually become loose and opaque. This might be because I'm always removing the phone. The other flaw is the flimsiness of the silence button actuator. There is a little clip that holds the circular actuator against the frame of the case, and those are generally too brittle/weak for the job. This might be another result from removing the phone often. I know that the actuator sometimes becomes misaligned when I'm putting the phone into the case. IDK<br /><br />BTW I ended up with this case because the Lifeproof case I originally bought didn't fit the iPhone SE 2. It is close enough that you can fit the phone into the case and kinda make it work, but all the buttons are misaligned. With this case everything fits perfectly. And the price is less than 1/3 the price of the Lifeproof case.",

The accessoary is the attachment that allows you to place your mobile phone in the middle of the light. There was always a connection point there, but I originally did not get that attachment. I don't remember if it was in the photograph of what ships wiht the ring light when I originally bought it in July. I assume not. It is in the photo of what you get when you order this now. It works much better than the phone attachment that attaches to the stand below the light because it is flexible and easy to reposition once the phone is already attached to it.<br /><br />The wonderful thing is that without charging me anything more, the company decided this should be with the package I bought several months ago and without any request from me, they shipped it to me.<br /><br />The whole light set up works really well. My favorite things are: (1)  It has 3 settings for the light tone. (2) The tripod is super configurable so I can sit it on my desk or stand it on the floor and it works equally well both ways. (3)  The remote control works GREAT! It allows me to take a photo with my iPhone and also will start recording a video with the iPhone.",

Overall really happy with this and glad to have this around. Very convenient on especially trips but for me great to have since I tend to beat up my phone using it for music and videos which tends to drain it even with its great battery power.

Do not buy!<br /><br />I LOVE this little travel charger and it will from now go on all my travels with me. There is nothing worse than being in a new environment when you are away, mostly hotel rooms or on a cruise in your cabin, and you are not used to the layout and stumble around in the middle of the night trying to find the bathroom. Then you disturb the other person trying to sleep or worse hit your toes. With this travel charger you beat 2 birds with one stone. For one you always have a travel charger with you, but even better, it is a night light that allows you to have just a little light in the room that shows you where things are. It comes with 7 different lights so you can find the one that is the least annoying to you, I personally like the pink since it is not as bright as the white but still gives a lot of light).<br /><br />This charger is super easy to use and even better yet is a fast charger. Why anyone these days would even make a regular charger anymore is beyond me but you can still get those but thankfully this one is not one of them. IF your phone can be fast charged, this charger will recognize it and charge it appropriately. I love this one and it is absolutely perfect!",

Not all plains still have a way to help you charge your battery so having one on you will help. It is not the largest battery pack I have but you don't always need that. It has a couple of outlets which is awesome in case you do want to share with your fellow travelers.<br /><br />Some people complain about the bright light in the front. Personally that does not bother me. Actually when i travel I like that because I use it as a night light. it helps getting around in a different room like a hotel room or the cruise ship room that you are not aware of and prevents you from bumping into things. So instead of having to bring a night light you can use this, which personally I like. For those who don't like it, just cover it up, easy.<br /><br />All in all I really like this and can only recommend it.

    "text": "The Caseology Legion Violet Case for Galaxy S9 (2018) is a good product but not great.  After having it for about a year, there are a few things I like about it and others not so much.<br /><br />While the case is durable, easy to hold, and enables me to use all the ports, power button, and volume rocker easily, and it also works well with wireless charging, the case does not confidently protect a Galaxy S9.  The photos will show that the screen of the Galaxy S9 phone curves out further than the case can protect, if dropped.<br /><br />The photos also show a Zapp screen protector from before it cracked when the phone was knocked off a shelf approximately 3 feet onto vinyl flooring.  Both the case and the screen protector combined saved the phone and technically did their job.<br /><br />Notice the gap between the display and the screen protector and the case – it is not adequately protected.  That gap is sharp and a dust magnet.  Without the screen protector the case is fair, although it doesn't account for the few millimeters of the phone screen rising above the edges of the case itself.  If dropped face down, the case will not protect the phone.<br /><br />You can also see in the photos; fingerprints are very easily seen on the color portion of the case that is also not textured enough for confidence with grip while holding the phone.  The SIDES of the case have an adequate grip, however even a light texture added to the back of the case would have been an appropriate addition.<br /><br />My personal experience with this case is that while it is a good product, it is not designed to protect an S9 with the curved screen bulging past the case.  This small discrepancy leaves S9 phones with little to no protection especially if dropped on a hard surface.<br /><br />I have not been able to find an decent screen protector to work with this case.  This could be a design flaw of the phone because when researching cases and screensavers for the Galaxy S9 most everyone has the same complaint about the display of the phone curving toward the edge.<br /><br />My main concern is that this case advertises protection and after having it for nearly a year, I cannot say with 100% certainty this case would be a product I would purchase FOR protection.<br /><br />There will more than likely be a few of you out there who will point out that my phone was protected from the fall and you would be correct as I stated above.  However, a 3 foot drop onto a vinyl floor should not have caused ANY damage to any part of the device or screen protector.  That curved screen is not amply covered to be protected.<br /><br />Caseology is a good product, I have had a few cases prior that have all done the job described, however this is the only model I am not 100% confident to protect my device especially considering it states \"Reinforced Protection\".",

EVERYONE I called, when talking to them on speakerphone said the same thing:  They heard an echo on THEMSELVES only when they spoke.  When I spoke, they could hear me with no echo.  When they spoke, they heard an echo.  I heard no echo either way at my end and it didn't matter what the speakerphone volume was for this to occur.<br /><br />After over an hour with Apple Support, trying all sorts of things, the rep said, try taking off the case.

So, rather than return the case, I cut out the two spots on the bottom of the case that cover the speaker holes on the bottom of the iPhone 2020 SE, and that stopped the echo while still using this case.<br /><br />Hope this helps others with this rather unusual issue, with this specific case when used with the 2020 iPhone SE",

The face plate has a deep ridge that the rubber outter case  fits into for a super lock. The finger scanner is perfect. I did not receive this case for free to write a review. I never write reviews but I looked for hours in picking out a case and I thought I would help someone else save a bit of time. As this is a new 2021 phone I could not find many cases.  This one is a bit more but I really like it. I hope this helps you.",

I am definitely going to buy cases from this company from now on. Definitely recommend this case!<br />Pros<br />+ The pattern secretly help you grab the phone more securely<br />+ Super sturdy. Dropped 50+ times last year and screen never crack<br />+ The color is elegant<br />Cons<br />- The edge of the case does have the \"wear off\" color but given that I dropped that many times, I'm totally fine with that. I rather have a wear off case than a cracked screen!<br /><br />Lorraine from Destinated Survivor actually used the same case but for iPhone ;) (in case if you wonder)",

I realized that dust appears on the bottom of my phone, which is the first spray I sprayed on the protector, which means dust are hidden on the bottle. So make sure to spray it on somewhere else before you apply it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The idea is good<br />-It DOES come with a  CLEAR CASE<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Air bubble everywhere<br />-Dust come out from the solution<br />-Waste of money<br />-it just doesn't work<br /><br />Just buy it if you can't find a better clear case in the market.

Has a beautiful vintage but clean look to it.  At least that is the case with the whiskey/beiged colored one.  This should age really well.  Well done.",

I do like the backstand and my Qi charger is on the way so I'll update if there are any issues charging the Galaxy with this case on. Only con I can list is the flap for the charger is a bit too narrow to accommodate the USB-A to USB-C dongle which comes with the phone to do a phone to phone transfer. Had to take the case off to perform this function but not really a big deal.

This was perfect!!!  I will order another one in a different color.  Great job!!",

    "text": "Beautiful kit! Has everything you need: screen protector, clear instructions, alcohol infused cloths, dust removing tape, microfiber cloth, temporary hinge tapes and bubble diffusing cardboard piece. I didn't even need to use the cardboard piece... The hinge tapes are a truly inspired idea! They help you position the screen on your camera and keep it in the correct position until you are ready to proceed with exposing the sticky side.<br /><br />So, I positioned the screen protector with the wonderful hinge tapes. Then I flipped it back up and cleaned the phone's screen with the alcohol infused cloth, and I wore nitrile gloves because handling isopropyl alcohol with bare hands is simply not a good idea (per Hulda Regehr Clark - The Cure for All Diseases). Then, I decided it's really a good idea to just keep the gloves on for the rest of the operation, so as to avoid accidental smudges/fingerprints in the work area.<br /><br />After the alcohol cleaning, I used the dust removing tape, which worked nicely. Then, I pulled the backing off the screen protector and gently let it drop into place onto the phone. To my amazement, it just very naturally adhered to the phone, without any further input from me. I could see the contact area spreading at a good pace and leaving absolutely no air bubbles in its wake. It just kind of married up with the screen of its own accord, as if by magic. No further work needed from me. It fell perfectly in place and with no air bubbles whatsoever (have I mentioned that before...?)! Wow! How cool is that???<br /><br />The screen protector looks very nice on the phone and it cleans easily too. Lines up perfectly with all the needed connections on my J3 2016. And the whole installation procedure took under 5 minutes.",

The armband isn't elastic and when you sweat, the armband falls down your arm. The material also makes sweat causing irritation.  For the price, this is an okay armband.

I never had a problem with my other phones.  I contact the seller and they quickly shipped me a new one.  So far, I haven't had a problem with my new case.  I probably just had a defective one.<br /><br />Pros:  Very protective, sturdy, holds snugly, good price.<br />Cons:  A little difficult to remove phone from if switching to arm band.  Button covers don't always work right away.  There is a middle silicone case and a hard outside cover.  The outside cover sometimes comes apart.<br /><br />Overall, good case.  If you don't ever remove it from the case then this case would be a great case for you.  If you remove your phone from the case to put it in an armband or another case regularly, I wouldn't recommend this one.",

I ran the waterproofing test as directed, it worked great! No leaks. Which is big for me as that will also keep dust out of the case which really is my biggest complaint about Otterbox cases.<br /><br />As for the sturdiness of it, it seems well built in its minimalist design, however, I'm not going to try dropping it just to find out though. I have accidentally had some low drops with no damage; therefore so far, so good.<br /><br />I didn't notice any problems until I tried using the speakerphone, tried using Facetime, and tried playing video/audio over the speakers. The speaker and mic on the bottom of the 7+ are pretty much useless with this case blocking/muffling incoming and outgoing audio. I guess I shouldn't expect Lifeproof quality in every aspect at such a lower price.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good case that's why I gave it 3 stars and not 2 or 1. It does what it says. It sturdily protects the phone and keeps out water and dust, you just have to sacrifice some audio to save the money between this and a Lifeproof. I would buy it again in a pinch just like this time.<br /><br />I reported the audio issue to their customer service department who expeditiously responded with a resolution; great customer service!",

Duh. Instead of inserting the earphone into the hole (in the wrong place) you have to peel back the tab to insert the piece, exposing the phone and making it less waterproof, which if you don't live in a place where you go running in the rain then okay, but I do.

It's  too much of a pain to return this to a UPS Drop-off or Amazon locker in these days of virus so I will suck up the cost. I guess I'll try taking a knife to it to expose the phone's actual buttons. Shame, because I love the look of it and it feels good when it's on the phone. Looks like it would provide excellent protection.<br /><br />Edited to add that Frankenstein-ing the case didn't work. The hard interior shell sets the buttons too far away from the gel portion of the case to allow you to make contact. After examining the purchase I cut out, I'm still not sure why it doesn't makr contact. It appears to be lined up correctly and the depth of the rubber contacts seems correct. I can only assume the gel portion is just slightly enough distorted that it's preventing the contact to be effective.",

It has a nice grip to it when you hold it in your hand and the buttons work great every time. No finger prints, no lint on the case even when put it in and taking it out of your shorts or pants pockets. I have not dropped my phone, I do not usually drop my phones I take care of them but it is better to be safe than sorry. Works with wireless charging pads with the case on. The case also has enough protection around the front side of the case to your screen when putting down your phone screen side down on a desk or table. You can add a screen protector if you like, I do not use one since I am careful with my phones. These newer phones come with a stronger glass screens than they used to before and I have not had any issues with mine so far, no drops, no cracks, no finger prints either.

I've dropped my phone many times and they do not fall out. My cards have been very secure. Never not once a single issue. In fact we're traveling again and my husband has a Samsung phone and when he said he wanted something like this, I found that they make them for Samsung as well. His just came today and it's just as amazing as mine.<br />If you're looking for a case like this, don't hesitate! it's awesome and the lip around the screen. Protects your screen while your phone lays face down.<br />My one original concern was how well my pop socket would do and I now can confirm that even after 11 months of hard use with the pop socket in the middle of the back of my phone I've had zero issues<br />This is the best case I have ever owned!",
