This has been a great band and I'm going to look into a few more.<br /><br />The only \"con\" I've seen is that fabric can catch the end and make it come off.

They come with the little pin that you use to fit it to the back of your fitbit, and they set into the watch face pretty sturdily.  I don't know why I didn't notice the \"gems\" in the wristband, but I didn't.  I will admit that I wanted a more plain rose-gold band to replace another one that I wore out, but this one has little \"diamonds\" on each link.  I don't really care for it, but I'm not going to worry about it for now.  Pretty easy to use overall, and is sturdy for everyday use.  I might switch it out to a more daily band later though, due to the gems; they just feel a little gaudy to me.",

Plus, my other batteries have been strange sizes and shapes, so I figured this one would be a great option for things like my kindle and phone.  I do like how thin and rectangular this batter pack is, but it is a little heavier than you expect.  This charger is also really slippery, strangely enough.  I've wondered about putting a rubber sticker of some sort so that it doesn't slide when holding it with my phone or kindle.  I think that would just help it stay put when you're holding it with your device or just to keep it from sliding off the counter.  That might sound strange, but it just needs a way to stay put.

I put my tablet on it portrait was, rotated the base - no issues. (See photos) It folds up nice and compact. One of the pictures is of me holding it next to my thin Samsung remote. You can see folded up it's not very thick. I tried to upload a video of it being folded up but Amazon only allows one video per review. I felt doing the weight was important to show how sturdy it is.

My critique would be the finger print scanner. It's located on the right side of the phone and you use your thumb to unlock it. It works about half the time. The problem seems to be that phone cases get in the way, blocking the access partially. I have bought and tried two cases and both had the same issue. This is a big miss in my opinion.",

    "text": "As of this writing, only the black case was available on Amazon so I purchased the red one direct through Supcase.  I've been loyal to this brand for years and they've protected my devices from what I thought was sure destruction more times than I can remember.<br /><br />This is my first edge case, however, and my first impressions are good, but not great.  The clear back looks sharp but I question its durability.  I also have camera protectors put on and while they fit through the opening, my phone no longer lays flat as it did with the case I had on while waiting for this one to arrive.  Not a deal breaker but I wish the camera protectors, which do not add bulk, were flush to this case's backing.<br /><br />Finally, I had to remove the fingerprint \"dot\" on the inside of the screen protector for two reasons: the first being that it was touch and go with whether or not it worked; secondly (and the ultimate reason I peeled it off) the dot was too visible, impeding my viewing experience.  The dot was completely transparent but its edges let me know it was there at all times, which was very distracting.<br /><br />All in all, I love the frame of the supcases as well as its screen protectors compared to the peel-n-stick ones that come with competitor brands.  I'm going to give this one a try but I may go back to the original style that has nontranspant back plate if I feel this one's durability isn't up to the task.  It is sharp looking for sure, but at the end of the day, protecting my device is priority.  I hope this does the job.",

    "text": "If you need your iPhone to be protected then this is the case for you. If you need it to look pretty -- not so much. The case come in two parts one that protects the case then an extra rubber piece that goes over that one!! Kinda bulky so it takes away from the &#34;aesthetics&#34; of the machine. It also has a screen protector on it.<br />Pros.. a drop will NOT break your iPhone or it's screen if you have this case on. I LOVE that b/c I resell all my iPhones and I liek to know that they don't looked scuffed or marred.<br />There is also a bit of protection against water damage as many of the possible entry points are covered. -- You have flaps that cover these, and to get to the items under them you have to pull up a very strong rubber flap -- points are the mute button, charge port, and headphone jack. But not totally water proof so as always be careful.<br /><br />cons - bulky<br />Can be a bit of a pain to put on.<br />finger-print sensor is not as quick but quick enough<br />touch can be a little less responsive<br />those strong rubber flaps are really a pain.<br /><br />I'm keeping mine though. The reason is I've never understood how people take a $1000 machine with them w/out protection..the cost for this is the same as the cost to replace a screen if it broke with apple cares or regular insurance. It's still worth it though!!!",

But, the frame provides mild protection.  The feel is good.  Plus, there is easy access to the ports without interference.<br /><br />I like this because it is light and thin, without adding more bulk to the phone.  Rizzo",

    "text": "The IPhone car mount comes with two methods of mounting, one is on the car windshield, and the other on the vent.  Mounting from the windshield is much easier, but it depends on how large this mount/phone can become distracting to your windshield vision.  You can pivot the mount for landscape view of the GPS.  The arm of the mount is sturdy and the suction works well, making adjustments with confidence that it won't become dislodged.  The spring-loaded clip seems sturdy and supportive.<br /><br />The cradle for the phone is where the sound amplifying wires are located.  I think the amplifying was not much more, but a little noticeable.  The amplifying is meant to double the sound, but I did not quite experience that quality of amplification.<br /><br />Attaching this to the vents is more challenging and apparently, some vehicles provide easier attachment, and I chose the window mount.  Much better, and with a cleaner look.  But, you can choose to leave the phone in the cradle, easy to remove if needed.  ........Rizzo",

    "text": "To get a decent stand for the Iphone camera, I like this, however, be gentle with the tripod flexible legs, because if you move it too much or too hard, it can become frustrating to get the right position.  And I do like the many ways this tripod can be flexed to fit various structures, plus ability to wrap around a structure for various positioning.  But, be patient with wrapping it and having a secure hold.  And, it is easy to position for landscape or portrait shots.<br /><br />Sometimes the tripod takes some getting used to, some maneuvering around, but in time, you can become more comfortable with setting it up.<br /><br />The snap-on bumper that holds the phone is delicate, be sure you know how to snap it on and remove it.  The clip that holds the phone is also rather delicate plastic.  And, leave it on your Iphone if preferred.  There is also an adaptor that will screw on to hold a digital camera.  That is an added feature to the apparatus, to be able to hold your digital camera. The tripod is a nice feature, but I feel too much manipulating, removing and putting on, can damage the lightweight plastics.  .....Rizzo",

    "text": "So I have used this product for over a week and though I feel that it is a tough case and I like that, the rubber that goes around the edges is a little weak and rather annoying. Every time I take it out of my purse I have to make sure all of the little flaps are closed (and the one at the bottom is already having a hard time maintaining its shape) and having to open the top flap to use my headset is REALLY a design flaw. The few times I tried to put it in my pocket - forget about it - rubber slipping out of placement left and right. I will change my rating from two stars to three but if I can find a case that is as tough but with a better design I will be switching over ASAP. Sad Day.<br /><br />(PREVIOUS REVIEW): This is not a complete review. I have made one phone call with the case on. I really like this case because it seems pretty solid. (I am looking for a solid case because I bought 2 $80+ Mophie juice pack air cases because I liked the battery idea but after both of them breaking after one fall off of a counter I decided I needed something a little tougher.) Like some others have said the rubber feels a little wimpy (again, I have not had the chance to throw it in my purse and see if it survives) and it sure collects cat hair but who cares. So here it is: I have to write and give a bad review because I cannot believe this problem exists and it is a deal breaker for me. The top flap that goes over the hole where the headphones plug in doesn't line up with the hole on the phone itself.<br /><br />To clarify, if you are looking at the top of the phone without the case on it, it looks like this:<br />._____________________<br />[_O__._|______===____]<br /><br />And with the case on the hole is here:<br />._____________________<br />[____O_|______===____]<br /><br />To use the head-set I would have to open the flap and plug in the headset with the flap bent back. To some this might be no problem at all but if I buy a product it should work without jerry-rigging, and since I use the headset all of the time this inability to quickly plug it in without fiddling with little flaps is not ok. And yes, before some yell at me - I know that the hole they have there is probably intended for the little noise cancelling microphone that is next to the jack but that still doesn't change the fact that one has to prop open the rubber flap, thus stretching the chintzy rubber even more So...I wrote to the company to see if this is just a problem with this batch or if this is just a design flaw and I should shop elsewhere. I will update this review as things happen.",

However, sometimes you need a quick boost, as in you've been using your phone all day, especially when times get busy at work, and you suddenly realize it's one o'clock, you have a meeting at two, and your phone battery is down to 20%. This plug has a quick-charge feature, like the \"Turbo-Power\" plugs that Motorola provides with their cell phones, where you are guaranteed a full charge in about fifteen or twenty minutes, so this is perfect for those times when you've only got a short time to charge. Plus the plug folds back so that you can just toss it in a backpack or purse.<br /><br />Please note that the charging cord connections in this plug are USB C, NOT standard USB. You will have to get a charge cord with USB C at either end (or with USB C at one end and USB micro at the other, if you are still using a gadget that uses micro USB) to work with it.",

I considered one of the popups, but you really need two fingers to control those properly, and these you can stick one finger in and you're good to go. This is a lifesaver at the grocery store, when I am using Publix's terrific app where it tells you where each of your shopping list items are aisle by aisle. I can hold the phone with my forefinger and middle finger, check off the shopping list with my thumb, and still push the grocery cart with my right hand.",

    "text": "I ordered another fine-point capacative stylus like this last  year. I also liked that one, but it was quite quirky and turned off too quickly. This one is better: it stays on longer and is longer in length so it fits all but the hugest \"paw.\" The blue light that indicates power is easier to see, and I like the rubber cap for the point and also the cover for the charging port, although the magnetic attraction on the latter is not strong enough. If you put the rubber point cap over the charging port cover while you're using the stylus, when you pull the rubber point off it it takes the cover right off.<br /><br />Again, my complaint is that there is NOTHING to attach this stylus to your tablet. Pens have pen clips, why doesn't this thing? Included with my stylus was a \"gift\" of two square flaps of stiff vinyl, with an elastic loop on each. This elastic loop fits around the stylus, so I take it it's supposed to be some sort of gadget to keep the stylus with the tablet, but I can't really figure out how it's supposed to work, unless you're supposed to tuck it under the tablet in your tablet case and then fold the tablet cast closed around it (if your tablet case allows that), but I don't know, because they came with no instructions.<br /><br />I don't suppose the darn thing could beep or something before it decides it's not been used enough and powers down. It is very aggravating when you are working with it, pause to think, and it shuts down and you think your tablet  has frozen instead.<br /><br />I must say that this stylus is very accurate in use with drawing. Other styluses that I have used start their lines a millimeter or two to the right or left of the actual pen point; this is pretty accurate! If you are just goofing off trying to trace a photo, it makes your drawing come out very nice indeed.<br /><br />Pros: Long, light, accurate, very sensitive to touch<br /><br />Cons: No PEN CLIP, no shutoff warning, connector cover magnet weak.<br /><br />And please, how do I properly use the \"gift\" that comes with the stylus?",

    "text": "I was talked into getting a Google Pixel when they first came out. Let's say I was less than enchanted with it, and I still refer to it as \"U.P.\" (Useless Phone). One of the things I missed from my previous phone, a Droid Turbo, was the ability to use a feature called USB on the Go. This meant you could plug a thumb drive with the proper connection into the charging port and you could therefore copy files from the thumb drive to the phone and vice versa. I was astonished that you could not also do this with the fancy, much vaunted upon Pixel.<br /><br />Over the years I have bought several of these double connector thumb drives (with a regulation USB connector at one end and a USB-C type connector at the other) in the vain hope that the newest model would connect with this daft Pixel, but no dice. Still hoping, I ordered this Leizhan thumb drive, which, once again, worked perfectly with my computer, but the stupid Pixel would not read the drive, even though it now had a different, upgraded version of the operating system than when I bought it.<br /><br />And then...I asked for help again on the Pixel assistance board, and someone advised me what to do (it involved going into a setting menu and changing something), and this lovely flash drive FINALLY WORKS with my phone. I can't believe how long it took to get this to happen.<br /><br />The drive is great; very fast, plugs securely into both the computer and into the phone. I am very pleased!",

    "title": "I Can't Get This to Work; Am I Doing Something Wrong? UPDATED",
    "text": "My original review of this is below. I received a stylus that did not work. I contacted Vine about this and they sent me a new one immediately. Thank you, Vine personnel!<br /><br />The reason I wanted to try this one is that most styluses are so clumsily tipped! They just have a big soft nub of rubber and when you are working on a small screen as on a 7-inch tablet or a phone it will pick two letters or two numbers at the time on a virtual keyboard. I have gone crazy looking for something with a tinier stylus tip and this looked good. I thought if this worked out I would buy another for my husband, who is constantly complaining that his stylus tip is too large.<br /><br />In general I like this. I charged it overnight, then unplugged, turned it on and it worked without me needing to twist the tip to adjust the signal. It works on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, both 7\" and 10\" versions, and also on my Pixel phone (and that is such a temperamental little twit that a lot of things don't work with it). Sadly, the stylus doesn't seem to work as well on my touch-screen Acer Windows laptop, but I have only tried it in one program that was not made for use with a pen. It might work on another app better.<br /><br />I've only been using it to read magazines and do some cleanup work on files on my tablet, so I haven't explored it totally. I tried downloading a drawing program on the 10\" tablet, but the pen didn't work that well, but the app wasn't rated that well, either, and it didn't work that well with my normal stylus, either. I did find if I used it while I was reading and didn't turn pages fast enough, it goes into standby mode and then I wonder why it's not working until I realize the light is not on. I need to test it further on something like an app that lets you use handwriting input.<br /><br />What I really, really dislike about this stylus is that there is no way to fasten it to ANYTHING. It has no clip so you can clip it to your pocket or to your tablet case, or a ring so you can put a \"leash\" on it. It's not even magnetic. If I gave one to my husband he would promptly lose it! What's with the no clip or no method of keeping it leashed??? Even a cheap Bic pen has a clip!<br /><br />====================================================<br /><br />I charged this via a USB plug. I noticed immediately that the charging cord plug does not go all the way into the stylus; there is still a sixteenth of an inch of the charging cord plug showing. It went from red to blue and charged all night. But when I took it off the charger and pressed the button to turn it on, there was no light. I take it a light is supposed to come on when you press the button and will stay on until the battery runs down and it will turn red. I get no light at all.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this. Did I do something wrong? Was overnight (12 hours) too short to charge it? Is it because the mini-USB plug does not go all the way in the pen? I have tried all ways pressing the button.<br /><br />Is there any way to get one that WORKS????",

They seem to be as responsive as the Adonit even if the small circular clear plastic nib appears to be on a rubbery flexible thick strand of rubber rather than the metal point in the Adonit. The Meko has a nice grip handle as well as a pen clip that will actually go on the cover of my tablet. You also have a mesh-covered regular stylus at the other end.<br /><br />Note: I am not using this for drawing, just for reading books on my tablets, so I do not know if they have the fine control for artwork.

    "text": "I am flat-out in love with this phone. We had gone into the Verizon store intending to get Samsung Galaxy 5 phones, but they were offering this phone for \"free\" (with 2-year renewal, of course) and when the representative heard we were looking for good battery life she recommended the Droid Turbo. We started out with Droid phones for our first smartphone, and we really liked them. These were upgraded to a Galaxy Nexus; our first two were so bad (husband's rebooted constantly, and mine kept locking up) we had to return them for replacements. The Galaxy Nexus was a useful phone, but it ate battery way out of proportion of what I did with it. We had to have two spare batteries just to get through a long day at a SF convention.<br /><br />But I've never been \"in love\" with a phone until this Turbo. The battery life isn't what the specs say, but I can play podcasts all day, check the weather, send texts, make calls, use Waze and still have battery life at the end of the day without having to charge it; sometimes it doesn't go under 50 percent. That is downright amazing compared to the old Nexus. I love the Moto Voice feature in which you address the phone with a customized pass phrase and it will call someone on your contact list, look up the temperature outside, post to Facebook, and/or feed you the headlines. The screen is absolutely gorgeous; from photographs on Facebook to YouTube videos to the icons on your screen, the picture is sharp-edged and brilliant with vivid colors. The response time is quick. The camera isn't bad at all, except for a slightly slow response time, and I frequenly find myself leaving my camera behind for small parties and close-up photography because the phone app does the job so well. Sound is good considering it's a phone and I can finally hear it; I could turn the Nexus up to full volume and still not be able to make out what was being said.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, there's nothing this phone can't do, or I haven't run into it yet.",

    "text": "Last year on our vacation, both my husband and I brought our netbooks with us. Going through airport security with them was annoying: they had to be pulled from their cases, turned on, then returned to their cases while we also juggled putting on shoes, a purse, hubby's C-PAP unit, and our coats. Since I had a blog function on my Droid (Droid 1, aka the Milestone), I grumbled that all I would have needed was a keyboard for the thing, like the Stowaway keyboard I used to have with my HP Jornada: I used to be able to get on chat via a plug in modem, post to my blog, even work on a short story if desired.<br /><br />So it was with anticipation and, yes, a bit of skepticism that I purchased this Freedom Pro keyboard after reading the reviews here, after noting that most of the negative reviews had to do with Droid Evo units.<br /><br />I give many thanks to the reviewer \"Daniel\" who posted such clear advice about setting up this keyboard with Android drivers and for the link to the instructional video. Except for one bobble, which was my fault for not reading the directions clearly enough, these instructions made the setup quite easy and I was typing in no time.<br /><br />I was pleased with the keyboard, which is stronger and much more substantial than the Stowaway I had for my PDA. I do not feel I have to \"bang\" on the keys to get this product to respond. The hideway stand for the Droid is also quite useful.<br /><br />Yes, because this is a foldaway unit and meant to be small, the keys are not precisely where they would be on a normal computer keyboard, and some keys are smaller. The shift key at right is particularly small. However, this is perfectly useful for note taking, blogging, posts to Facebook, and any other small typing chores you wish to do on your smartphone. You may not be able to get up to 60 wpm, or write the Great American Novel on it, but for small writing tasks it is very useful.",

    "text": "The PEACHTRON 3 in 1 Wireless Magnetic Charger arrived as described nicely package with no issues.  Overall, it is a descent product but design could be improved to support an ultra and additional weight for stability.<br /><br />Once unpacked, I inspected the charging station and found no physical defeat.  It is light weight and could be heavier, compact…travel friendly.  The nightlight is a plus and worked very well.  I had no issues with the touch button that operates the light.<br /><br />The watch charging pad does not support an Ultra so, I can't attest to the  functionality of this feature.<br /><br />The iPhone MagSafe and AirPods charging pad works well with no issues.  It charged but in a reasonable amount of time. The magnetic force for the phone charging station is strong and had no issues holding an iPhone 12 or 12pro.  Some additional weight due to the magnetic force would improve stability. Multiple times my son has taken the stand with him when trying to remove his phone in a rush.",

    "title": "It's ok…fits well, but I believe  protection claims are overstated.",
    "text": "BEASTEK for iPhone 12 Waterproof Case is an ok case for the price and intent.  I got this for my 13 year old Son's phone.  I like having a robust case given his age and the mag safe feature is something he had been wanting.  The extent of protection as claimed in the ad I question though.<br /><br />My two major complaints would be the plastic liner that covers the switch to cycle silent mode.  The plastic linear works so far and currently is “water resistant” but over time I believe this could be a failure point.  Second is the muffled sound. This hinders quality but I expected there would be a lose in speaker sound quality due to design.  You can't cover a speaker that emits sounds waves that vibrate and not expect a drop in quality.<br /><br />Material used for the is case is average. The case itself is not bulky and feels good in my hand.  I have a tempered glass screen protector on his phone and  the case works fine even with the built in one.  He has had no degraded touch capabilities.  Charging the phone works with no issue on a mag safe and regular wireless charger.<br /><br />Picture/video quality appears the same as without the lens covers. However, smudges will appear on lens covers.  Be aware of this prior to taking pictures or videos.<br /><br />Overall, it is an ok case that provides protection.  I have had no issues as of yet with design or functionality however, my biggest gripe…does the level of protection meet the stated claims in the ad. I do not know nor do I want to find out.  None are substantiated by quantitative data.<br /><br />Value wise the price is appropriate based on design and quality.  I have no issues with that.<br /><br />Interesting info to better inform others.<br /><br />They use the term waterproof but the rating referenced “IP68” uses the term water resistant and only to 1.5 meters (4 feet 11 inches) for 30 minutes.  It is water resistant as I tested in my sink but as stated in the ad I would not want to find out if it meets the claimed depth.<br /><br />Per ad “Safe in water under 33ft even after 1000 times test of using for one hour exceeding IP68 rating, great protection for any underwater activities or outdoor/daily use”.<br /><br />Also, I believe the case does provide drop protection.  Whether it was dropped 1000 times from 9ft and survived as stated…I will believe it when they provide me the test report.  FYI, 810G, method 516 is shock testing and not stated is which procedure was used for the testing.  Was it functional shock, transport shock?  I can tell you the test specification do not call out dropping the test article 1000 times no matter what procedure is used.  Again, show me the data.<br /><br />Per ad “Full body protection designed to exceed Military Standard 810G-516, guard your phone even after 1000 times drop from 9.9ft/3m height”.",

I use it with a Spigen Mag Armor case.  The magnetic force is strong, almost too strong.<br /><br />Watch station has the magnetic pad included and is strong enough to hold my Ultra watch with case and rugged alpine band.  Again, no complaints.<br /><br />AirPods station charges just as well as the to previous I mentioned.  I used my son AirPods with a protective case and it charged with no issues.<br /><br />The charging times listed in the ad are accurate within reason.  It charges fast.<br /><br />The stand itself is well constructed from quality material.  The only things that could improve the stand is adding more weight in the base.  Due to the magnetic charging I find myself taking the stand with my phone sometimes if I jerk it off too quickly.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with the product.  It works great and I can't complain.  It has exceeded my expectations and this something I recommend to others.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect but this is a well designed multi-use charging station.  This is great for travel which I do often for work and pleasure.  It easily folds up and packs in a carry on bag or small backpack.<br /><br />Up front my two complaints.  Charging port is in the front and not in the back.  Should be one in back for charging or at least the side. Second there are no non-skid pads on the bottom. That is an oversight and should have been in the design.  It slides easily on smooth surfaces.<br /><br />So, the product came nicely package no flaws or functionality issues.  Once unpacked I read the direction and charged the station.<br /><br />Once charged, the station quickly charged my iPhone 12, ultra Watch and AirPods Pro's at the same time.  My ultra watch has a cover on it but it's the type that clips on…it's the 4 Pack Smiling Case and Screen Protector.  Also, I just slide the loop around the bank to charge my watch instead of removing the band. I can't comment on other style watch covers and if they will work with the charging pad. The battery bank itself also charged quickly.  I have charged and discharged the battery bank twice to charge all my items twice until the bank was dead.<br /><br />Overall, It is well build and designed.  Heavier than I expected but that is ok with me. The entire item is made of durable plastic.  The mag charger station for the phone works well and is strong.  The arm is not flimsy.  My only issues is why is the charging port for the battery bank in the front and no non-skid pads on the bottom to prevent it from sliding.<br /><br />Note, this will also be useful when outdoors such as hiking or camping. Even just keeping in a car for an emergency is not out of the question.  You never know when you may need to charge your phone.  I will take this with me when I go hiking or scuba diving in remote areas.<br /><br />As long as the battery bank continues to function like it has I consider it a great buy and worth the price.  If I have issues I will update this review.",

It was semi comfortable to wear, see below and the Velcro hooks securely adheres to the piles.<br /><br />The only issues that stood out to me were the size of the metal buckle.  It is large and the placement of the buckle landed it on the inside of my wrist resting near my bone and it slightly irritated me.  I could possibly contribute this due to my small, skinny wrist.  Also, the band connectors when slide into the watch body are loose and do not fit as tight as an Apple Watch band, see video.  The connectors stay secure but it did concerns me.  I want others to be aware of this, especially since this is advertised as a rugged use band.",

It can be done in seconds with no annoying clips.<br /><br />The 2 in 1 structure fits together nicely. The shock sleeve is soft but very durable and ridged.  It will hold up to use and not become flimsy or lose it shape.  The outer shell provides nice protection without making the case bulky or heavy.  It still fit nicely in my hand once I installed it.<br /><br />All cuts outs, buttons align perfectly and do not hinder functionality. The tempered glass screen protector I have installed on my phone was not affect by the case.<br /><br />The raised edge depth created by the case is great and provides an ample lip to help avoid surface contact and protection if dropped.  Especially, the camera lens area which is a worry of mine.<br /><br />I had no issues when wireless charger my phone and I tried the case with multiple chargers.<br /><br />For the price you can't beat the protection it provides.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:bafd7f783d0934f7b55c572bd5c9367d]] *Update* I have wear for sometime now with no issues due to the loose connectors.<br /><br />First, I really like the band but the loose connections at the watch are a concern to me.  However, with that said I have went for a run, washed the car, did chores with no failure. The connections have held.  I don't know if the connections being loose is a one off or an actually quality control/escapement issue.<br /><br />I do not have an apple trail loop so I cannot directly compare to the OEM.  I purchased my watch with with the nylon rugged loop. I do have other apple sport loop bands which I did use for comparison.<br /><br />So, with that said. I like the look and feel of the band.  The material used is soft and the stitching seems to be well done.  The Velcro pads are securely attached to the band.  That leads me to my first issue which is the bond created by the Velcro hooks and piles.  It doesn't seem to be as strong as I would have expected and compared to my Apple sport loop band.  At this point, I haven't had any issues with it as of yet the Velcro stay secure.  As the material wears some I assume it may become stronger.<br /><br />My biggest concern is the connections points and how loosely they attach to the watch.  As you can see in the video the fit is loose and beyond what I consider reasonable.  I did compare this to my Apple sport loop band and the connectors were tight at the watch with no wiggle.<br /><br />Overall, the band is an affordable alternative to the more expensive Apple trail loop.",

I do not have another band similar but it met my expectations.<br /><br />Size:  I do not have the biggest wrist at 7”. The normal size says it fits 6.5” but I would say 6.85” to 7” would be the lower end of the spectrum.  If it is a little big nylon can shrink some under heat, such as in a dryer.  I plan to soak mine in hot water and give it a tumble wrapped in a towel.<br /><br />Also,  upon initially wearing I notice the nylon is stiff but that is normal when new. It takes wearing to loosen it up.<br /><br />My only concern is the coating on the stainless steel metal components. I wonder how well the coating will stand up to basic wear.  So far so good on that.",

    "text": "This is well designed and all featured functioned as you would expect.  The product came nicely packaged with clear instructions including pictures.  Overall, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Watch charging pad:<br />As you can see by the pictures the wire is routed behind the phone charging pad and in the base.  Note it has a USB-C and A port. Good thinking by the designers since the charging cable for the watch has two options.  It charged my watch with no problems and quickly…I have a 49mm ultra watch for reference.  Note the unit uses the charging pad/cable that comes with the watch.<br /><br />Phone charging pad:<br />I have no complaints, there is plenty of room for my iPhone 12 Pro and the watch.  FYI, I have a Body Glove Tidal waterproof case and my phone charged with no issues.  My son's generic case also worked with the charging pad.<br /><br />AirPod charging pad:<br />AirPods are not pictured, but it did charge without issue my son AirPods Pro gen2 with a silicone case.<br /><br />The touch led power switch worked without issue.  The light at the base of the unit is bright.<br /><br />I recommend this product as a good buy and consider it worth the price.",

    "text": "Awesome Otterbox clone, reminds me of a defender case.  This is a two piece case with 2 screen protectors…not tempered glass.  Case is still a great value even though screen protector isn't tempered glass.<br /><br />The case is well made, the inner hard shell has soft rubber material on the inside to prevent slippage and wear while your phone is in the case. The iPhone 12 fit tight in the inner hard shell, which snaps together easily. The outer sleeve is rubber but made from a robust and highly durable material in my opinion.  It appears it could stand up to wear and tear.  This also is a very tight fit in the inner hard shell.<br /><br />The screen protector is easily applied and the hard inner shell case can act as a guide during application.  Note it is not a tempered glass screen protector.  If you already have a screen protector on your phone the case won't interfere with it.  Update…I did put a tempered glass screen protector on the phone after the fact.<br /><br />Wireless charging worked with no issues on two different chargers.  The should hold up well.",

    "text": "I have been using this product for a week now.  After taking it out of the box I was unimpressed and after using the product I was still left unimpressed.  The product has quality, functionality and design issues. I tested the products functionality out using my iPhone 12 and AirPods Pros.  Note, I have an Ultra 49MM watch and the product was not designed for that size according to the ad.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The charging unit is very light and compact.  Due to this there may be charging issues when just charging an apple watch.  You may also have issues charging a phone and watch at the same time depending on phone/case, watch/case (see pictures).  The time is only in 24hrs, and this is noted in the product description.  The UNITEK LED light touch power button worked intermittently along with the touch alarm bottom.  This was frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />The look of the unit I like...modern slim design that does take up much space.  However, the material it is made out seems of low quality and is likely reflected in the price of the unit.  Just be aware of that if you buy.<br /><br />iPhone Charging:<br /><br />Did what it said it would and charged my phone in a reasonable amount of time.  I do have a case on my phone (Body Glove Tidal).  It will charge vertically and horizontally.  You may need to adjust the phones position to get it to start charging.<br /><br />Air Pods Pros:<br /><br />Similar results with my Air Pods Pros.  They did charge through the silicone case that I have on the OEM hardcase.  Again, in a reasonable amount of time and same as above with adjusting the position to start charging.<br /><br />iWatch:<br /><br />The charging pad for the watch is where the design comes into question.  It rotates out from behind the base.  It is poorly designed in my opinion, and I consider it flimsy.  The magnet is not as powerful as an apple magnet, so be aware your watch could fall off if you have a heavy case or band. Since this is a cantilever design the weight could also make the base wobble and tilt to the side if you try charging without your phone on it (my 49mm made is tilt to the side).  In addition, note the distant you have between my phone and watch pad in the picture (I do not have a max).  It is close and I don't see how you would get both on easily.  You would have to shift the phone over. My 49MM would not fix on the pad with my phone on the charger.  The watch charging pads seems to have been a design after thought.",

It helps me keep a secure grip on the phone.  All of the cutouts fit perfectly.  The case also has rubber closures for the stylus and charging receptacle.  The stylus bumper came off during installation.  The rubber charging bumper is a little hard to open, but I attribute that to being new.

So, I came here and read customer reviews.<br /><br />This case fits perfectly.  It's snug, lightweight (doesn't add a lot of weight to the phone) and appears durable.  I live the metal bumper.  I adds to my sense of security.  The clear back let's the beauty of the S 20 shine through.  I haven't tested the durability, no drops, but it sure makes me feel secure.  Like some other reviewers, I wish the case had more protection for the camera lens on the back, but I found a solution at Best Buy.  This case is a great value and good protection for your mobile.",

It got the job done but by nature of it being a phone on a bendable rod, you have to deal with a little bit of shaking (but you can always steady it and it won't shake after that). It's not fun to reposition the rod, but like I said, it got the job done. That is until tonight when I moved it toward me like I'd been doing for the past 5 months and it just... quit, lol. The rod is still attached to the base but it falls to whatever side net weight is on. I think it was less than $15 so that's not horrible for 5 months, but now I have to buy something else and I think I'm going to look outside of Saiji (this is my second Saiji product).<br /><br />Second update: After this one broke, I got a Lamicall one and it's soooo much better! The Saiji one moves at the base every time you move it and so you have to readjust it A LOT. The movement causes it to completely detach from its fixture every so many bends. But the Lamicall one has is much more fixed PLUS it has a neck-like apparatus which allows you to adjust the top of the wand without moving the bottom of the wand, thus keeping the base fixed.

I did have glass covers but they smudged pretty easy, and degraded the quality of the pics a bit.<br />The only thing about this case is that I have a tough time MagSafe charging. I don't know if it's that the magnet isn't strong enough or the charge can't go through the case as well… it will charge with MagSafe but you have to be mindful that the lightning bolt is lit up (on the phone) is on because it doesn't always hit the right spot or something. Other than that… this case is perfect! If the MagSafe piece isn't that important to you… this case is perfect.",

I have bought several other items from OUTXE and have always had excellent service - and the products are excellent. The ring for the phone is great to steady the phone - the most that can be asked for a magnet... it's just not the same as one that is stuck to the case with an adhesive.<br /><br />I use mine to steady my camera BUT… it can't be counted on to help you not drop your phone like a regular ring. The magnet is strong when you are just resting it in your hand - and is a great kickstand… but if you turn your phone at all when your finger is in the ring it pops off. It is perfectly understandable why this happens (that's how you take it off) … just saying … if you are used to a ring that uses an adhesive where you can spin your phone while taking a shot… you can drop your phone.",

I don't like that the plastic on this case feels very cheap and flimsy but I needed something cause the defender case I was using made the phone very bulky feeling and I couldn't get it in my jacket pocket without having to fight with it to get my phone in my pocket which is why I jumped on buying this case. I know everything in the mall is always more expensive just because its the mall. The guy originally told me it was $35 and when I told him I didn't have enough to buy it right now he told me he will sell it to me for $25 if I really wanted to buy it, so I bought it. My only issue besides the price I paid for it is what I mentioned above about the plastic not being of a good quality. I get nervous that the belt clip for it is going to break if used to often which I don't normally do during the winter months but come spring and summer I will be using it everyday.",

It was exactly what I was looking for at a decent price. Arrived in two days, a whole day ahead of FedEx' estimation<br /><br />Pros: - Metal Construction.<br />  - Comes with an extra tip.<br />  - The pen is hollow and unscrews in such a way to insert the tip safely inside the shell and protect it while not in use.<br />  - Feels, looks, and performs like a quality instrument.<br />  - Tip is a soft transparent rubber disc that protects Tablet glass but doesn't obscure your work.<br />  - Cost is very reasonable.<br /><br />Cons:- First tip came apart after a week days of heavy multiuser use.

It is very light so it will fall over easily, like if my cats bump into it.  I've only used it indoors so I've never had to weigh it down.  The remote paired easily and still works.  I only have to charge it once in awhile.  I think this is more geared to be a tripod than a selfie stick.  As a selfie stick it is difficult for me to hold and is uncomfortable since I have small hands and it's a little heavy for me.  You're basically holding the 3 legs folded up in your hand so it's really bulky for me.  So, I just use this mostly for the tripod to take pictures and video calls.  All in all it's a decent product but I have to buy a selfie stick that has a smaller diameter grip.  I wish it would've worked as both equally.",

A few days before it arrived, I got an e-mail from the company and had a link to videos on how to apply it to the phone.  It was extremely helpful.  I was able to put a new screen protector on my husband's iPhone (the old screen protector had quite a few bubbles) and I managed to almost have it perfect.  There were some very small bubbles but they weren't on the screen so he didn't mind.  He also liked the way it doesn't leave fingerprints.  I applied one to my iPhone and I had one bubble due to a spec of dust.  Even so, it was hardly noticeable.  I was going to leave it but I'm kind of OCD so I used my last one and that one I got PERFECT.  No bubbles at all.  The only con I have with it is that viewing pictures aren't as sharp anymore but at the cost of not having to clean the screen every five minutes, I can live with it.  Other than that, I absolutely love it and would recommend it to others.  Quick tip...air cans work wonders.",

Overall, I have to say that I'm pretty satisfied with the case and would give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />One of the things that attracted me to this particular case was its military drop protection feature. I'm pretty clumsy and have dropped my phone more times than I care to admit, so I wanted a case that would give me some peace of mind in case of a mishap. So far, I haven't dropped my phone with this case on, but it definitely feels sturdy and well-made, so I'm confident it would hold up well in a fall.<br /><br />I also appreciate that the case hasn't yellowed yet. I've had clear cases in the past that have started to look dingy and discolored after just a few weeks of use, but this one still looks crystal clear. That being said, I do notice some smudges and fingerprints on the back of the case, which can be a bit annoying.<br /><br />The hard back and soft TPU bumpers provide good protection, but I do wish the case was a little thicker or had a more substantial feel to it. It's quite slim and lightweight, which is nice for carrying in my pocket, but it doesn't give me as much confidence in its protection abilities as some bulkier cases might.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a solid case for the price. It offers good protection, doesn't yellow, and looks nice on my phone. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a clear case that provides some added drop protection.",

I previously had used acrylic and plastic phone stands, but they always tipped over. When they first released an adjustable one (silver stand), I fell more in love with the brand. The adjustable quality make video calling and video watching on my phone so much easier. My boyfriend recently got a large phone that's fairly thick with a case on it. I knew I wanted to buy him an OMOTON stand and was intrigued by this current model and thought it would work well for him.<br /><br />This model (black stand in the photo) sits lower than the previous model and is heavy duty enough to accommodate his phone without tipping over. His phone can fit into my silver stand, but the fact that the stand sits lower allows him to easily rest his phone without it tipping forward if he angles it too low. The one and only con I have with the current model (black stand) is that the hinge doesn't move as smoothly as the previous version I purchased for myself (silver stand). If I were to be extra picky, I would say the material because more light weight compared to the other models, but it doesn't affect the durability of the product. I highly recommend this model if you have a very large phone, but otherwise I would recommend the previous model (silver) for that smooth sliding hinge.",

No way was I going to be stuck with this phone on a 2 year contract with it looking busted like most people I knew who owned an Iphone. I went to Best Buy and overpaid for an Otterbox case and an overpriced screen protector.

I dropped my phone getting out of my car on the first day of putting all these gadgets on.

I've had a few drops with this, but my gosh this is great! No scratches or cracks anywhere! And the pink blends beautifully with the rose phone color. Definitely worth the money and it's a pretty slim case too.",

There is a LED display that shows the percentage of charge left on the device, during and after use.

First, while assembling the charging stand is pretty simple (you just screw in the parts), it is somewhat inconvenient. So beware, this equipment requires some assembly on the part of the purchaser. Once that is completed, it looks really cool but there are some basic things that I would change. It does not come with a charging brick (portion that goes into the wall), so if you expect this stand to come with everything you need it doesn't. You will have to locate one which seems to defeat the purpose. If you purchased this device to replace a lost or broken one, you'll still need to order the brick separately. And to charge it, you must be plugged into a USB. I also notice that the wire or charging cord does not stay in the charger very well. And while none of these things by themselves is a big deal, in the totality of things it makes this product less attractive.

    "text": "The Under Armour cell phone case, fits my sons 6s Plus like a glove. He likes the look – all black and rugged. I like the fact that there are ridges (or indentions) along the sides of the case which seem to help with gripping. Unlike the sleek/slippery design like those that tend to slip out of your hand but instead allows you to grip your device securely. I think this will definitely appeal to the average consumer. This case appears to be well made, durable and doesn't seem to pick up dirt or fingerprints easily. In conclusion, for a small investment (under $40), Under Armour (with UA Protector grip) appears to have everything you need: durability and a ton of protection (even drop protection). Overall, this is a pretty decent phone case and I would recommend it.",

    "text": "In my opinion, the LeEco-LeS3 is pretty sweet.<br />Let me explain my reasoning.<br />First, I view technology (i.e., laptops, cellphones, etc.) as a necessity. It is incorporated in every facet of our lives. And in terms of cellphones, I tend to stick with the android. I like their functionality, ease of use and simplicity. Simply stated, I need a phone for dummies. I will say that I have never owned an iPhone (an iPad and Nano, yes but not an iPhone), so my perspective will be strictly from that of an android user. So when offered this unlocked 32gb smartphone, I had high hopes that I would both like the phone and find some of these same features that I enjoy. Overall, I haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />Things that I like:<br />1. The LeS3 is stylish and sleek. Looks great and feels great in the hand.<br />2. It has the traditional/typical smartphone features.<br />3. My carrier is TMobile, so this unlocked version worked well. All I had to do was change the size of my sim card (my previous phone was the LG stylo) and I was good to go.<br />4. Setting up my phone was pretty easy, with the exception of scanning the bar code. I never did figure out how to do that. I wasn't able to perform that feature.<br />5. This phone came with: a charger, ear-buds, an adaptor and even a case (although it is just a clear plastic one, it was nice not to have to go out immediately and buy one). Knowing my phone had some protection right out the box was a plus.<br />6. This phone connects to my Bluetooth (a Jabra) better than my previous one. It automatically connects once I put it in my ear versus my previous phone that frequently disconnected.<br />7. The camera feature is decent. My pictures are crisp and clear.<br />8. The battery life is great. That of course might change as time goes on. But for now, running Words with Friends, Facebook etc, I use less than 25% of my battery life during the day.<br />9. This phone is affordable, especially if you compare it to some products on the market.<br /><br />Things that I am still not sure about:<br />1. The barcode scanning feature never worked. If that is an important feature, make it easier to use.<br />2. (MOST TROUBLING) This phone heats up. Of course I was able to download a super cleaner ap that cools the device, but I still don't understand why it gets hot.<br />With all that being said, in terms of style, ease of set-up and features, I give this camera a 4, having deducted a star for the cons.",

It is smooth to the touch and makes swyping easy. It also protects my screen. My only complaint is that the corners (top right and bottom left) have started lifting slightly. I think the reason that this is happening is because my case does not come all the way down which would hold the cover more securely. With the exception of this, this cover does exactly what it is suppose to do......it keeps fingerprints off the face of the phone and offers protections from getting scratches on your screen. I highly recommend the IQ Shield LiquidSkin as long as you are mindful of this when you are researching what kind of cover your intend to purchase.",

    "text": "I have purchased several Belkin products over the years. Traditionally they are a company that I have come to trust when purchasing accessories for various electronics. I have used Belkin products to secure my IPODs when working out, or even purchased the iWatchz Wrist Strap for my son's nano that he wears like a wrist watch. Regardless, when I saw that this was being offered, I thought that my son would enjoy having one to change up with from time to time depending on the occasion. Unfortunately, this was not the product that I should have ordered. Neither the quality or the look was what I have come to like about the Belkin brand. The nano attaches easily to the band, and while this product definitely looks boyish (i.e., masculine), it doesn't really look rugged or durable. I don't think that this particular style would appeal to ladies or even young girls. It isn't really cute and attractive. The band on-line or in photos looks a lot better than what it looked like in person. The picture was deceptive. While the picture makes the finished product look sleek and smart, it actually looks a little bulky and clunky. The band attaches by Velcro and to me doesn't really seem secure, especially if you are working out or running. If you hit the closure even a little bit, it loosens and doesn't remain secure.<br /><br />Was this product affordable? Not really. For the price, I think you can find something a little more affordable, practical and definitely more attractive. Paying a little more for something that will last a little longer and that you will be happier with, would probably be worth it.<br /><br />Attractiveness - 1<br />Price- 1<br />Durable - 1",

As a college student I kept forgetting to transfer my wallet back from my backpack to my purse when I would go to work so I kept driving without an ID which I didn't realize until I was halfway there already. I wanted a wallet case but I didn't like the ones that were open for fear of cards falling out. I purchased the \"dreamcatcher\" design cause it's hard to find cute cases for android. I love it it holds my ID and debit card which is perfect for me. Fits 2 cards easily if you carry more I would maybe invest in a actual wallet case but if you just need 2-3 cards this is a great option. I've had it for over a year and it's still in great condition I've had no issues. Color did fade off a bit on the 4 corners but I'm really not picky plus the middle which has the design is still in perfect condition so overall I am very happy with my purchase and will be buying another very soon so I can switch it up every once in a while!:)",

    "text": "At first, I was prepared to receive a low quality phone stand because of the price, which was around $10. I originally thought that maybe it would've been a hard plastic type, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The moment I opened up the package, I was at an awe. I absolutely love mine! I was very impressed with the quality of this product. It's all metal and very sturdy. I use this all of the time. It is difficult to move when adjusting, but it's a good difficult because when you position it to the angle you want, it stays in its place until you physically move it again. You can easily type on your phone without the phone budging. I bought this in Rose Gold to match the color of my iPhone 7 Plus. There was one thing that I noticed that could be improved. I ended up purchasing a small piece of rubber from a craft store and I cut th piece to the size of the bottom (just a little less on all sides so that the rubber doesn't hang off the sides and to collect debris. Anyway, I glued it on the bottom of the stand so that I could also do Facebook Live videos and still be able to type comments without the stand sliding on desks, counter tops or any other smooth surfaces. It also helps in the kitchen while you're working on dinner and on Allrecipes and only have one free “clean” finger so that you can scroll down the ingredients to the recipe without the stand moving. It's a very easy and inexpensive fix and now I have the stand that I've always wanted and have been using now for a little over 5 months. I will be ordering other ones soon and add my little “fix” unless the sellers decide to add it LOL and possibly sending them out as gifts to other family members and friends. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this product and I hope this review helps others.",

But it's not too bad!! (Unless you have really small hands)<br />The stand in the case isn't that great, it'll keep your phone up, but at an angle  to where sometimes it's not even worth having the stand.<br />All the button covers are perfect!!! They do their job and there is no complaints about those!!<br />The vibrate switch on your phone is definitely something you have to play around with to get it switch on or off. Not hard to reach but can be an obstacle to move on and off with the case.<br />Now, DURABILITY, I can definitely tell you that this case can take some hits to the ground from maybe 3 to 4 feet. The only probable is that it's only good sometimes for one or two hits then it'll break either all at once or piece by piece. Mine lasted me for about 2 weeks at max. It's definitely a good buy for something temporary when you don't have the money to buy a really good case!!  I'd say worth a try!! Maybe you'll have a different experience! But only if you acknowledge that this case may be something temporary as in no more than a month!  You get what you pay For.  I was content for the most part.

Not able to find the glass protector, I purchased a hard shell cover (another company) , only to find that the hard shell would not allow my finger to control the screen.  I searched Amazon, found this cover. I watched the video that LK provided, and the installation was so very simply and easy.  I let the watch dry over night, and awoke to a perfect application.  I now have 5 more screen protectors that came in the box, for future use.  Will the cover allow my finger to complete the commands on the watch face?  As of the first day, it has, with only a couple of repeat swipes of my finger.  To this date, I'm very happy with this product.  Very impressed with the quality, the easy instructions and application. The price for 6 covers is a very good value.  I would recommend this product if you are a person who cares about the screen of your Apple Watch.  *note; I did not rate durability as I haven't used the product long enough to rate it.",

At first I slid it into the middle of the vent but the weight made the vent close and the mount point downwards, so I moved it to the very bottom vent slat and it worked great.<br /><br />I put the magnetic piece between my phone and the phone case - the case is a fairly thick rubber, so I didn't think it would stay in place. When I tested it the phone actually did stay on, but it would fall off if you really shook it. But for driving it's perfect.

They send a round, flat metal plate for the back of the phone with strong adhesive on one side. This item is well designed since it doesn't stick out in your pocket when you decide to carry it. it will stick to the back of just about any type of phone casing. There is also another rectangular metal plate with no adhesive on it. I've never had to use this but i guess its built for a larger phone and tablet so that it can be inserted between the phone and its case. I think this item also needs to have an adhesive on one side or it isn't very useful really.<br />I've compared a lot of different magnetic phone mounts and this beats other similar items out there, simply because it does the exact same thing as others, if not better and for a better price.",

Any bubbles that formed were pushed away with just my thumbs, which by the way worked better than the slider. After having aligned and installed the protector perfectly, i noticed that the width on one side is about 1/2 mm short. It is not a problem at all, but i notice it when i turn the phone off and lay it down. They do sell an edge to edge protector it seems. However, that is twice the price, and i'd recommend this one over any. The reason being simple.<br />If you think about it, most of us probably trade phones in about a year or two, which isn't a long time. The screen will still stay in a pretty great shape with this on and you'll probably add a case to the phone anyway. Therefore, in my opinion this is a more reasonable purchase. Some of the more cheaper ones can be a hit or miss. If it is a ballistic glass protector with great clarity you want, this is the one i'd recommend.",

It is faux carbon fiber and the sides are not metal, but this is perfect for me because during warm or especially cold months here, real metal would have retained all the heat/ cold which can be really unpleasant to the touch. It would also have transferred the heat to the phone itself. For once going cheaper actually was a better decision. Also for its level of design and its perfect architecture/ fit at this price, it gets my vote as one of the best cases out there.<br />Only thing i would like to point out is that the white backside can pick up stains over time giving it a slight discoloration. It is soft to touch like rubber, so hopefully it stays just as beautiful as it came for a while. I am thinking of applying some protective coating on the back so that it repels dirt. That is maybe something the manufacturers can take into consideration in the future.",

It looks just the way you would expect a brand new phone to look. The heatsink pads on the front assembly also have little plastic films on them so they are fresh right when you drop the motherboard down onto it.<br /><br />Installation of this product took an hour or so with the help of a video. I'm used to assembling PCs and doing laptop repairs but this was my first phone repair. Reassembly was simple enough and /most/ of the disassembly was straightforward, but there are a couple things you might want to consider when you take apart the phone.<br /><br />While I was able to take all of the components out and reinstall them in the new display assembly in working order, it seems very easy to accidentally mangle the flexible USB PCB when prying it off of the adhesive on the assembly because it was really rough (a couple people suggested using a hairdrier(?) to loosen the adhesive). The adhesive must also be reused because the display assembly does not come with new adhesive which came off alright for me but it seemed really easy to mess up (you may want to take a picture of the adhesive positioning before peeling it off the assembly). The power button and vibrating motor device was also easy to mangle and it was definitely a challenge with the tools I had.<br /><br />Tools required IMO: hemostats or small needle nose pliers, a metal spudger, a precise narrow plastic spudger, and something flat and plastic to pry up with (my plastic spudger worked)<br /><br />I really recommend making sure you have a good tool for each part of the disassembly, so make sure you watch a video on it and not just a teardown so that you know what you're getting into and order what you need.",

    "text": "I the end, I gave 5 stars because of good customer service. I initially had trouble finding a case that I liked and that seemed worth the money for my new S21 5G. There just weren't a lot of choices. Then I saw this one. I like this color - not too flashy, but something different besides plain black or white. The price was pretty good, so I figured it was no huge loss if I changed to another later.<br />It was a bit difficult to put on. Like many more durable cases, it has the inner hard plastic shell and a second outer layer that is softer and more grippable. The inner hard plastic shell broke at the top when I was trying to put it on. I still managed to put it on and the outer shell held it all together pretty well despite the break. I was still a little annoyed, so I messaged the company telling them that it broke while I was trying to put it on - and they promptly sent me a brand new one, no return required, no hassle at all.<br />All in all, pretty pleased. I would say to be careful when putting the case on. But once it's on, it feels quite sturdy. It has the \"lip\" to keep your screen from smashing into the ground if you drop it, too. My popsocket sticks to it fine. All the button markers and holes are in the right place. And the customer service is top notch. It's not an expensive case like otterbox, but the feel of the case reminds me of otterbox cases I had on previous phones. I was rather surprised at how sturdy it felt once on my phone, especially given the price.<br />So.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Cheap price<br />* Looks good<br />* Feels very sturdy with the inner and outer layers<br />* \"Lip\" to keep screen from getting smashed if you drop your phone on a flat surface<br />* Great customer service if you have a problem<br /><br />Cons:<br />* A little bit of a struggle to get on for me<br />* The hard plastic inner shell will snap at a thin part if not careful when applying force, but the company seems to replace for free with no hassle if this happens.",

I won't be making that expensive mistake again! Now I clean it out regularly with canned air, but it's a chore and annoying to have to do so frequently.....enter these dust filters. They won't catch fine particles (if it was any more tightly woven to catch them, airflow would be an issue), but it catches bigger particles and dog hair/cat hair like a champ so far. If you have pets with lots of hair, these are a MUST!<br /><br />Super easy to install. There's no instructions but I'd hope you'd not need any. Literally just screw them in. It includes screws but I didn't need them - just used the ones that are used to hold my fans in already. Easy peasy. Installed in about a minute.<br /><br />Super happy with my purchase. It will reduce how often I have to give my computer a good spray down.",

Just don't play hockey with it and you'll be good.<br />I have only used it a handful of times, but so far, so good.<br />I took it with me when I went camping for the weekend and would not have access to outlets besides car chargers - it worked beautifully to charge my smartphone, and pretty quickly. I did not recharge the power bank. 4 months later, it was still sitting there in my room. Then the power went out after a tree fell on a line - and it stayed out. My phone was about to die. But I need my internet! I whipped out the power bank, thinking it would be dead by now, or at least very little charge from having charged my phone twice while camping. Nope! It charged it full again and still indicated it had some power left in it.<br />The case is mostly plastic, but seems solid enough. You shouldn't be stomping on your power bank, anyway. Frankly, for the price, I'm pretty pleased. It has held up well. I actually DID step on my messenger bag one - which the bank was in - stepped right on the bank in the bag.

    "title": "Protector is solid strong, However…",
    "text": "This protector case is pretty solid and it seems it would definitely protect the Apple Watch Ultra. It's thick and durable. What I do not like is that the touch screen protector that is part of it makes it difficult to touch the buttons.  For example: Passcode. You have to press down really hard and hold it down so the numbers will take. If you don't hold it down, the number pressed will disappear.  It's very annoying.<br /><br />Installation<br /><br />I followed the directions but it's not that simple.  It states to insert crown side first and not to press down using the screen protector, to use the sides of it. That didn't work for me. I continued to insert crown side first and slowly try to align the left side of the watch. It doesn't go on easily.  I had to use the tip of my finger and carefully lift the left side of protector away from watch and use my other hand to press down. That popped on really fast.  It scared me with the actual screen. No damage, thank god.<br /><br />In summary, the protector is very strong and durable. I do not like the difficulty of trying to press buttons.  I gave it 4 stars for durability, but that screen protector needs some improvements.",

My pinky is finally healing up. Taking time, but getting there.<br /><br />The adhesive is strong.  They do provide an extra one in case you need it. I haven't had to use my extra 3m disc.  Just be sure to do what most people would do for screen protectors: wipe the area down with an alcohol wipe to get rid of dirt or oils from fingers. This helped me with a strong placement. I hope this company never goes out of business.  This is a must-have necessity for holding cell phones while texting/typing!!!<br /><br />Highly recommend!!",

When you try to lift the silicone to put your finger(s) through, it pops off.  There are much better magnetic phone grips/rings out there, like the Anker magnetic ring, which is relatively strong and I love them! Yes, them. I bought one for my Apple phone and another for my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. Anyways, I suggest not wasting your money on this thing. If your looking for a  magnetic ring-type, which is great as a phone stand, go for Anker!",

    "title": "Definitely Charges Phones",
    "text": "I use to use the portable Anker battery chargers to charge my phones. Now that wireless charging is popular, this device does a good job connecting, and staying connected, to wirelessly charge the phones. The magnet is strong. It charges the phone fast. And I love it's a square little thing to carry around vs using a large portable charger.<br /><br />I used this mostly on my iPhone with Magsafe case until I finally decided to switch to the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (yea, never thought I would leave Apple world). When it charged my iPhone, it was fast and didn't get warm at all. On my Samsung Galaxy (not very many true Magsafe cases yet), I purchased a case here on Amazon that has the magnets built into the cases. Side note: being that the Galaxy S22 series is relatively new, I am hoping better, true MagSafe cases will surface. I pray manufacturers who make the same Apple cases will also make them for Android that has the wireless charging capability.  Anyways, I used this charger with a case that has the magnets built into it. After about 15-20 mins, the phone case is very warm. I didn't like that, so I avoid using this device on my Galaxy (I kept my Apple phone due to Dexcom G6 and Insulin pump. Why I changed makers? Wanted something different.). I could try to charge without the case, and I probably should now that I think about it, and will at another time (will update later), but it is a pain in the butt to keep taking the phone out of the case.  I bought 2 different magnetic cases and stuck with the one I have now, I noticed that switching was causing my phone screen (Invishield Fusion) to start lifting around the edges. And we all know that brand is expensive!! I had to replace it - thank goodness for warranty!<br /><br />So in a nutshell, it works great with true MagSafe cases, but the cheap ones on the market right now do cause the phone to heat up. Fingers crossed that true MagSafe cases will be developed for non Apple phones!<br /><br />I do highly recommend this wireless battery charger.  It charges the phone fast, and also charges up just as fast too. You may be able to get a few phone charges out of it before having to give it some juice.<br /><br />Definitely a go for Apple MagSafe cases, but caution with other wireless charging cases. I hope this kinda helps. I will need to test this charger without a case at a later time. I know this doesn't help at the moment, but I do love this charging gadget.",

However, it ended up cracking all over the place and it's been a few weeks or so since I have put it on. I ended up buying from another protector from a different company who also has rave reviews.  The clarity is on par with this screen protector, but hasn't cracked yet.  Pulling this screen protector off was very tough.  I ended up using a kitchen scrapper to get underneath the protector to lift it off.  It was so bad that It broke  off into pieces.  The adhesion is great, but very short life span, and I never handle my iPhone badly. In fact, in all the years I have owned iPhones and purchased screen protectors, never in my life have I ever encounter this.  I do NOT recommend this product.<br /><br />Like many people, I have used different brands of screen protectors and this one is a huge winner!! I decided to replace my InvisiShield that was lifting.  I was looking for a protector that has great clarity.  The reviews were high on this and I took a chance!!<br /><br />Not only is this shield extremely clear and the display is remarkable, but it's easy to clean.  And installation was a breeze!!!  I highly recommend this product!!!",

    "text": "There is not much of a selection out there when it comes to protecting the screen on the Fitbit Sense.  The packaging, thorough directions, and ratings were what determined to give these screen protectors a try.  They are nothing like Zagg, unfortunately, and the material/screen protector wasnt that great. That whole thing about you get what you pay for, is true.<br /><br />Now, I love how the company provided a step-by-step video on how to apply the screen onto the device. They even talk you through regarding the bubbles under the screen protector and timeframes for it to cure.  I have to appreciate that as they went above and beyond for their customers by explaining everything in detail.<br /><br />I followed the directions for the application to the T.  Everything they mentioned happened (bubbles, dry time, etc.).  I went through two screen protectors, though.  The first one was easy to install. Did exactly what the company said about allowing it too dry if it was too wet and/or slippery.  It took about 15 mins to finally start sticking to the screen.  Once that happened, I used the little squeegee they provided to press out the bubbles.  But somewhere, somehow there were two scratches on the outer screen. I was shocked.  The screen protector looked horrible when the sun or lights hit it. My guess is that maybe I was using the squeegee a little too hard?  But I will say this: the  screen protector is a bit dense and squishy. And being wet probably did not help as well. In any case, I decided to re-do it and did not like how it felt once dried. I took it off.<br /><br />I gave the company 3 stars because they did everything right. Packaging looked great, QR code for their video tutorial, which was dead on when applying the screen protectors, and warranty (though I did not attempt). I have decided to try another brand to see how its looks and feels. If that does not work, and we are talking about limited screen protectors for Fitbit Sense watch, then I may come back to this brand out of desperation.  I know there are bumpers/covers that protect the Fitbit screen - I tried that, too. But it covers the sensors needed if you want to see an ECG.<br /><br />I will have to update this review very soon just to share the final outcome.<br /><br />I hope this review helps a little bit.",
