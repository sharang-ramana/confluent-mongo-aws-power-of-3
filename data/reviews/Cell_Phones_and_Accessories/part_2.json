Able to see in bright sunlight environment.<br /><br />A bit longer than any phone I've ever had and that seems to make it fit better in my hands.<br /><br />Front camera is a single 19 MP, f/2.0, 25mm camera. I've had great results in all lighting conditions with the front camera. More contrast and HDR look to images than other phones I've used. Great for 4K video as well. Selfie camera is single 13 MP, f/1.9, 23mm camera. Works well in most lighting conditions.<br /><br />Finger print scanner on the back works fast and is in a good location for my hands. Also come with multi touch screen.<br /><br />Build quality is excellent. Feels like quality in your hand.<br /><br />Comes with lastedAndroid OS Pie<br /><br />Speakers are the best I've heard on any mobile device. Even ones 10 times the size. Also has the vibration sound assist which is a brilliant idea and makes the sound that much better.<br /><br />Comes with non-removable Li-Ion 3300 mAh battery that lasts for a long time. Easily last me the day with light to moderate use.<br /><br />Cons<br />No audio jack. A trend among all manufacturers these day.<br /><br />I think portrait mode suffers from not having 2 front cameras. Portraits I have seen on other flagship phones are better.<br /><br />Side sense is annoying but easy to turn off.",

    "text": "This red unit arrived broken. Amazon dispatched a replacement, received today. While this replacement product is not broken, the color is O-R-A-N-G-E, not red.<br /><br />Now I ordered two of these cases, one navy, one red. If you compare the two, they are MADE DIFFERENTLY at the bottom end. The navy case has a cover at the point of the USB cord slot, the orange one is open, no cover.  The navy case has an opening at the holes where you speak into the phone. The orange case has holes but they are ABOVE the phone speaker.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed in this situation. It is as if these cases were rushed into production without regard for the customer. This is one of very few AWFUL purchases I have made through Amazon over many many years.<br /><br />Fortunately I did buy a pair of Spigen cases to tide us over until the real deal comes along.",

I cannot explain why, but I'll  take it! More often than not, the Device Care app will show a one day, five hour life to be expected.  The case does not have military-grade rating like my Spigen.

I have used such cases before and hv always found them to be the best<br />2. I note that the upper and lower edge slope upward, creating more distance between the phone and any surface.<br />Not one of my cases protects the sides of the phone - it is simply a matter of the way S10s are made. DON'T  expect any case to cover those sides.<br />3. There are two covers at the bottom of the case for the USB cord and headphones. When you put the case on, OPEN those covers first and the phone will pop right into the case. Keep the two sections together when you do this step.<br />I have dropped my phone a few times with one of my other cases on at the time. They have all orotected my phone.

Some observations:<br />1. Our phones do not get hot while charging - s10 Galaxy phones<br />2. We have Spigen cases - no interference with charging<br />3. The charge time is in fact the same or a bit less than wired<br />4. The phone shows that it has reached 100% when it gets there. It would be nice if a light stayed on to let you know the cookies have been baked<br />5. The charger \"found\" our wifi service on plug in - nothing to enter or do<br />6.

Using this phone is just like using a Windows OS computer -- your e-mail, photos, and favorite websites are all just a tap away.<br /><br />I am told by people I call that the phone sound clarity is very adequate (I am understating the case -- I was told it is \"perfect\" including over the SYNC system in our SUV). We were able to port our phone numbers from our old carrier -- just be sure AT&T has your correct information from your former carrier account. We did have a glitch, but AT&T quickly fixed things. AT&T also solved other problems in a way that was very beneficial to us. I cannot speak too highly of both their tech support and billing employees. They have been superb!<br /><br />Bear in mind that if you are used to smaller flip phones, for example, the size of this baby takes a little getting used to; however, this slight impracticality is outweighed by all of the things this phone can do.<br /><br />There are apps for everything under the sun, and many, many are free. We are using GasBuddy, WeatherBug, FastFood Nutrition, and Lotto, to name a few.<br /><br />Our data package with AT&T gives each of us 3Gig of data per month. We are averaging under 10Meg a day, so we are well on course. When we use a WiFi network, we get unlimited data use and no usage charge against the 3Gig allotment. We may be able to cut back to a 300Meg plan and save on the monthly charges. (If any of this turns out differently over time, I will update this section of my review.)<br /><br />If you are looking to take the next step in hardware, I am confident that you will be very happy with this choice. The AT&T-Nokia-Microsoft relationship is a good one for us customers!",

Calls drop and often I can't make calls because I am out of range, whatever that means - never happened with cheaper phones! The only way out of that is to turn it off and on again. I've had to contact my cell phone company three times now to reset the phone, which involves me removing the sim card, and turning it off while they do that from their end. When I asked how to avoid doing this, they said buy a new phone. How disappointing!!! I would not recommend this phone for that reason, for not making calls (see above), for not being loud enough for voicemails, for saying that my contacts to call do not exist when they do, for calls not going through -they dial and hang up. It's SO frustrating. I didn't get insurance, so, I am screwed and need to keep the phone, but it's sooo frustrating! Would not recommend.",

However I just bought a better screen protector and I love the set up. Of course I'm not one that is super hard on my phone but at least I know if I drop it by accident I have a good chance of surviving the fall. I do recommend this case. Don't let the price fool you.

However I am satisfied with what I got.<br /><br />The materials feel cheap and i can't speak towards the durability since I just started using it. But the buttons are very clicky and control sticks feel very smooth. They have little resistance though. The rear triggers are too soft, but I'm not going to use them much. I just wanted something to play old school games on emulators.<br /><br />The only real downside is that my controller came with one dead button (select) that doesn't work at all. Since the games I'm trying to play require way less buttons, it's a not a big deal (I can remap to an extra button), but that's still not good.<br /><br />Also this controller is on the small size. I have tiny hands so I actually like this, but for average or large hands, this might cause you to cramp up.<br /><br />One other detail, is that the buttons are labeled (a, b, x, y , etc) but the way a PC or phone reads that does not match. They're all reversed so it can be confusing if you have no way to remap buttons)<br /><br />Pros:<br />- clicky buttons (except for triggers)<br />- connected easily to phone and PC<br />- tiny controller (I have small hands)<br />- dpad feels responsive<br />- good price compared to rivals ($16)<br />- good size holder (even my friend's new note 9 fits!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- came with dead button (select)<br />- button labels don't match mapping on devices<br />- tiny controller (if you have average or large hands)<br />- cheap feeling materials<br />- bad trigger button feel<br />- little resistance on control sticks<br /><br />Takings stars off for dead button.

Each corner is slightly bulky, meaning that even if you drop the phone on the front or back, it will always hit the case first, unlike some thinner cases I've seen would are flush with the screen.<br /><br />I got mine in a cool semi-transparent gradient blue to purple, and the back of the cover is clear, really showing off the nice lilac color of my S9. It has all the appropriate holes for speakers, camera, headphones, fingerprint etc. It also doesn't interfere with my clear skin protector. The button spaces are all responsive, and it's a snug fit that won't come off easily.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with what I got. It was exactly what I wanted, and for a decent price.",

Only one negative—it's hard to take screenshots as there is too much of the wallet close to the upper right iPhone power button, which is needed to take screenshots. Maybe they can fix it. Still a great product and a great buy. I've had phone wallets for many years. This is by far the best. Would by again. Highly recommend!",

For it to work, the FOB must be placed inside the zippered compartment (not just the gold-lined pocket).<br /><br />RFID blocking will block signals from credit cards that broadcast wireless signals, and signals from most cell phones. A functioning Faraday bag will also block signals from car key FOBs.  In my experience, Faraday bags stop working after a few months, so you must retest the FOB blocking regularly, if blocking your car's key FOB signal is important to you.  (If the bag should stop working, wrap your car key FOB completely in a couple of layers of aluminum foil to block the signal.)<br /><br />This Faraday bag is big enough to hold a Samsung Galaxy S10 phone, with plenty of room to spare.  If you store your cell phone in the bag, you should power it off or turn on Airplane mode.  That way your phone won't keep seeking a cell tower signal, and won't run your battery down.<br /><br />.",

I'm unwilling to plug in a device that has a voltmeter, when the function of the voltmeter is NOT explained in the accompanying literature.<br /><br />I'm also turned off by the array of power on/off switches for the adapter and the individual sockets.  Presumably the device won't drain my car battery if they're all turned off, but who knows?  (Again, there's nothing about car battery drainage in the instructions.)<br /><br />Even if the switches turn everything off that's able to drain the battery, there's no way that I won't forget and leave one or more turned on some time when I turn off the car's ignition.  For me to use a device like this, I need for the device to turn off automatically with the ignition.<br /><br />In the end, I don't really need a bunch of extra accessory power sockets in my car.  My car has two sockets, and will also charge a cellphone that is plugged into a built-in USB charging port.  I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this device.",

My Samsung Galaxy S10 phone recognizes it as a “fast charger” when it is plugged into my Honda Accord's accessory power socket, and it seems to charge the phone quite fast.<br /><br />Both cables work.  Both cables have USB Type C plugs--the reversible oval kind that are used by newer Galaxy phones.  The blue light around the rim of the charger tells you it is connected.  The light also makes it easier to see the ports on the plugged-in charger, if your car's accessory power socket is in a dark space like the Accord's pocket or console.<br /><br />Note that this is a “Cluvox” car charger, not a “name brand” car charger, so the quality may not be as good as you might get from a more expensive charger purchased from a cell phone manufacturer or seller (e.g., Samsung, Verizon).  I haven't had my Cluvox charger for long enough to know whether it will continue to work well.",

    "text": "This ESR USB-C 18W FAST WALL CHARGER WITH PD (UL Certified, with Foldable Prong) charges my new iPad Air (3rd Gen) very fast--much, much faster than the Apple 12W USB Charger that came with it.<br /><br />PD means “Power Delivery”.  USB PD is a new power standard that can be used across multiple devices, so that you don't need a lot of different adapters.  PD increases power levels--up to 100W--so that devices charge faster.  PD determines how much power each device needs, and ensures that each device is NOT overcharged.  This ESR USB charger delivers 18W of power.<br /><br />PD chargers have USB-C ports, so you will need a cable with a USB-C plug (rather than the familiar flat USB plug) to connect your iPad, cellphone, etc.  My iPad uses a lightning cable, so I ordered this [[ASIN:B07CMN7DCX Apple Lightning to USB-C cable]].  It's a genuine Apple cable that arrives new in a sealed Apple box, so I know it's safe to use with the iPad.<br /><br />Until I got the settings on the new iPad adjusted to eliminate battery-draining default features, I was actually having to curtail my iPad use.  The iPad was discharging rapidly, and the recharging with the ordinary USB adapter was taking forever.  This 18W PD adapter solved the problem completely.  The iPad recharges quickly even when it's connected to my home wireless network and I'm using it.",

    "text": "UPDATE 7/14/18:  Star rating downgraded from 4 stars to 1 star.  The wIreless charging pad is too flaky to rely upon.  After a week of use, my phone became reluctant to recognize the pad--or vice versa--and I had to reposition the phone, wiggle the cable, or plug and unplug the cable to get wireless charging to work at all.  The problem is with the charging pad, because the cable and &#34;cigarette lighter&#34; plug will charge my phone fast if the cable is plugged directly into the phone.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  The vent clip clamps on this VENTEX WIRELESSPRO DOCK are almost too thick to fit into the widest vent openings (on the far left and right) in my 2003 Honda Civic.  The vent clip itself is very stiff to open, and barely opens wide enough to fit around the vent slats.  Once installed, the vent clip holds tightly and securely.<br /><br />The phone holder easily accepts my Samsung Galaxy S7+ (inside an Otterbox Symmetry case).  It's nice to have a wireless charger on the dashboard, so that I don't have to keep two phone cables in the car (one for a phone with a Micro AB port, and one for a phone with a Type C port).<br /><br />The wireless charger seems to work fine.  My Galaxy phone indicated right away that it was charging.  With a lock screen active display on, the charger added about 13% to the charge level during a 15-minute auto trip.<br /><br />With the power-draining Google Maps navigation display (with sound) turned on, the charger just barely maintained the existing charge level.  My phone was also quite hot afterwards--not uncommon with qi charging when a network connection is active, or with Google Maps live navigation generally--so in the future I'll probably use the charging only when I'm NOT using Google Maps live navigation or am using it only briefly.<br /><br />The plug fits rather tightly into the DC power (“cigarette lighter”) receptacle on my Honda, but that's okay. The cable is long enough to easily reach from the left side air vent to the receptacle, which is below the radio in the middle of the dashboard.",

    "title": "Rugged Unlocked Smartphone for GSM Cellular Networks",
    "text": "This CAT S31 RUGGED WATERPROOF SMARTPHONE (Unlocked) is my first unlocked phone, and I really didn't know what to expect.  What I discovered is that there are two types of phones:  (1) phones intended for GSM networks (AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket, and other carriers), and (2) phones intended for CDMA networks (mainly Verizon and Sprint).<br /><br />If you try to sign this GSM phone up for a cellular plan at Verizon or Sprint—using the “Bring Your Own Phone” option—you are asked to check the phone's compatibility by entering the 15-digit IMEI number (conveniently printed on the outside of the CAT S31 box).  Both networks return “incompatible”, so you will need to Google GSM to find compatible networks.  (You can't add this incompatible phone to an existing Sprint or Verizon plan, either.)<br /><br />Cricket responded “compatible” and offered to sell me a SIM card and plan; ATT said “compatible, but can't locate a suitable SIM card”, so I stopped there and went with Cricket.  There seem to be quite a few GSM networks around, though.<br /><br />By law, the phone will make emergency calls without a SIM card connection to a cellular network.<br /><br />While waiting for a SIM card and cellular connection, I can use this phone to connect to the Internet through my home network (powered by Comcast Xfinity).  Once connected to the network, my phone syncs automatically with my Google account.  The phone is generally quite easy to set up—especially if you're already familiar with the Android interface and navigation.<br /><br />This is an extremely rugged phone, as advertised.  It has a thick rubber backing, sloped corners, and thick rubber bumpers on the edges.  There are rubber-stoppered openings in the bumpers for a USB charging cable, SIM card insertion, and Micro SD card insertion.  With the stoppers closed, the phone is highly resistant to dust, damp, and short immersions in water.  Picking up the phone, it feels so sturdy, I feel no need to purchase any additional case or screen protector.  The phone is comfortable to hold.<br /><br />The phone has front- and rear-facing cameras.  The cameras don't match the quality of my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone, but they're perfectly adequate for a heavy-duty outdoor-workplace-use phone.  The navigation isn't as slick as the fancier phone, either, as the phone has physical buttons to push for “home”, “back”, and “recent apps” (instead of icons on the touchscreen).",

This ION WIRELESS PLUS FAST QI CHARGING PAD (7.5W for iOS; 10W for Android; USB-C Cable & Adapter Included; Dual Charge Feature; Ruby) is no exception, but it's NOT perfect.<br /><br />As a fast Qi charger, it seems to charge as fast or faster than my Samsung fast Qi charger (2018 model).  When you place your phone on the iOttie pad, a white light comes on to signal that your phone is charging.<br /><br />A blinking red light is supposed to tell you that something is wrong and the phone is NOT charging, but the feature didn't seem to work with my Galaxy S7 and S9 phones.  I saw the red light only once—when I was deliberately trying to place the phone in the wrong position—and it faded within a second or two. That's okay, because the white light is all that's needed to signal charging.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE:  The iOttie charging pad may turn off inexplicably, shortly after charging has begun, so that your planned extended charging doesn't happen.  You need to check back after a few minutes, or occasionally, to make sure that the white light remains on.  I have experienced the same behavior with other Qi charging pads (including the Samsung pads), and I don't know what the cause is.  However, the behavior doesn't seem to occur if I turn off the phone's wireless, Bluetooth, and network connections before charging.<br /><br />Your phone's charging light will tell you when charging is complete, because the pad does NOT do this.  (Most Qi charging pads only signal that the pad is actively charging.)  In fact, the white light will stay on when charging is at 100%, if your phone is using background apps that are drawing on the battery and causing the pad to continue replenishing the charge.<br /><br />The rubberized iOttie target grips the phone just enough to hold it in the correct charging position (in case your desktop or the pad is bumped).  The pad doesn't heat your phone as much as the Samsung pads sometimes do.<br /><br />The iOttie pad will charge any Qi-enabled phone (not just the newer phones with USB-C charging ports), regardless of whether the phone is capable of fast wireless charging.  The pad requires a USB-C cable to connect to an AC power source, but doesn't require USB-C to connect with and charge a device.  A USB-C cable and AC adapter are included in the box (and iOttie strongly recommends that you use only the supplied accessories).<br /><br />The dual charge feature (using the USB-A port) works, but it seems to charge the second device extremely slowly.  The speed seems about the same whether or not a Qi-enabled phone is being charged at the same time.  (I tested the dual charge feature with an Amazon Fire HD10 7th Gen tablet, which I usually charge with an ordinary USB cable plugged into a USB port on a charging station.)<br /><br />Overall, this is an attractive, small-footprint, easy-to-engage Qi-charging pad that looks great on any desktop.  I love the ruby color and the coarse-textured fabric cover.  Buy it for its good looks, and very fast Qi charging for phones capable of fast wireless charging.",

I think it provides a LOT of protection for the phone—certainly it protects against moderate drops and minor contact with other items in a tote bag or backpack.<br /><br />However, it adds quite a bit of bulk and weight to the fairly large S9 phone, and the belt clip on the black display cover sticks out far enough to make it awkward to pick up or lay down the phone.  The belt clip functions as a kickstand when the phone is in landscape orientation—except that it takes considerable finger strength to snap the clip backwards into a fixed position.  The phone will fit either face up or face down into the black cover, but this extra belt-clip piece is clumsy to handle.<br /><br />The case covers the phone's buttons, which all work fine with the case installed.

The backing makes the case comfortable to hold.  There are holes in the backing that allow you to connect earphones when the phone is inside the case.  The wide Velcro-secured strap makes the case easy to grip.<br /><br />The case does NOT interfere with the touchscreen sensitivity at all. However, the clear plastic window (through which you view the touchscreen) sticks tightly to the screen protector on the phone when you try to remove the phone from the case.  (The case window isn't tacky or covered with adhesive, it's just that the plastic window and plastic screen protector stick to each other like plastic food-covering film.)<br /><br />This makes it difficult to remove the smartphone from the case—in my opinion, a major design flaw.  But for that, this is a well-made, securely stitched case that performs well as a handheld phone case for runners.",

    "title": "Terrific Protective Case for Fairly Weighty Phone",
    "text": "This OTTERBOX DEFENDER SERIES CASE FOR GALAXY S8+ (Screen Protector Not Included; Cowabunga Blue/Gunmetal Grey) is a terrific protective case for a fairly weighty, curved-screen phone.  It consists of a two-piece plastic inner case that cradles the phone, and a rubber slipcover for the inner case that surrounds the phone with a thick bumper.  There is no screen protector (found on many Defender series cases for other phones), because of the S8+'s curved touchscreen.<br /><br />The only negative feature of this protective case is that the rubber slipcover interferes with wireless charging.  However, wireless charging works normally with the slipcover off, and the slipcover is easy to remove and replace.<br /><br />A separate hard plastic piece fits over the display, covering it completely.  This piece has a belt clip that holds the phone firmly.  I like this, as my strong preference is for belt-clip or holster cases.<br /><br />The belt clip can be held open by a small tab, so that the clip functions as a mini stand (for viewing the display in landscape position only).  It's hard to engage the hold-open tab, and the “stand” is not adjustable, so this feature is not a reason to buy the case.<br /><br />The rubber slipcover is grey.  The inner plastic case is an unusual shade of bright blue (almost teal).  The plastic cover piece with the belt clip is black.<br /><br />NOTE:  All protective cases for the curved touchscreens (Galaxy S7 Edge, S8, S8+) leave the curved portion of the display unprotected at the sides (showing slightly above the edge of the case).  This is necessary to provide full functionality for the curved portions of the touchscreen.  If you drop a curved-screen phone face down when the touchscreen is uncovered, you may crack the screen, no matter what case you're using.  When the belt-clip piece of this case is used, the display is fully covered and reasonably well protected.",

    "text": "This beautifully made, sturdy UNIVERSAL DUAL FOLDABLE MULTI ANGLE PHONE/TABLET STAND is the best adjustable stand ever!  It fits both my iPad Air2 and my Galaxy S7 Edge phone, incredible as that may sound.<br /><br />The cradle portion has curved-up tips with gripper lining that holds a large tablet or a small cellphone securely.  The stand portion can be adjusted to virtually any viewing angle or height.  The base portion has gripper backing so it doesn't slide on the surface beneath it.<br /><br />In using this with an iPad, you can adjust the cradle to rest on a table, along with the base, and this creates a really solid stand that doesn't rock or jiggle when you type on it.  The folding joints are quite stiff—it takes some hand pressure to move them—but this is a good thing, because they “remember” their position.  The stand does NOT collapse easily.<br /><br />I love the light charcoal, metallic “Space Gray” color.  I also love the compact size (3-⅝” x 5-½” folded), and small tabletop footprint.",

The back really sparkles, and the “stars” seem to move (as if animated) with only the slightest movement of the phone in your hand.<br /><br />The back of the case is clear plastic with silver flakes; the bumper that surrounds the phone is silvery gray.  This case would be positively gorgeous if the bumper were completely clear.  (Any color at all in the bumper interferes a little with the “unbox your phone” concept of the curved-edge Galaxy S8+.)<br /><br />Because I carry my S8+ in a holster case (see [[ASIN:B00OMODOYO leatherette case]]), an Otterbox Symmetry series case provides adequate protection for short drops and scratches.  The back of the phone is completely covered, and the rubber bumper is built up at the top and bottom so that the phone can be laid face down with care.<br /><br />The Symmetry case doesn't add much bulk, or extra weight.  It is easily removed from the phone (which is necessary if you want to use the Galaxy S8+ phone's oddly shaped, wide-shouldered Type C USB to USB cable adapter for transferring files by cable).

It provides the same vertical coverage as the temporary protective film that comes on the S8+ cellphone as shipped, with more complete horizontal coverage.  It goes all the way to the side edges.  The wet installation--something that I usually hate--is safe for the phone, and results in excellent, lasting adhesion over the curved sides of the display.<br /><br />You can remove the plastic film even after it has been drying for a few hours.  My film trapped one prominent speck of dust that I couldn't ignore, so I pulled up about one-fourth of the film, re-sprayed the lifted portion to release the dust mote, and smoothed the film down again.  The film is now looking as if it was never repositioned.<br /><br />Once applied, the plastic film is crystal clear.  It doesn't affect the screen sensitivity in the slightest.  Tiny bubbles left over from the installation disappear in a few days.<br /><br />The clear, photo-illustrated steps for installation need to be followed carefully, but installation isn't difficult.  Note that this is NOT &#34;a simple stick-on film&#34;, as some reviewers have remarked.  One side of the film is tacky, but this &#34;sticky&#34; side must be moistened with wetting solution, or it will not adhere to the screen surface.<br /><br />You receive only one piece of protective film, but you also get everything you need to ensure a perfect or near-perfect result.  The box includes film, a good-sized microfiber cloth, a sticky dust-mote remover, an alcohol swab, a bubble-smoother card, an ample spray bottle of wetting solution, and a clear plastic case to use for 2-3 days while the wetting solution is drying.<br /><br />My Galaxy S8+ looks like a million dollars!",

There are raised “buttons” for the on/off button, the Bixby button, and the volume buttons.<br /><br />The case itself has a silky feel when you hold it in your hand.  The “dual-layer protection” consists of a rigid outer shell and a flexible silicone bumper.  The case is advertised as drop-tested to 12 feet--I didn't personally test this.<br /><br />You'll want to use a screen protector with this case.  The bumper doesn't rise above the side edges--of necessity, because of the curved screen--and it doesn't rise very high above the top and bottom edges.  If you lay your S8+ face down carelessly, it's possible to scratch the screen.<br /><br />This is a nice, serviceable, reasonably priced case.

My S7 Edge phone still slides easily into this GALAXY S7 EDGE VERTICAL LEATHER HOLSTER (sold by Anma Direct), and the case's magnetic-closure flap closes completely with the encased phone inside.  The phone fits snugly into this vertical holster case, but is still easy to pull out when needed.<br /><br />This holster case is made of padded faux leather that feels like really soft, thin leather.  It has a solidly attached belt clip.  It's exactly what I wanted, and it completely lives up to my expectations from the Amazon product description.",

    "title": "Simple \"Half-Case\" Fits Galaxy S7 Edge Perfectly, Provides Drop Protection",
    "text": "This UAG SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE FEATHER-LIGHT COMPOSITE PHONE CASE (ICE) is a very good &quot;half-case&quot; that covers the phone back.  The case is lightweight, fits the S7 Edge perfectly, and provides drop protection.  Since the screen is NOT covered, the phone is ready to use the minute you pick it up.  However, I'm not comfortable with any case that doesn't completely surround the phone--in my heart, I know that if I drop the phone, it will drop screen-side down.<br /><br />I love the fact that the &quot;Ice&quot; color case is made of clear plastic, with black rubber only at the edges.  The clear plastic lets the gold metal of the phone itself show through.  The black rubber parts hold the phone securely, and provide cushioning.  Unfortunately, there are no cutouts on the sides for the volume buttons and on/off button.  Instead, there are black rubber buttons that overlay the buttons on the phone itself.  These work fine, but they don't feel as nice as the &quot;real&quot; buttons.<br /><br />The case is cut down on the sides sufficiently to allow full use of the &quot;edge&quot; feature of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge--the black rubber stops short of the curved glass portion of the phone's screen.  Note that this is neither a holster case nor a stand case--the back merely covers the phone back and holds the surrounding drop-protection bumper in place.  Because of the rubber buttons and the lack of a screen cover, I rate this otherwise excellent case at 4 stars (&quot;I like it&quot; on the official Amazon scale).",

    "title": "Great Design But Too Small for Most Knitting Notions",
    "text": "The PERFECT NOTION CASE has a great design, but it is too small!  The case has two storage compartments, each measuring 3-1/2\" wide by 2\" high by 1/2\" deep.  One compartment is undivided; the other compartment is divided into five smaller compartments.  Each individual storage area has a separate lid.  The product photo illustrates this quite clearly.<br /><br />The largest compartment isn't deep enough to hold a flat lip balm container or a spring-powered rollup tape measure, and it isn't long enough to hold a cable needle or a pair of embroidery scissors.  The only knitting notions I have that will fit in any of the compartments are point protectors, plain stitch markers, T-pins (for blocking), very small [[ASIN:B000QHD65S Boye stitch holders-1-3/4\"]], and my beloved [[ASIN:B0019KAEEC Clover Lock Ring Markers]].<br /><br />The lids on the compartments snap firmly into place, and the outer case is firmly secured with a gate-type latch.  If this case were larger (perhaps 6\" x 4\" x 1\"), it would be a wonderful case.  But as it is, the case is far too small to be of much practical use.  I purchased two of these cases sight unseen from my usual knitting goods supplier, and regret the purchase. I rate the PERFECT NOTION CASE at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the Amazon scale).",

    "title": "Fancy Adaptor Converts AC Outlet to USB Outlet",
    "text": "This RCA USB Charger with Night Glow is a fancy adaptor that converts any standard North American AC outlet to a standard USB outlet for charging battery-powered devices.  You supply the connector cord with USB plug that is appropriate for your device.  The charger works fine when plugged into a surge protector/battery backup AC outlet.<br /><br />What's fancy about this charger is the blue night light, and the orange full charge indicator.  When the charger is plugged in, the blue ring lights up from behind in three places, which provides a pleasant blue glow.  When your device is charging, a gray ring around the black central area lights up in orange.  The orange light turns off when your device is fully charged.  The charger comes with a large cap that snaps on over the back to cover the AC plug and create a neat cylindrical package for travelling.<br /><br />This little adaptor charged my iPod Touch--starting from an empty battery--in about 65 minutes. I like the charger, but was disappointed to learn that it isn't really a traveler's bedside  night light.  That is, instead of resting flat on a bedside table or desktop, it must be plugged directly into an AC outlet, which is usually a wall outlet.  It also doesn't provide much room illumination.  For this reason, I rate it at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the Amazon scale).",

    "title": "A Slim, Elegant Stylus, But Less Responsive Than Other Styluses",
    "text": "Capacitive styluses are not all alike.  Besides color, there are subtle differences in sensitivity, length, barrel size, weight, and attachment clips or lanyards.  This BoxWave stylus, which is 4-7/8\" long (exclusive of the capacitive tip) is disappointing, because it doesn't perform nearly as well as the excellent, shorter [[ASIN:B0008G3ID2 BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus]].<br /><br />Compared to other styluses that I tested, this BoxWave stylus is the longest, has the slimmest barrel, and is lightest in weight.  I loved its elegant, slender appearance, but found that holding such a thin barrel made my hand ache after a while.  Also, the slimmer barrel, and the correspondingly smaller capacitive tip, may explain why this stylus isn't as sensitive or responsive as other  styluses.  Frequently I had to tap the touchscreen more than once, or press down harder on the touchscreen to get a response.  The small tip is good for accuracy in selecting small targets (e.g., links displayed in web browsers in tiny fonts), but accuracy doesn't matter if a light touch won't register.  The extra length is a plus, if you hold a stylus like a pointer (away from the tip), rather than like a pencil (close to the tip).<br /><br />For attaching to other things, this stylus has a pocket clip, a lanyard with a plastic end that can be plugged into an earphones outlet, and a great lobster-claw (necklace-type) fastener with jump ring that opens to detach the lanyard.  Besides this stylus, I tested the [[ASIN:B005O2URES MiniSuit Universal Capacitive Stylus Pen]], the [[ASIN:B0008G3ID2 BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus]], the [[ASIN:B004JU1MNG Targus Stylus for Apple iPad]], and the [[ASIN:B004GCJEZU AmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices]].  My favorite is the AmazonBasics Stylus, because of its 4-1/4\" length, slim barrel, light weight, and excellent sensitivity; the shorter BoxWave stylus is a close second.  I rate this stylus at 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars (\"I like it\"),  because it is so attractive.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, as I was, what a \"capacitive\" stylus is, it is a human interface device (e.g., a mouse) that uses \"capacitive sensing\" to measure changes of position on a touchscreen.  It works just like a human finger on a touchscreen device, and you can often get more accurate navigation using a stylus.  Wikipedia has good articles on capacitive sensing and capacitive devices.",

The instructions for installing it onto your Switch Lite are a little confusing; I muttered a few curse words to myself before my daughter finally figured it out. But once you \"get\" it, there's no problem taking it on/off for ultimate portability. It does add some heft to your console, but it's not too awkward. It does charge quickly and keeps a good long charge on the console when in use. I'm glad I got this!",

The screen cover took some getting used to, but I found it very responsive and hardly noticed it after a while. I am _not_ a fan of port covers on cases, so simply took some scissors and cut the covers off at the joint (you couldn't even tell they had been there). I will say that getting the case on/off requires some patience - I was sure I was going to break the case or the latches at some point. And I don't use the included holster at all. Finally, while the mint & polka dot design is really cute, after a while (3 months?) all the edges showed dirt & grime. With it being a rubbery material, I haven't found a good way to get that clean and looking new again. Overall, a great case for usability and superior protection.",

This makes it easy to slip into your pocket or purse, but not so easy to hang on to during use or to set on the car dash when you need it to stay put (I prefer the somewhat &#34;rubbery&#34; case material for that). It also picks up every fingerprint, smear, or smudge, and I found the external buttons needed to be pushed quite hard to engage. I trust Otterbox as a brand, and if you don't mind 1-piece, slick cases this might be right for you. Just wasn't what I ultimately prefer for my phone.",

The Incipio Performance Series adds the perfect amount of width &amp; weight, but without being bulky. I love the 2-part design, with the flexible interior and the hard outer shell. And it fits my phone like a glove! Though I have not intentionally tested the drop protection, I can say for sure the outer shell is scratch resistant (very impressive). One tiny detraction for me is that the integrated buttons need to be pushed quite specifically to engage. The charging cord fits just fine around the case, though, and I like that the case doesn't seem to pick up dust, hair, debris, or fingerprints. It's a sleek and sturdy case, with the added bonus of a low-profile logo (so you don't feel like you're a walking advertisement for the company). I would highly recommend this for iPhone 7 users!",

Additionally, it has a little stand on the back that you can use to prop up the battery (and thus, prop up your phone). My experience has only been with iPhones and Apple Watches.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is that the wireless charging with iPhones is very slow (5w if I had to guess); much slower than the Apple MagSafe charger. Fortunately, if you have an iPhone, you can plug in a USB-C to lightning cable to get 18w charging.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the battery is that it can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch (I have a Series 6). I'm not exactly sure of the AW charging speed, but it feels like it is the same speed as the non-fast charging Apple Watch charger.<br /><br />This thing is great, and I'd definitely recommend it.",

My problem before was that the tripod would shake any time there was any movement on my desk (like writing or typing). That said, this gooseneck mount solves all of those problems.<br /><br />The gooseneck is very firm and requires a little bit of strength to get into the right position. Fortunately, once you have it where you want it, it does not move. The phone clip is large enough to hold any cell phone and the table clip can fit on a table up to 2.5\" or so (maybe a little larger).<br /><br />The non-gooseneck parts of the mount are plastic. The gooseneck has a braided (if you can call it that) covering over it, but I would imagine it is some sort of metal underneath, based on how firm it is. It does not move at all once it's in position.<br /><br />If you are looking for a sturdy phone mount that is much more flexible than a tripod, I would definitely recommend this.",

There are also elevated plastic buttons on the side for the power and volume buttons. There's a cutout to reach the silent/ring switch. It also has Magsafe, and the magnet in the case appears to be pretty strong (maybe even a little stronger than the phone magnet without a case)<br /><br />The most noticeable difference between this and the Apple leather case is the softness of the leather. The Apple cases are quite soft, whereas this is significantly harder. I'm not a leather expert, but that might be due to the construction, as this has a \"cracked\" leather appearance (see pics), and the Apple cases are clean/not cracked.<br /><br />Another thing that I would change is the location of the brand name around the camera. I would definitely have preferred the brand name was stamped into the leather/elsewhere vs. being written twice around the camera.<br /><br />In my experience, the Apple leather cases will last around a year (which isn't great), or maybe a little less, before they really begin to wear (i.e., color coming off, etc.), so TBD how this one stacks up.<br /><br />Overall a decent case. But for $10 more, I'd probably just go with the Apple one.",

    "text": "There are two telescoping stands in the box. One is white and one is black. The stands unfold and extend and bend into a few angles and heights. Note, however, that the pictures as to its use are highly deceiving on the Amazon site. The site shows a large tablet with one stand and such a scenario is not possible because using one stand for something larger than a phone will cause it to tip over no matter how I change the angle.<br /><br />I actually had to use two stands to hold my fire tablet. However, if I tap the screen, the stands keep wanting to tilt over. In some cases, the base comes a little off the table as I type. The same happens with a phone. Of course, most tablets and phones used on a stand(s) like this will have covers making them heavier than without a cover. It is not realistic not to have a cover for protection and there is no way I will remove the cover to use this.<br /><br />These are also cheaply made. The white stand has a missing rubber piece on the \"front hook clip\" as can be seen in the photos.<br /><br />In summary, this will hold a small iPhone \"lightly\" but not a tablet unless one uses both stands. In addition, the slight force exerted by typing on the phone or tablet can cause the stand to tip over. I personally feel there are better options out there. For instance, I have a [[ASIN:B07HBQSCM3 Boyata Laptop Stand]] that is superb.",

    "text": "At the current price of $11.99 plus 10% off, I think this is a good deal.<br /><br />This works on my LG Notebook, iPad, Google Nexus 7, and Samsung Galaxy Tab. The only one it is a bit touchy on is my LG Notebook as I have to press harder on that screen. On the other three devices all stylus tips are extremely responsive. The only negative is that to get to the pen or the clear tip, one has to unscrew the chamber. Other than this, I love this better than a previous stylus I was using.<br /><br />On the interior of the cylinder is a ballpoint pen and a clear disk tip. On either end of the exterior, is a rubber tip and fiber mesh tip. One replacement tip for each of the four types is provided (see plastic bag in photos 1 & 2). Based on my tests, I do not feel one tip is better over the other. I was able to work with all of them. I personally prefer the rubber or fiber tips over the clear one but none have perfect precision (see last photo). They are just all good enough for what I need this for.<br /><br />In addition to the extra set of tips, it also comes with a fake leather sleeve. Overall, I really like this stylus.",

    "title": "Jabra Freeway is very sleek; VoiceAssist is great!",
    "text": "The Jabra Freeway is very sleek and comes with a free and optional one-year subscription to VoiceAssist.<br /><br />Setting the unit up was easy.<br />1. Before I could use the Jabra Freeway, I charged it for two hours using the supplied USB cable with car charger.<br />2. Next I made sure the cell phone was Bluetooth-enabled and turned on the Jabra unit.<br />3. It immediately went into pairing mode.  As it is pairing with the phone device, the prompts on the phone needed to be followed and the supplied security code had to be entered (not everyone will have to enter a security code; it depends on the phone)<br />4. After this I began making and answering calls using voice commands, checking the battery power of the unit, etc.  To make a call, I had to press the Voice button to wake up the unit and say \"phone commands.\"  If I was unsure of how to speak to the unit I would say \"What can I say?\" and it would give me options.<br /><br />What I found very frustrating was:<br />1. Once I was done with a call, ending the call is not hands free.  I couldn't say \"hang-up, or cancel, or end\" because that doesn't work.  Instead I had to press the \"answer end button\" (which is the \"phone icon\" on the Jabra device) or end the call via the phone end button.<br />2. I also disliked having to press the Voice button every time I wanted to make a call because this meant it was not totally hands free.  The only hands free part is if someone is calling you, the unit then automatically awakes and you can tell it to \"answer\" or \"ignore\" the incoming call.<br />3. Many times I asked the unit to make a call.  Twice it brought up the EZ tip calculator, once it brought up the one-minute beep \"application,\" and another time it brought up some other application on the phone that I didn't ask for.  Another time I tried to call someone and instead it brought up the address book and rambled off both the mobile and work number without giving me the option to dial either one.<br /><br />What I really loved was the optional VoiceAssist package even though I had difficulty getting this set up because the code to redeem the free one-year subscription was hidden underneath a sticker either Amazon or the manufacturer put on the box.  However, VoiceAssist has the best live customer service around.  In fact we called each other almost five times to get this situation resolved in a few hours. Hopefully, new purchasers won't have this experience where the offer code is hidden between stickers and impossible to read even after being held up to the light.<br /><br />Below are the steps I took to get VoiceAssist to work:<br />1. I had to first redeem the free offer code on the box by going to [....].<br />2. Once signed in online to [....],  I imported all my Gmail contacts into the VoiceAssist application and also set up a connection to my review_maven twitter account ([....]).<br />3. Once registered and after I cleaned up the Gmail import which had about an 85% accuracy rate, I then needed to program the number of 949-257-0923 under the name of VoiceAssist into the Bluetooth phone.<br />4. After this I had a lot of fun:<br />  -  I used the Jabra unit to call VoiceAssist.<br />  - Once connected I used another set of VoiceAssist commands to \"call\" people in my contact list (they had to have a phone # in the Gmail contact listed that was imported), to \"post to Twitter,\" to \"read my e-mail\" on Gmail--which it read very well (except it said it couldn't read the pictures), and to send an email, which it sent okay though some of my message was garbled.  However, since an MP3 was attached to the email, the person receiving it could play that to get the full message.<br />  - The two posts to my Twitter account were okay, buy it got VoiceAssist wrong and typed voices instead and it typed Jabra as Java. You can look on the review_maven account to see the posts for May 28. 2011.<br /><br />I didn't have the phone functionality to try the FM Transmitter or play music features of the Jabra device.<br /><br />Below are some of the key features that I liked and some things I disliked:<br /><br /> PROS:<br />1. The Jabra unit is pretty easy to set up<br />2. The Jabra Freeway has a long battery life (about 14 to 17 hours)<br />3. You can pair two Bluetooth phones to the device with the last phone paired being the primary one<br />4. Jabra Freeway comes with a car charger for charging in your vehicle or with a 12Volt Battery Pack; the USB cable that is used to plug in the car adapter can be used without the adapter for charging with your PC<br />5. A free one-year subscription to VoiceAssist is supplied with purchase<br />6. Voice Assist understands commands better than the Jabra unit itself<br />7. I could check and send email and post to Twitter with VoiceAssist (Posting to Facebook is also possible.)<br />8. VoiceAssist provides SUPERB customer service.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. VoiceAssist setup was difficult and the instructions that came with the device did not tell you to program in the telephone number to VoiceAssist.  Instead the Jabra instructions tell you to call VoiceAssist making you assume it's already pre-programed in the device.<br />2. Managing your contacts online in the VoiceAssist web site is somewhat cumbersome as the tool is in its infancy. For instance, every time I edited one of my 100+ contacts it kept going back to the first one after I saved the edit--then I had to scroll through the entire list again to go back to where I wanted to in the contact list.<br />3. Answer/End button is not intuitive on the Jabra unit (it's the phone icon on the Jabra Freeway); although the instructions do tell you where it's located.<br />4. The Jabra Freeway did not always understand my voice commands  Voice Assist understood my commands much better but  that still was not perfect)<br />5. Jabra is from the UK and only an automated help line is provided along with a website.  Other than this you can send an email and wait for a response--no live support here<br /><br />In summary, although Jabra will work with any Bluetooth phone, I did not feel I could get it to work exceptionally well with the Verizon LG phone I tried it with.  I cannot be sure whether it was because of my or my boyfriend's voices (as we both tried it), the phone, or just the functionality of the device.  Despite this, the Jabra Freeway is a very sleek unit and I felt that it responded better the more familiar I got with the device.  In addition, the other reviewers are raving about the Freeway.  Although VoiceAssist was not perfect, I absolutely loved that optional add-on.<br /><br />Updated May 30, 2011 - I sent an email to Jabra with two simple questions to see how responsive their email support was and I can tell you it's great.  I sent it over the weekend and got a response this morning.  The only thing that wasn't great was that one of my simple questions was answered wrong.  I had asked where the answer/end button was and according to the manual it is the phone icon on the Jabra device; however the reponse I got was to \"Slide the On/Off power switch to turn the speakerphone on or off\" so the question was either misunderstood or the tech did not know the answer. I think it's the former.<br /><br />Updated November 7, 2011 - I recommended this to a former colleague and this is what he said about the device verbatim. \"Regarding the Jabra device, it has worked very well.  I will admit, I have not used any of the advanced features much (other than initially playing with them) as honestly I have not needed them.  It has strictly been used as a straight bluetooth device and for that purpose it has worked extremely well.  The speaker quality is above and beyond competing devices and the functionality (recognizing bluetooth connections regularly, turning off when it doesn't detect a device, etc) are features that are useful and allow it to stick out from the pack of competing devices.  Overall, it has proven useful when I needed it.\"",

Even if necessary to glance at the map.. I love its location far above any others!! Having dash level is closest to eye level- so it eliminates gazing around or looking downward and not OUT front window.. all bc phone placed within the plane of the windshield space.. it keeps eyes where they should be!!<br /><br />Would recommend for any car, especially one with a new and/or younger driver! Creates great habits to not take eyes off of looking forward. For a $15 price this has what you need- hoping info helps decision… Stay safe everyone!",

Connections fit snug and secure.. nothing loose or dropping signal once connected. Still offers use of phone while charging. Lightening cord boosted battery from 4% to full in just under 2hr. Ha! No dreaded “not compatible with device” error message.. no hot spots on phone or cord either- whew!<br /><br />**Discrepancy in cord length must be noted- curled cord is NOT 6ft long!! Not even close.. this is actually a 3ft. cord that runs shorter bc of curled shape.. offer same charge function but different tangle free feature at approx. 16”soft- 31” stretched. I prefer straight cord however, this is helpful in car not to let excess slack tangle- it's 100% a personal preference! Note photo included showing folded size.. makes this easy to go mobile with you!!<br /><br />Bonus: signal light on when using car port in socket.. x2 items charge at once and tangle free cord with small footprint for travel. With x2 sets it offers use in multiple cars, or an at home/on the go option.. just keep x1 as backup if needed. Best of all- its Apple certified to be compatible and used with Apple device.

Being her 4th year of doing so.. she's perfected the art of leaving her travel bag ready- with one outlier.. she only has x1 Apple Watch charger and it gets forgotten a lot.. making her crazy once the watch dies out!! Ha.. here in lies her salvation- simple, small and unassuming to pack up.. it attaches to keyring so, it won't be forgotten! This has been far more then helpful- not only does she use watch for social and norm. convenience.. she tracks all physical activity, heart monitoring, stats etc. on the watch- Now, it's “game on” (sorry, I couldn't help it!) for continued watch use whether at home or on the go.. Awesome find!!<br /><br />Magnetic Connection feels just as secure as original charger and no lag in charge time noticed. Connects to wall butt or computer port with a snug/secure fit. Charged overnight it's ready for use the next day.. For total transparency: she'll use for her backup- not everyday use and it's solid as such!<br /><br />A perfect gift for any and certainly ideal for those on the go or who travel frequently. Great idea for business travelers as well. Simple ease and convenience for having a 2nd charger meant for packing small and going with you! Easy to leave in backpack or connect to key ring- and never be lost or forgotten. All for under $10.. yay! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone!",

Something to keep in mind when selecting.. who is the end-user and how will it be put into action! With this brand.. you'll be getting more than just the quality name but also it's trusted intelligence!!<br /><br />For any familiar with orange therapy workouts- this can withstand the sweating and not feel yuck during your hour regiment.. perforated holes allow just enough breathability and used in this capacity for over a dzn. sessions- we've had zero adverse reaction. Rip curl is a trusted brand proven for the ocean activity and it crosses over to land just fine-<br /><br />Sized small enough for even tinier wrists- if uncertain which size.. I'd err on sizing up. Connecting to Apple Watch is easy and seamless- no issues staying put as buckle can slide into place without issue and can even be done with x1 hand!

So, something to think about for your end-user. Tbh, prob not best option I'd let my teen use who always seems to be dropping the phone and a bit careless with it. But if you're looking for something that brings a thin extra layer of protection.. this is it! Phone does fit nicely with a protective glass over the front screen- I find its cut to be used in unison. This combo also increases the overall protection. Hoping info helps decision.",

Eliminates charge cord mayhem by having “one cord to rule them all.” This cord offers a trifecta of uses: AirPods, cellphone or Apple Watches.. it eliminates so much cord clutter and is ideal for travel. This is a must have for one who owns “the big 3” listed above!!<br /><br />Cord itself has respectable feel.. although this isn't reinforced at any of its “vulnerable weak points..” Length is a tad short- so, must use next to wall outlet. Produces solid charge connection with all x3 devices.. It even allows a charge thru a thinner 14phone case.. fourth gen. AirPod + Apple Watch also connected no prob. I don't see a notable change in charging speed- but, it is steady and solid.. Where this is best served is eliminating cords!<br /><br />For a price point under $20- It makes a great stocking stuffer or spoiler for any with multiple iPhone devices. So far so good!!

These have single-handedly saved my phone from drops that would break, fall into water.. or even from setting down and misplacing.. I truly spin it around and wear it on the outside of my hand “ring style” when hands are full of other things. It's like the best multitasking tool for moms.. AmAziNg!!!<br /><br />These are soooo easy to use-<br />1. Find spot most comfortable for hand size and device..<br />2. clean surface of your desired location-<br />3. Peel off adhesive..<br />4. Place exactly right first try- removing to adjust hinders perf. hold!<br />5. Use away! Use until ring becomes loose or adhesive begins to lift.<br />*  Replace with backups in the set by repeating above steps.<br /><br />Such a clever and simple little gadget that has made life easier and the added benefits for keeping my phone safe has made me all the more convinced- these should be built-in to all phones!! Should be noted: I place phone in a protective case and place holder on outside. Doing so keeps phone 100% free of any adhesive etc.<br /><br />Set priced under $10- is a solid find.. Will order again when needed! For any interested.. you won't be disappointed- but, you may find yourself codependent on them in the future! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

We tend to forget- most handle camera equipment with such grace.. and yet, phones made with these incredible cameras as of late and here we shove them into our pockets, purses, backpacks, accidental drop.. you get the idea! If I tell you nothing else… Protect the lens, it wont hinder photos in any way!!<br /><br />This all inclusive set allows easy application with simple to follow instructions.. Easy-peasy!

Better yet, if damaged while protecting device- you have replacements all ready and waiting.<br /><br />Fit aligns to cutouts + edge complete with a nice beveled finish.. No ledge/edge to get caught up on.

Trust me, phone took a direct hit face planting into the tile.. I expected shattered glasses in a pool of my tears!!!

I have zero complaints.. even the price point of $22- Im happy to pay for an item that can truly meet and surpass my needs.. This is one device I wouldnt hesitate to recommend.<br /><br />A great item on the go- it easily slips into a purse, backpack, briefcase, luggage etc.. it's smaller foot print and weightlessness make it so nice!

You don't even have to remember to bring it along.. attach to one's key ring- it's always there!! A short cord with x3 charge end options that magnetically creates a circle into itself.. Attach to briefcase, backpack, purse just the same.. Anywhere you've been in a bind needing a charge but were missing a cord! Ha.. Welcome to the problem solver!<br /><br />Used IOS end with iPhone 8+, USB-C with iPhone 13, and standard USB with Bluetooth speaker.. All had solid connection with zero issues or any spotty disconnect. Better yet, fit is tight but not forced- no slipping to lose charge connection.<br /><br />I included up close photos- note plastic “flip slide ends” are solid and not cheap/flimsy.. not easily breakable.. Thick elastic material that covers connecting wires feels sturdy and durable. If you view pic.'s in succession.. you can see how ends function and snap + slide in/out of casing.<br /><br />Short! Cord provides just enough length to get from power source to device.. not a sliver more!! I do wish this had at least some type protection for the charge ends left exposed.. it seems necessary to keep from accidental damage.  I also wish this had a built in jump ring that was 100% secure. Although magnet circular connection is strong and seems to stay in place- peace of mind knowing it can't fall off or undo.. is priceless.<br /><br />Overall, this is solid for $12.99 and will hopefully step up when in a bind.. after x1-2 issues (usually with travel) this should rectify future incidents. A great gadget gift or stocking stuffer.. with options- i'm sure it will come in handy! Hoping info helps your decision- stay safe everyone..",

This solid option holds a charge even when not in use. Battery won't deplete just on its own- all bc it has on/off switch!<br /><br />LED screen gives real time accuracy so, it's easy to know if/when juice is running low and time to recharge unit. WoW..!! Talk about rapid time- refilled my low battery (10% left.) in approx. 1hr. I've NeVeR seen a faster boost at work! (I have old fashion iPhone 8+..!!)<br /><br />Clever built in port and cord options (usb/c port)- no prob. if caught without or with the wrong one. A perk cords attach and store tightly into booster itself. NOTE: cord is short (see photos I included) so, it's not the easiest to use/charge device at same time due to shorter length and angle. **Careful with cord itself.. it's a “one and done” with these!! IF cord is damaged or breaks- it can't be replaced (and we all know.. cords see plenty of wear and tear..) Deep breath: you CAN still use boost with your own cord- you just lose “all inclusive convenience.”<br /><br />Built robust-device is durable + protected. Fits standard pant pocket or into a purse/backpack with ease. *Only thing I wasn't expecting was its weight!! My one issue with it yet, willing to overlook bc of its outstanding performance. This is small and mighty but, hefty! (small as it is- still tugs down on pant pocket by just weight alone.. something to be aware of!)<br /><br />Investing in one a substantial booster will far outlast others and perform beyond expectations. Ultimately, it pays for itself in spades! This $39 booster has it's privileges.. worth it 100%. Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe!",

    "text": "This has the ability to make itself very useful- especially for any who travel or are in the go a lot.. helps great with a family- with numerous devices and varying charge cords.. this does the heavy work for you! The variety of cords are actually attached to battery boost and tuck into backside nicely.. making this an all inclusive power source for when you need it most!<br /><br />Pros: cord are short and attached for ease and convenience. No need to carry excess items or worry if you have appropriate/specific charge cord. Overall device is sleek and neat. Small in size- tucks into purse, briefcase, backpack easily. Multiple units charged before battery boost itself needs to be replenished. Booster feels strong and sturdy.. no loose rattle or fragile pieces to snap off or break. Does its job- can charge a depleted battery back to full status. Power on the move is so convenient!!<br /><br />Cons: battery boost itself doesn't come with it own charging adapter to replenish booster when power is drained. There is no way to replace the attached cord if one bends or fails over time.. and charge cords DO fail! Device isn't able to support high speed charging cord in a port.. only standard speed- so, a bit longer to complete task.<br /><br />For price point of $39- I expect a lot from a battery boost! This items sole purpose is to help when another item is failing (am I right?!) and it should do so with an easy, mobile carrying convenience.. Facts: If needing a charge from a battery booster- it's obviously on the go!! (Otherwise, one would just use wall plug!) So far, this has been powerful in holding a charge and easy fitting into on the go routine. This may seem a bit extra but, it best fits  any with varying devices.. Or a family that falls in that same category. With 4 kiddo's (teen + older..) they all seem to have their preference of electronic devices yet, are good at forgetting a charge cords when out.. Ha! Problem solved- this fills that need in spades! Ive got power- and the cord to use it! Hoping this info helps your decision.. stay safe.",

This also allows for 2 variations of USB charge cords.. a total convenience- if, your device at home use a different charge cord than the one provided with purchase.. you can eliminate the extra!<br /><br />TBH, this will replenish a depleted battery faster then any other Power boost I have owned.. (and I've owned close to 20 with a family of 6..!!) This little charger can take a device from less than 10% to 100% in under x45min-x1 hr.!! But, it will deplete booster a bit fast. If fully charged, this has enough power to recharge our iPhone 8+ twice before it's pretty much spent.. I feel the perk with this is definitely in the speed at which it replenishes!<br /><br />This is slim and not overweighted- and designed about the same size/build as an iPhone 8+.. so, this can slide into ones pocket, purse or backpack no problem.<br />Overall, I recommend without hesitation- for the price, you'll definitely get moneys worth and be happy about it.

    "text": "This is a solid tempered glass screen Protector for iPhone 11- Only, this has an added bonus of being a privacy screen for those who want to keep information on their device safe guarded.<br />Basically, when looking straight on… The user can easily see their own information on screen. However, those around you or peering over your shoulder from an angle- don't get that privilege..!! TBH, after a flight in close proximity with strangers- I realized the person next to me.. was 100% reading the content on my device.. Are you kidding me?!!  This eliminates those type of situations.. But, it's not just for those without manners or, boundaries.. this is also a way to keep information safe and protect any passwords or private data you may type in or, have displayed on your screen... it really works! (which brings me to question… Why doesn't apple build this type of safety into the original phone screen for all said reason..?! Hmm..)<br /><br />Applying this is straightforward and necessary items are included- only, my screen “cleaner wipe” was dried out- and I'll admit.. aligning this with exact openings gave me an overall 98.9% perfect fit. Of course, it will do the job but.. if your OCD like myself- this may drive you crazy knowing that the exact notches are almost perfect but not quite.<br />so, for those two stated reasons..I deducted x1 star. Of course, One can utilize a different cleaner.. but, if the “kit” is all inclusive then it should be. And the fit- knowing it may be me being hyper critical.. and the fact, it seems to be performing its job well on both fronts- protecting my information and also, the screen on my device- I would definitely not call these deal breakers!<br />Sold as a pair at a decent price point.. I would definitely recommend and as a mom of 4 (and a husband who is a large child) I would not let a device be used without screen protection!! I hope this info helps your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "Loving the idea of this swivel stand and wishing it could perform stronger to all it's listed capabilities.. However, the overall structure is a bit less then, and has limitations to just be sturdy enough for the iPhone 8+..<br /><br />Best feature is the swivel base!!  If, you're anything like our house- It is a constant sharing of something posted online with one another…this is nice to twist and turn. I'm usually the mom in the kitchen cooking.. and kids at the counter will twist this handy little number around to show me, and it's nice to not have to touch/hold phone to see what they're sharing.. The swivel will allow me to see keeping my “hands off” the device when this is happening! This feature will be helpful during any online learning- and what I was hoping for most.. with at home learning during quarantine, we found the watching of a lesson online was a bit obnoxious to angle toward more then, one person.. the ability to twist screen between 2.. would be helpful In this department.<br /><br />However, the base is not weighted adequately and the item can wiggle or move around on top. Not the best when holding your device.. the one thing we are looking for is something secure!<br />This does offer 2 slots for various size phones but, they do not have different widths.. translation: if your phone is in a protective case, chances are it will not fit in this holders slot at all.. this is something that definitely should be reconfigured..  The last thing I want is for kids to be constantly removing their device from the protective layer. Especially, if something is unstable it would drop without added protection. Note: A pop socket will not interfere ONLY if, it's placed directly on the phone. The configuration of the handle allows the pop socket to stay put- (our issue is, pop socket is on our case!!)<br /><br />The back support built into this device does support an 8+ (if we take phone case off to make any of this work..) Only, I feel this needs a back support made of metal vs. Plastic. bc, I fear over multiple uses, this support will begin to lose integrity. Im not sure how long the thinner, plastic material will hold up.. as it may possibly snap off too much extra pressure!?<br /><br />Having cord storage in the base is a great idea in theory but, take note.. Most cords purchased aftermarket are made more convenient and have longer length- that will not fit. This CAN store the standard cord that is supplied with your device at purchase.. takes a little bit of patience to make it fit. If, not stored coil style nice and evenly… Otherwise, the plastic door has a struggle closing down tightly. Personally, with a support stand- I find this to be an extra that can cause more harm than good.** IF, this space was weighted with a heavy material vs. used for cord storage.. it could lend a solution to some of its shortcomings!<br /><br />Yes! You hear a bit of mechanical noise in the gear.. This wasn't a deal breaker but, I did improve the issue. HACK: I all but fixed it with just a DOT of lubricant placed on a Q-Tip head! The tiniest amount is necessary to resolve this annoyance.<br /><br />Overall, for the Price point…which is under $10- I feel, this is not a huge investment and one could get their moneys worth, if they are aware of the few caveats and quirks this has- and adjust accordingly. I wouldn't be surprised if we see this design continue to be perfect it because, the general idea in theory behind it is great!",

    "text": "You know that happiness… When you find an item for a good deal and it's worth twice as much? Well, this is one of those items… If nothing else you are getting a quality case for under $20!!<br /><br />•It arrives in a protective sleeve keeping the clear coating free from scratch/smudge.. The back appears made out of protective Crystal clear glass.. I'm loving that!! I love that you can see the actual iPhone for all its sleek and sexy lines- why buy an awesome looking phone and cover it up with bulk?!<br /><br />•The material used is 100% top grade. Trust me, I ordered two cases and the $7 alternative- looks like it..Cheap and foggy compared to this side by side. (Wish I could attach a photo to show extreme difference in material quality.) you just have to trust me on this one..<br /><br />•This had a barely bendable hardness to the case which I appreciate- a bit easier to put on the device without thinking something's going to break.<br /><br />•Cutouts align as they should and yes!! You can use a wireless charging in this case, as long as you don't use pop socket or ring attached to the back!!<br /><br />• Has the raised edge not only around front glass screen… But, also camera itself. Which, I feel is a must of you want to protect all THREE cameras.. um, yes please!!!<br /><br />• reinforced corners do not add any extra bulk to the case- making this barely sized bigger than the phone itself… But, giving the protection of bubble wrap-<br /><br />Hate to say it but, 2 accidental drops both, onto travertine tile from counter height… And not a scratch or crack on phone OR, case, totally shocked both drops!! That is quality and peace of mind in my book- So, if you're looking for an item that does it's job for a decent $ and looks good doing it... this is the case for you!!<br /><br />Hope this info helps..  feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "Straightforward, strong and sturdy iphone case for the iPhone 8 plus. Due to the age of iPhone, this size model is harder to get your hands on… Making me all the more impressed to see the Kit Me Out World case is rock-solid!!<br /><br />This is a little stubborn to get on as it doesn't have a lot of bend.. Honest, it gives me confidence in the tightness of the overall fit… I've used other cases in the past that almost appear “too loose“ from the start- Although this is a rubberized plastic, it basically offers very little bend.. giving just enough to snap into position- i'm guessing over time this will wear and have more give. just note: this may be a bit difficult for any who like to swap cases often. Me personally, I like to lock and load… Only replacing when necessary!<br /><br />This case provides the raised edges that are a must for screen protection and with a slightly higher rounded edge it is capable to protect the actual glass on both, front/back from a full frontal drop!!<br />Cutouts align nicely and charging cord can slip in/out without any resistance- This feels firm in overall corner structure as well- this has a rounded bumper style protection.. Overall, the case provides the needed security and does so, without creating unnecessary bulk- this case also allows for cordless charging as well.. no need to take off case, as long as no pop socket/ring is used on the back!!<br /><br />Would recommend an order again. Personally I chose Crystal clear with black edging. I appreciate the ability to visually see the phone and this case lets you keep the integrity of the look but, provides protection of your investment.. win/win!!<br /><br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",

    "text": "Ohh, how I wanted and needed this to be accurate!!<br />I ordered the day my husband received his new iPhone device…and wanted to protect right out of the box. However, product stated iPhone 11- yet, when it arrived- it's actually said for the 11 Pro..!! **So, pay attention to specific/exact measurements with these products and do not just order off of the name/wording!! (I included a photo with the discrepancy- hopefully it can be easily fixed and keep someone else from my same issue.. If you look you see- it states compatible with iphone11.. and 2nd line states iphone11pro. Problem = the 2 devices are diff. in size and by approximately 4mm. In the end, try as we might we looked like “Cinderella's stepsister trying time make the slipper fit!” and had a good laugh!!<br /><br />As far as examination of the product- it appears straightforward and no nonsense, no whistle‘s… No bells… Just how my husband prefers a case (easy in/out of pocket.. no pattern or, dangles!) Our order was for crystal clear colorless case and thats what this is 100%! It came with insert of protective foam, keeping it safe from scratches.. a cleaning pad to wipe down prior to applying is a nice perk. Honest, when you buy a phone that in itself is sexy.. you want to show it off. This is a nice way to protect and still enjoy the look of the iPhone.<br /><br />Corners appear to be most protected/reinforced.. And due to the fact- corners usually take the brunt of a fall.. I find this a must have!! The added feature of a raised edge around camera (ok, 3 cameras!) is great- anything to help protect without giving bulk.. is a great feature for me!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, how well it performs on the device.. I cannot contribute due to advertising error!!<br /><br />But, If looking for a no frills, straightforward case that is soft/pliable but, at same time stiff/sturdy.. and made of a clear scratch free plastic- This Seems like a great find in a case and the fact it is offered at a fair price. win win win..!!!<br />I hoped this info. helped… Feel free to say so!",

This has all the creature comforts and construction a stand of this nature should have in order to work.. it feels as if it's lacking the “meat” or, integrity to feel stable (If that makes sense?!!)<br />It does say “phone stand” and I was trying to balance an Android mini G pad (which is only 1x1 bigger then, I phone and no such luck!)<br /><br />Now, the iPhone 8+.. definitely did better and yesss!!! This 100% should only be used with smaller devices- However, as I was trying to prop iPhone in place- the stand was sliding each attempt and this was on my solid kitchen surface.. The equilibrium compatibility of the two items is bit of a struggle to get together. My iphone ringer is also set to vibrate- and when a call came in.. the phone fell sideways out of the holder (if that gives you an indication of stability?!)<br /><br /> TBH, when this arrived… I wasn't even sure what it was coming out of the package! So, It does fold up very compact and as probably assumed post my issues listed above… This is very light weight. Placed inside a bag or backpack, one would not even know it was there! Because it's made of plastic with a few moving parts…It does have the capability to snap or, break- (be careful not to Get it sandwiched in between heavy books!!)<br /><br />Bottom line, there are better options for this type accessories that are more stable and comparable in price.

    "text": "The best invention since sliced bread… I don't understand why a cell phone doesn't come equipped with this type of handle built-in? For the mom of four kids who is constantly multitasking and doing so, with 62.5 Things in her hand at any given time… I love that I can hook this to my finger and not worry about dropping or, can even use as handle to carry while carrying other items as well!!<br /><br />This is straightforward to put on and can be placed directly onto the cell phone back… I didn't choose to do that as I didn't want gummy residue left on my actual iPhone. Nor, did I want my iPhone naked and not protected without a case - So, I put this on the outside of my case and it went on without any issue.<br /><br />I know this can be used as a stand to prop your device and watch video. Although I do not use it in this capacity… It is an added feature or bonus!<br /><br />The stick is pretty immediate so, take the time to make sure it's straight and in your appropriate range to feel comfortable when holding phone. For my hand size… The actual placement is directly in the middle and slightly longer than halfway in center of the phone. Before taking the sticker off, put ring on middle finger and align to a comfortable fit- and mark it! this is the best way to ensure you get the appropriate placement.<br /><br />One way to improve this product- Would be to include a “card stock template square” such as a (3x4)?. Something with straight edges and having a cutout into the middle- of the ring adhesive shape and size.. that way, it could be used to align the item exactly straight when placing the semi permanent adhesive onto the actual device.<br />If a straight edged of a template could easily align with at least x1 side of any said devices edge..<br /><br />Overall, these are worth their weight in gold. They do not take away from the overall look of the case. The clear adhesive makes only the metal ring stand out. Definitely a must have in my opinion as it has save me from dropping my phone and causing damage more times than I could ever count!",

    "text": "I'm in love!! I have to admit- in the past I've been using the case with the phone ring built in- as I felt it was safer in the fact, the ring was not going to let loose and ultimately make me drop the phone.. However, I must have smaller hands as, the ring was placed far too high in middle of the phone and was not comfortable at all. The stretch my hands had to try and do was a joke..<br />This is when I decided to try a regular phone case and Adhere my own ring onto the back- Wow!  What a difference it made. When you can choose the placement of the ring… It is actually comfortable, useful and I have never had any problem with adhesive coming loose. In fact, it's quite the opposite… If you use a ring adhesive on a phone case -be prepared for it to be there for life! Or, at least some residue of it!<br />Being a mom who's always on the go with x4 kids, a mom who needs to constantly have a phone in hand- this ring is the best invention ever made and a universal life saver. I do know it can be used as a phone stand.. and I've had that purpose tried by kids needing entertainment “TV” style. But, I like the fact that in a pinch.. you can be the totally lame mom and spin the phone on the outer side of your hand (like an obnoxious ring!!!) and actually utilize your hands to carry or multitask and trust me-  no matter how much you don't want to be that person… With this feature, eventually you'll use it and see how helpful it can be! I made it thru the airport this way- never once having to search or ask- “where in the world did I set my phone..?” the words I may have engraved on my tombstone (no, I'm not proud.. but, it is so fitting these days!)<br /><br />So, if you're wanting to have the ease of using your phone, carrying it with you and when needed, utilizing the ring to simplify the multi-tasking.. this is a must get. Don't hesitate about the safety- as the adhesion sticks and does the trick.. you can even hook the ring on any small odd object that pokes out- and that has been just an extra perk I've found while using..**life hack: I hang the ring on a cupboard handle when following an online recipe. Boom! The phone hangs perfect at my eye level and makes it so easy to follow along.. but, hands down the best part of having this feature- is the ability to be hands free as needed. All while keeping phone on back side of your hand! And if you're ever not needing to use the ring- it fold down on itself so, the phone can still slide easily into the back pocket. **note that wireless chargers usually don't work with this attachment on the back of the phone- it's placement must be about the same spot as the wireless signal for the battery charging- I point that out, in case it's a deal breaker for any of you...?!<br /><br />This is simple to put on- but, I suggest before exposing the glue strip.. put your ring on hand as you would use it.. and set phone on top (that way you can move the phone around to different positions.. till you find spot that feels most comfortable.) Then, before you move it to expose the glue strip- just mark the back with a tiny mark/dot.. and this will insure its placed where YOU want it! From there, you just follow the easy step/step instructions.. and that's it!",

We can see that th evasion is super locked down and with rubber attached to the lenses, it would be easy to change lenses on a wet day, but not submerged in water.  There is thin hard case for the phone, that can doublemup as hard case for the phone before placing it into the waterproof case.  Once in the case, you don't loose any of the functionalities, excep you have to swipe harder on the screen.  Love that the lenses come in their own protective soft pouch.  Lenses are not bad, even if just basic.",

I've had other types with previous phones and this one is the worst for the strap. Just a thin piece holds the strap to the phone. Don't swing your arms or pull on it too hard because the strap may break. When you use your hard earned money on a phone, putting its safety in the hands of a less than mediocre strap is crazy!",

Why does this message keep popping up on my phone?  Clearly I'm not connected because I removed the phone from the headset. Yet the message keeps popping up.

That isn't a fault of this product, per se, just something to think about when adding something like this onto your phone. I stuck it on my case, and it has stuck very well. It doesn't work as a stand as well as I would like it to. It has a tendency to swivel and you have to fuss with it to get it to stand in just the right way. After 2 months of use, the rose gold finish is chipping off and it looks pretty bad. I imagine I'll have to remove it pretty soon because it just looks awful. It does help, especially with a plus-sized phone, to hold the phone with one hand and text or scroll.

The belt kind work, but then your phone isn't accessible, so if you're using certain apps, it can be difficult with the belt. So, this one works similar to a handheld water bottle. You strap it to your hand with your thumb through the loop. Seems simple.<br />First problem, the phone portion is going to be hard. Like, that side won't wrap or mold around your hand. I know you are used to holding your phone all day, but for some reason, it was just awkward in this case and didn't let the case fit the hand very well.<br />Second problem is that the band around the back of your hand is not stretchy. So you can't get it very tight. The material is a weird neoprene type thing, which is good for not letting your sweat get all over the phone, but the fit is just bad.<br />Third problem is that the band around the back of your hand is the length of you phone. So, for me, with small hands, the back just won't fit very securely. With the thumb loop, you can keep the phone in your hand, but I hand to hold it more than I like for an activity phone holder.<br />Fourth problem is the plastic sits on my phone screen really oddly. It makes viewing the screen really difficult because it bubbles and sticks to the screen. Now, I have an Essential phone and it barely fits in this case. So, maybe that is what makes the plastic over the screen weird.<br />I normally don't have a problem wearing an in hand water bottle, but for some reason this just didn't feel at all natural. I think I could really love a handheld cell phone holder, but this one just isn't it.",

I've had three or four Android phones now and none of them have been very impressive.<br />The box arrived and it made me nervous. I opened it and there were no paper instructions. So I hid the box for a few days until I got some quite time to sit and figure it out. Turns out, that wasn't really necessary. It was super simple. Push the power button and it walks you through the entire set up. I didn't even have to call my cell phone provider to switch to the phone. Just popped the SIM card out of one phone and put it in the other. Easy. The phone held my hand and walked me through each step.<br />The screen is impressive. Pictures look so crisp and pretty. The colors are so vivid and I love the to-the-edge image.<br />I really like the fingerprint scanner being on the back. The thumb scanner on the front has never made sense to me. It isnt' a natural way to hold a phone. With this one, the way you naturally pick up the phone unlocks it.<br />The size is great. It isn't so small that I have trouble typing. But not so huge it is awkward.<br />It runs really well. The camera isn't great on it, but you can upgrade it.<br />It has no headphone jack. It does come with an adaptor, but I still have issue with it. Mainly, use in the car. I like to be able to plug my phone in to charge and plug the auxiliary cord in at the same time to run music for the kids while not draining my battery. Now, I have to decide which one I want to do AND I have to make sure I have the adaptor. I know phones are moving away from the auxiliary port, but I hate that they are. It does work with Bluetooth headphones that I have.<br />The finish on it isn't ideal. It is just really shiny all over, so it makes fingerprint smudges all over the phone. A case would easily solve the problem, but since this is a new product, cover options are awfully slim at the moment.<br />Overall, I actually like the phone, which is more than I can say for my previous Android devices. It works well and easily. It has lots of storage. So, the pluses outweigh the negatives for me.",

It does reach the bench right behind the driver, but no further than that. (Sorry to those on the back two rows.) You can plug up to 5 devices in at a time. With all 5 plugged in, charging is a bit slower. It does better with only one or two things plugged in. But if everything is dying all at once, plugging everything in is an option and it does charge them, just not quite as fast. In a normal size car, you would be able to plug your device or two in up front and then let the backseat passengers use the other end to plug in their devices. In an SUV or minivan, you can reach the middle row of seats, but the far back row would be a bit of a stretch, but could likely be done.",

It matches the other four cords perfect and actually due to a little cap that makes the cable into a little loop, it is actually even better than the others.<br /><br />Price is good and as long as they live up to the quality they appear to have, I highly recommend these cables.  So far they have worked on two gens of iPhone and two gens of ipad.  Couldn't be happier.",

I really didn't think I would like the flip open case, but the the magnet that holds the case shut, also does a great job of holding the flap out of the way.  Now I am really liking the protection over the screen.<br /><br />The materials are really nice.  It has a rich leathery feel to the flat surfaces and a decent, although plasticky feel to the outside edges.  The buttons work great through the case and the camera port is wide and recessed for safety.  I'm really liking the case for it's style and security.",

    "text": "Perhaps the greatest compliment this case has gotten was from the three people who said \"You should get a case to protect your phone.\"  To which I point out that it already has one.  It just fits so elegantly on the phone that it just seems to be part of the phone.  The way the buttoms are covered with rubberized covers makes the case seem like the phone itself.  The buttons seem to work perfectly fine through the case.  Also the camera and flash seem well protected in their little recessed area. It's not bulky but seems quite protective.<br /><br />The case fits my phone perfectly and firmly.  There is a little strangeness about it's feel in your hand.  There are some kind of sharp edges.  Not cut your finger sharp, but feel funny in your hand sharp.  I've gotten used to it, but it is not a smootly rounded, ergonomic feel.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Great Looks.<br />- Button Covers work Great and give the feel that there is no cover<br />- It has a nice solid feel to it<br /><br />Cons<br />- Back Scratches easily (but at least it's not my phone)<br />- Does not come with a screen protector film.<br />- Edges have sharp right angles which make it feel a little less than ergonomic (not a big thing)<br /><br />Summary<br />I have recommended this cover to friends and co-workers.  It just seems like a nice, albeit imperfect, iphone case.",
