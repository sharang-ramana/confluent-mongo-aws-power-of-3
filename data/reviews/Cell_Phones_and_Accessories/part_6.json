I have never had such a bubble free application of a screen protector before in my considerable experience with cell phones over the years. The iSmooth company is putting out not just a superior product but great customer service. I read the inserts and everything inside the package and a good thing I did! I was directed to their website and it had a great video demonstration of how to apply the screen protector! I was so shocked and amazed that a little direction can go a very long way.<br /><br />Thanks iSmooth! You have a new and very happy customer with your product, the packaging, everything that is included with the screen protectors and some truly awesome customer service. You don't just get a tiny dust cloth with these screen protectors you get a full size cloth. Okay, I didn't measure it, but it was the same size if not larger than my new cell phone which has a 5.5&#34; screen. It has a thank you card! Can you believe it. It also has some little stickies that you can use to get dust from between the screen and screen protector if you find any there after the installation.<br /><br />I think many people feel that the directions should be enough to apply something as simple as screen protectors and for many that may be the case, but I am just telling you that it made a huge difference in my experience to have the video and not just the directions, which are also included on a card insert with the product.<br /><br />So last but not least, they offer assistance while you are on the website if you desire it. Now this is something truly great in my opinion. Live help online while you shop or watch a product video. I am very happy I made this choice and I don't feel like I need to look for anything better. Thanks iSmooth, you are appreciated!",

At the time I bought the tablet there were very few covers available. I bought another model from this same company. It was horrible and I returned it. This became available and I jumped at the chance. The biggest issue is the weight, this is over 8 ounces, half the weight of the tablet. It really bulks  up your lightweight table badly and that's disappointing. But it does a decent job of protecting the tablet. The case has magnets which turn the tablet on and off as you open it. Problem there is the way the case configures it covers the rear camera port so they put in a creased corner you can flop down and use the camera with the cover back. This corner also has magnets in it. They should have been left out of this section because it's so floppy it won't stay closed so it's constantly turning the table on and off as the case gets moved around. This is truly annoying though far less annoying than the cover I returned. I'm not 100% happy with this but it was necessary because the tablet was too slippery without a case. I'll live with it.",

I found my ports were getting some pocket lint in them, saw the Commuter case on a Gold Box special and jumped at the opportunity. Ten minutes on my phone was enough to decide, this is going back.<br />The inner lining is very soft and flimsy feeling. It didn't feel durable or protective. The outer hard-shell cover is thin, cheap plastic that feels brittle and easy to break. The Symmetry case had an overall texture that gave a positive feel in the hand. The hard parts of the Commuter are slick and slippery. It popped out of my hand just picking it up off the table. The covers for the charging and headphone ports are part of the inner material. Once wiggled free of the hard case they worked reasonably well. The one way in which this case was superior to the Symmetry is the ease of pressing the power button. The case material on the Symmetry is much stiffer which makes for a harder button press or double press to pull up the camera.<br />I honestly feel the Commuter case doesn't come close to the durability of the Symmetry and that it would not provide adequate protection for my phone.",

There's a nicely sloped bevel that allows your finger to easily and comfortably access the fingerprint sensor. This opening is one hole unlike many cases that have a piece of case unnecessarily dividing the opening (possibly interfering with the flash function).<br />The case is screen protector friendly coming right up to the edge of most protectors adding a good protective edge around the screen. The top and bottom of the case are raised several millimeters above the screen area keeping above any surface the phone is placed upon.<br />The Otterbox Symmetry is thick enough to inspire confidence in its protection but doesn't add a lot of weight or bulk.<br />The Symmetry case supports fast wireless charging.

    "text": "The case is really easy to hold though the built up corners have an edge that can dig into your hand. Feels very confident it won't slip and slide around when you're holding it. Phone goes into the case nicely, there's enough resistance so it won't fall out but no real struggle to slip it on the phone. All buttons easy to use while installed. This case is screen protector friendly. The dual colors are attractive especially on my blue Galaxy S9. My biggest issue is this thing picks up fingerprints and smudges better than the entire cast of CSI. After a day of using the phone the case is grossly covered in fingerprints and greasy smudges.",

I've never bought anything from Wish, I've see all sorts of YouTube videos where people buy Wish.com junk and make fun of it. I just didn't realize I was buying Wish.com junk. The pad I bought these to replace was easily twice as thick as these 'Funrarity' (WISH) pads and when it was new I could stick pens and sundry down and pick up the pad having everything stay put. I sometimes had to work to get my pens free. But dust, grease, oils and time took their toll so I went looking for a replacement. Unfortunately for me, I found these. They are flimsy, so thin you can literally SEE through them. I have used these pads to keeps pens, small tools, screws and bolts from going flying as things get moved around on my table. Nothing is sticking to these. They're useless garbage. Thankfully I threw away less than $3 on this lesson.",

I've had the protector on and off three times (only once using the hinge stickers) and I don't want to ruin the adhesive ability of the screen protector.other than that small spot in the corner (there were worse but removing the hinges and just placing it by eye worked okay) combined with my Samsung rubber wrap around protector now I feel pretty safe carrying this phone around.

I tested the PaperWhite with and without this skin in place and there really wasn't that much of a difference with the amount of grip necessary to keep the Kindle from slipping from my hand.<br /><br />So... You have a skin that doesn't protect the part of the Kindle Paperwhite that's most in need of protection, the screen. Doesn't add a lot of protection to the back and sides of the device and isn't that much better for holding the Kindle.<br /><br />About the only good part of this skin is the power button cover of the Skin makes turning the Kindle PaperWhite on and off much easier.

A trusted companion for 2 years.<br />Well, I needed a replacement. My biggest wish was the largest screen for the buck. I wanted something big, fast and compatible for my eyes when mounted on my scooter for GPS and Waze. The size of this phone's screen was perfect. In no way was I going to spend $1000 for a phone. Only morons are stupid enough to do that.<br />The TCL was less than half the cost of my Huawei. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I couldn't believe the enhancements that had occurred over 2 years. The TCL is quick, responsive and has an excellent screen. The fingerprint and facial recognition systems work great and it does everything I want it to do perfectly. Even when I just have 1 or 2 bars showing, voice calls are crisp and clear.<br />I don't do games or social media (more moron territory) so I can't comment on that. But media playback from the Micro sd I installed is fast and immaculate on the screen and built in speakers. What's not to love? I also get 3 - 4 days use from a single charge.<br />In short, I adore this product. It does what it's supposed to do and it does it well.",

    "text": "I deleted the first review that I posted on the day after receiving this phone. It was a good review but it turns out that this phone is even better than I first thought.<br /><br />I replaced my Huawei Mate SE with this product. The Mate SE is a great phone but I needed a bit more RAM. When I saw the Honor View 10 with 6 GB and 128 GB of storage, I ordered it. I assumed it would be a Mate SE with a bit more kick. Turns out that this phone is way, WAY more :<br /><br />It charges fast. The battery life is incredible. The screen display, colors and resolution are phenomenal. Performance is FAST. The sound quality is a delight to hear. The Music and Video apps bundled with the phone aren't the greatest, but I use VLC and am very happy. How the heck did they get such wondrous and full sound to come out of those itty bitty speakers??? Watching a movie is great!!! I'm not a photographer, but I'm very happy with the photos it takes. This phone is a b@llbuster!<br /><br />By the way, I tried both the Galaxy S9+ and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. Wound up returning them both. They were okay, but they weren't that great, especially not in their respective price tags great. Unlike the Mate SE where the fingerprint sensor was away from the camera lenses, the S9+ and Mate 10 Pro had it right underneath the lenses. Fumble to touch the sensor and you smear the lenses. Not just dumb but moronic. The Honor View 10's fingerprint sensor is under the screen. Perfect! Now I can use my thumbs.<br /><br />This phone is just plain wonderful. Remember when you were a kid (I'm 60) and got that one toy at Christmas which you played with for more than a day, went back to that same toy over and over again and never got bored with it? This phone is that toy. Enjoy!!!<br /><br />A couple other things. I use this with Tracfone. Absolutely no problems. When I removed the Tracfone SIM from the Mate SE and installed it into this unit, I was instantly up and running. A great free app you can get from the Play Store is Network Cell Info Lite which will give you detailed information on your cell, wifi, signal, speed, etc. Seeing a map to your serving tower is really neat, too.",

Of course, I have to check the Mate SE for news and messages and I swear that now I get less accumulated debris on the screen and my fingertips seem to glide much more easily than they would on the SE's original screen.<br />So far I'm more than happy.

I have held it in both hands and tried to see if it twists like most thin plastic parts, and found that it doesn't.  it has 5 positions for different viewing angles.  that's nice.  once I know which works on the side table near the couch, I'll hot glue it in that position, as it's lightweight enough that when you pick this up, it will likely lose the position you liked.<br /><br />also, nice silicone rubber feet don't let it slide around on the desk or side table surface.  I am genuinely impressed with this low cost item, and for 2 of them.....I gotta say, I love it.  Thankfully, I won't be making it out of some scrap wood in the basement....for once, I will have something not \"hand-made\" in my LR.  sorry Dad...  :(<br /><br />an no, I'm not being paid to write this.  just an honest opinion from a mech design engineer!",

They are flimsy plastic, not ridged like the one I had on my last watch. You have to peel it off and there is no way to hold it on the sides because it isn't hard plastic (It's basically like Saran Wrap). Because of this there is no way to not get a finger print on the sticky side when you peel it off so even if you do get it on straight there is a smudge in the corner. I should have realized that something made to protect a screen should not come in a six pack. If they give you that many what are they really going to protect if I have to replace it 6 times?",

I think it doesn't rest perfectly flush on my wrist while wearing this band so it goes into lock mode which requires I key in my password. I like my bracelet watches to move on my wrist just a bit so it's more comfortable for me. With a smart watch that interferes with its function slightly. Now of course I could change my settings but it's a small issue that I don't mind much. Overall I happy with the band and will likely get a few more down the road. Highly recommend",

    "text": "The Momax powerbank comes in a decent package. It claimes to have a textured woven design. Initially I thought it would be like those pixel cases but it's not like that. It doesn't feel like cloth but rather a bit plastic-y but with a textured finish. Just a minor observation.<br /><br />The powerbank itself is sleek and lightweight. It has 1 USB 2.0 output for your cables with QC 3.0. For input it has 1 usb C and 1 lightning port. Which is great for both android and ios users. It has 10000mah battery which means you can keep it in your backpack and not worry about it for a while. Although it claims to charge 50% in 30mins but it was more like 30% in 30mins (using OnePlus Nord with 30w warp charging capabilities)<br /><br />It has wireless charging capabilities (10w) and it can charge smaller devices with it's low charging option (double click the button). The LED indicators aren't the great. Sometimes it's not clear as light bleeds from one LED to the next.<br /><br />In conclusion this is an excellent powerbank. It is sleek, lightweight and holds enough charge for most of your portable device charging needs<br /><br />Pros -<br />10000mah is more than enough<br />20w fast charging<br />10w wireless charging<br />Low charging mode for earbuds and smaller devices<br />Lightweight and modern<br /><br />Cons -<br />Charging time is average.<br />The battery indicators can be better",

My Mophie power banks dont take 2 days, unless ive used the xxl til its dead. My xxl is only 20,000mAh & takes about 12hrs. Its great others have enjoyed theirs but most of us got crap.

We set up the antenna as directed (upstairs pointed at the preferred tower using a free app from the app store) and put the amplifier downstairs (there is a lot of wire included, so go nuts).  Immediately ... 3-4 bars on T-Mobile, 4 bars on Verizon and 4-5 bars on AT&T.  We haven't had a single dropped call since we installed it.

Even with the warranty OtterBox requires a $10 replacement and $2.99 shipping fee for a replacement case! I decided not to get the replacement that didn't last... That's a bad investment and I should have known better from a previous poor experience with an OtterBox case.<br /><br />I've had Supcase cases in the past and have never had problems with them. They are well made, fit my previous phones great and are military drop graded. This one was priced less than the OtterBox and had better features. It is built better than the OtterBox also- you can use either the front frames with a built-in screen protector or the one without it.<br /><br />The one with the screen protector has a cutout so that the fingerprint reader functions better (the guide asks that you register your fingerprint again after installing the phone in the case). I did and it works great... The screen protector also works fine for swyping.<br /><br />There is a kick stand on the back of the case for hands-free watching the screen in horizontal or vertical mode.<br /><br />Also included a rotating belt clip holster. When everything is attached it's heavy but I am fine with it. It feels secure and I have peace of mind the phone is well protected.<br /><br />I'll update this review in a few months.<br /><br />UPDATE - 01/06/23: Ever since I began using this case I noticed my phone having connectivity issues no matter if I was using WiFi or the T-Mobile network. After all these months thinking the SIM card might need replacing I went to the T-Mobile website for troubleshooting advice.<br /><br />One suggestion worked 100%- remove the case. As soon as I did that the connections were robust. The phone was so much faster now that it could receive a great signal- WiFi or only T-Mobile.<br /><br />As much as I love the case I'll have have to return it.",

The adhesive on the handle won't adhere to silicon cases so if you have one you are instructed to use the screws included in the kit to screw on the handle without using the adhesive pad. This not a good solution because the screws are very tiny, it is nearly impossible to create holes in a silicon case (especially if it is thick) and the included screwdriver is so small you cannot place enough torque on it to drive the screws through the case into the handle. Solution? I used Gorilla Glue to adhere the handle to the case (the case only cost me $12 so I am not overly worried about harming it). Gorilla Glue will stick to anything and it did- success! Great handle however another solution needs to be included with this kit if you have a silicon military grade case.",

The case itself seems great.<br /><br />I have owned a few items from Otterbox and after reading the reviews for the Defender case I figured this was a tough enough case to keep my phone safe.  It looked great, fit the phone perfect and felt great in my hand.  From assemblying the phone into the case I thought I was going to be ok because it felt solid and very protected inside the Defender case.<br /><br />I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />On April 16th I was walking at work when the phone slipped off the holster that was on my hip and stuck the cement floor face first.  I didn't think much about it because the Otterbox Defender case is advertised as being able to protect from drops.<br /><br />When I picked up my phone and turned it over to look at the face I was aghast.  The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 was shattered into so many pieces I could not see anything on it except distorted rays of light.  I am 6'-1” tall and figured the phone fell from a distance of about 3 feet.<br /><br />The Defender case couldn't protect the phone from such a short distance?  The phone wasn't kicked, stepped on nor anything else- it fell to the cement floor face first.  Neither the phone nor the case had any modifications nor defects to either of them (perhaps the holster does- the phone was clipped in securely when I placed it there).<br /><br />I had insurance on the phone so for about 30% of the original price I got my replacement in one shipping day yet I am not sure Otterbox can make such great claims about a case that the phone didn't survive a 3 foot drop to a cement floor.  I wrote to Otterbox and their response was, of course, they cannot do anything for me.<br /><br />My replacement phone is back in the Toughsuit case which is advertised as “engineered to meet MIL-STD-810G military standards”- I will simply buy another Toughsuit case for the holster and get Bodyglove to send me a replacement holster also.<br /><br />I will never buy anything from Otterbox again.",

Only problem I had with that headset was it would lose it's connection during the call, turned out the sensors were malfunctioning and I had to turn them off via a computer app.  Worked great after that.  Purchased this replacement headset and it arrived quickly.  Within a few days the sensors started acting up and call would switch from headset to cell phone speaker during the call.  Connected it to my computer and disabled the sensors.  I really like the call clarity and the built-in features and should this new headset eventually fail, I will replace it with the same item, if available.",

You shouldn't pay five times as much for the same amount of protection with a slightly better pattern. Definitely overpriced.

    "text": "I do not know why case manufacturers don't seem to understand this model of phone (Moto Z3) uses Moto Mods. If you use Mods (which I do, all the time), you have to remove the case to attach them. Getting some cases off and on can be really frustrating--I tried several. If you use Moto Mods (I use multiple Qi charging + extended battery mods), you need a case that goes on and off easily, yet still provides plenty of drop and slip protection.<br /><br />The search is over--this is that case. I tried other, less expensive cases, and some were far too rigid to go on and off easily, and others too hard or slippery (lacking grip). Getting the more rigid ones on was a lot of work, and taking some of them off was almost impossible. The Speck case pops off and on easily, and their unique interior material provides plenty of shock absorption inside the hard outer shell. Yes, this is essentially a two-layer case in a single piece. This is BRILLIANT. The protection of a dual-layer case (hard outer shell with soft inner layer) without the hassle and time-consuming process of removing and reinstalling a two-piece case daily. Yes, it costs more, but it's worth it. My previous phone (Moto Z Force Droid) had a Speck case, and I am looking forward to years of use from this one.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this case are the raised rubber lines on exterior. These wrap around the sides of the case, and provide lots of grip and extra cushioning. These lines/ridges act like treads on a tire or an athletic shoe, providing traction on whatever surface you place the phone. The phone is far less likely to slip off the arm of the couch, (example) than it would be in most other cases. Another thing I really appreciate is the way the opening for the fingerprint sensor on the side is perfectly located and designed. Unlike other cases I tried, this case has a beveled opening, with very easy access to the sensor. With other cases, you have to stick your fingertip into a hole to access the sensor--not the case here. It is very well-designed. Look at the pictures of the opening on this case and others--this is the best design I've seen yet.<br /><br />So, $10 for a cheap case which is a hassle to put on and take off, and may not provide adequate protection (the last one I tried was terrible), or $30 for a high quality case which gets the job done properly and feels great in your hand, with plenty of protection and grip? It is your phone. You probably spent hundreds of dollars on it. Think about it.<br /><br />(Note this case does not include a screen protector, and I hate those anyway--they drive me bananas.)",

This case is made from rigid plastic which is too hard to provide much in the way of drop protection. Have you ever dropped your phone getting out of the car? I have, and the thought of dropping it in this case is terrifying. I returned it and purchased (yet another) Speck Presidio Grip case (3x the price), and my new phone is now protected properly in a one-piece case with a soft interior and a hard outer shell with rubber grip and corner bumpers. Most of the cases which meet this description are two separate pieces, and the Speck seems to be the only quality case which isn't (I have also tried Trident in the past, but the rubber in their case fell apart). A one-piece case is MUCH easier is you are taking it on and off all the time (see below).<br /><br />Also, it should be noted that due to the hard material this case is constructed from, it is not flexible, and getting it off the phone is a nightmare. I do not know why case manufacturers don't seem to understand this model of phone (Z3) uses Moto Mods. If you use Mods (which I do, all the time), you have to remove the case to attach them. Getting this case off is hard and it even feels a bit like the phone is in danger of bending in the process (scary!). This is just not a well-designed product, and it is not appropriate for either drop protection or daily use with this phone if you use Moto Mods (I use multiple Qi charging + extended battery mods).<br /><br />Also, this case provides no grip assistance and is actually quite slippery, as it is made from hard plastic.

Not like 3x faster or anything, but about 1.5x the speed of other Qi chargers--with the same power rating! Amazing. Bonus: it is also a night light, lighting up the room quite a bit with the blue light, which is more powerful/brighter than on any other Qi charger I have used.

Even just picking it up or slipping it into your pocket will cause the connection to break and it will stop charging. This was never a problem with the first one I had (Tumi--the same unit with a different skin, far more &quot;slippery&quot;). This moto mod arrived ever-so-slightly warped (curved/arced in the middle a tiny bit), and initially did not want to connect at all. Motorola offered to replace it, but as the unit had stopped displaying the behavior by the time I received their email reply, I decided to wait and not return it if I didn't need to--I was going to give it a chance to work. My mistake. The return window has now closed, and the device works properly less than half the time. I filed a warranty claim with Incipio, who has informed me they are no longer carrying this product (due to this issue--apparently this is a common problem). I'm sunk.

    "text": "I am very disappointed with this purchase. I had one like this without the ball joint, that did not move/articulate--just stayed in one place. It worked very well until after a couple of years the springs failed. I replaced it with this, thinking the ball joint would make it more useful, as it would move the phone about an inch closer to my fingertips and I could angle it as needed. In theory, this should have been a great car mount. In practice, it unfortunately fails, and here is why:<br /><br />The phone moves all over the place. If I tap the screen, my phone will tilt or turn. The ball joint is as tight as I can make it, and it still moves around a bit. However, the ball joint is not really the problem--the fingers that hold the entire thing into the vent are the problem. They do not grip the vanes in the vent strongly enough--it wiggles around all over the place. The ball joint will move a bit here and there, but really, it is movement at the connection to the vent point that is a problem. This was not a problem with the old one--the fingers of the vent holder were made of a grippier, rubber material than these. Simply put: these fingers slip, and the fingers on the one I replaced did not.<br /><br />I have ordered a replacement (another of the one I had before--$1.52 with free shipping--find it on here if you like), and it will take a month to get here from China, but it will be worth it. I plan on throwing this one away when the other arrives. I cannot recommend this item. Poorly executed. Needs grippier fingers to hold it in place.",

    "text": "*Updated review*<br /><br />Well, it has been 10 months, and I find myself wondering about the warranty, because it's shot. It has completely discolored and is yellowed. This, despite being hand washed, as directed, approximately once a month(ish). I tossed the packaging long ago, so have no warranty information. It is still protecting the phone as well as ever, and actually has not cracked or torn at all--seema very durable. Unfortunately, my phone looks terrible now in its vaguely urine-colored case. Needs replacing. Disappointed. :(<br /><br />---<br />Initial review in October 2016:<br /><br />This is exactly what I wanted for my Moto Droid Z Force. Well, almost--I wish there were a similar case that fit with the Tumi wireless charging battery Moto Mod installed, but apparently such a thing does not exist. Barring the invention of such an item (*arches eyebrow at Tumi*), this case is perfect. The screen is already shatterproof and does not require additional protection, so for the first time in years I do not need to have my phone in a huge (very effective) Otterbox Defender. What a nice change! I purchased this case because it was transparent and provided protection against scratches if I drop it. It fits perfectly, looks great, seems well made, provides much improved grip on the phone, and does exactly what I wanted it to do. The microdots inside keep the back from sticking to the phone, so it really does look good installed--very slick. Well, except for the fingerprints, but that's just the way it is--any clear case is going to show fingerprints. Nothing you can do about that other than clean it regularly, as you do with your phone's screen. Very happy thus far with this purchase. I do take it on and off daily though (so I can attach the Tumi mod--I don't leave it on because the mod doubles the phone's weight), and time will tell if it stands up to that sort of frequent on-off use (I sort of expect it to tear or crack at some point--when/if it does, I will update this review). $8 very well spent.",

    "title": "After initial warranty replacement (defective), the replacement died exactly one year later. Verdict: this case is NOT durable.",
    "text": "FINAL UPDATE:  The ridiculously good-looking white Trident Cyclops case for my Nokia Lumia Icon finally died--the silicone tore at both access ports (headphones, USB) simultaneously, and something had broken inside about a month ago, preventing it from fitting snugly so the screen protector was slightly elevated off the screen on the right side (annoying!). It lasted exactly one year from the day the warranty replacement arrived. Verdict: essentially junk. For the price (about $30 at the time), a phone case should last more than one year (note one year is also the warranty period on this case--aha...).<br /><br />Replacement is an Otterbox Defender (I know, I know--I should have started there), the first one I have ever had on a phone (I do have an Otterbox on my Kindle DX and have for ages). What a difference in build quality! The Otterbox is a vastly superior product--feels much more durable/rugged. I won't be throwing it off the roof any time soon, but I could see how the phone would survive in it. Best part: got it from a third-party seller on Amazon for $11, new. Happy camper.  Sorry Trident, but this product was just not well engineered. It is also worth noting that I have a Trident Aegis case on my smaller Kindle 3 (yes, I'm a gadget geek), and the silicone has torn on that too. Lesson learned: No more Trident products for me.<br /><br />---<br /><br />UPDATE:  Got the warranty replacement from Trident. They did fix the design and the camera button works normally now. However, and this may or may not have anything to do with the changes they made, the replacement case front piece (includes the screen protector) does not fit as snugly as before, and makes using it an exercise in frustration. Solution: I used the original front piece with the replacement back piece, and this mostly fixed the problem (although it is still not as tight to the screen as before). I sent Trident back the original (defective) back and the new front. I now have a case with a normally functioning camera button and a usable front screen protector.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Love the look and feel of this case. The built-in screen protector affects the sensitivity touch screen slightly--especially noticeable around the edges (frustrating at times). Although I hoped to receive the updated (corrected) design with my original order, my case had the known camera button defect. One press in camera mode produces 4+ photos. In the process of a warranty exchange with OEM (Trident) now. Definitely a PITA. Otherwise, like the case.<br /><br />Note: this case is thick enough that magnetic car mounts, even those that include additional metal plates you can install between the case and the phone, will NOT work. I bought and tried the Scoche Magic mount (http://www.amazon.com/SCOSCHE-MagicMount--Magnetic-Window-devices/dp/B00I608BHU), and returned it. :(<br /><br />Protection: seems very durable and well-made. I do not worry about dropping my phone in this case. An added plus, the camera lens is recessed into the case deeply enough to prevent most accidental fingerprints--awesome.",

For a year, I was completely satisfied with my purchase.  Just shy of one year, I needed a replacement for this item.  I contacted LorimaDirect and began a wonderful experience with a member of the company.  In less than a day, I received word that that I would receive a replacement free of charge.  That was on June 2, 2022.  I am happy to report that I received the replacement item on June 5, 2022.<br />That is blazing fast.  Three days from request to receiving the item!<br /><br />Lorima represents the BEST in customer service.  I was updated regularly on the progress of the replacement, and not by an auto-generated email, but by a real person.<br /><br />The replacement item has improved some of the features, making it even more durable and sturdy than it was.<br />I would strongly encourage that everyone READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!<br />It was only after receiving the replacement item that I realized that in order to fasten the actual phone holder plate to the unit that it needs to be snapped on and pushed down in order to lock it and prevent it from falling off the unit.<br />Secondly, I never realized that the bottom wing of the phone holder plate (where the USB cable goes through) is actually adjustable via a button on the back side of this plate.<br />Both of these features were available on my old unit, which I still have.  It is my own fault for not having read the instructions completely.<br /><br />I have to disagree with the majority of the negative reviews.  With the exception of those who received a defective unit, I believe that most, if not all the issues encountered could be remedied by either:<br />1) remembering to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, and/or<br />2) contacting customer service<br /><br />I am completely satisfied with the product.  It has all the features of those marketed by the larger companies, but for a very reasonable price.  I compared this item to those from other, larger companies prior to purchasing from LorimaDirect.  In my opinion, there is no reason to pay upwards of $60 or more for a cupholder from another company, when for substantially less, you get the same product with the same features.<br /><br />Definitely 5 STARS ALL AROUND !!!",

I was able to charge my phone faster with the USB-C vs the standard USB with this same plug. My wife and I both have iPhone 11s so I put hers on standard and mine on c. Mine charged about 50% faster. Neither of us used our phones during charging.<br /><br />I am not sure if the charging time is better overall with this plug but it doesn't seem to get incredibly hot like the standard plugs we've received in the past.<br /><br />Great product, definitely recommend",

This case fits like a glove and all of the buttons work perfect. It is not bulky which is nice since the 11 is a longer/larger phone that I didn't want issues with keeping it in my pocket. The slim fit definitely helps this issue.<br /><br />As far as the grip the back side and all around the backside corners seems to be more of a dense plastic whereas the sides soften up slightly with more of a silicone feel. This is fantastic because it definitely has helped with it already falling on tile floor once as it hit in the corner and fell face down.

The packaging was great and really helps keep the gimbal snug.<br /><br />There is a charging cord (no wall plug), tripod, instruction manual, quick start manual, and the gimbal.<br /><br />The gimbal does require an app to be downloaded, however once you've got that setup you don't need to keep it connected to the app as it still functions outside of the app.<br /><br />I did find that with dark backgrounds it has difficult tracking your face and can cause the gimbal to turn at random. This made it frustrating as my initial recording attempts had a solid background. Once I tried it elsewhere it was far better.<br /><br />PRO TIP: If using the record feature through the app, TURN PHONE VOLUME UP, otherwise the recording will be incredibly quiet.<br /><br />I let my 3 year old and 9 year old give it a try and they handled it well and it still followed them properly.<br /><br />The tripod works incredibly well to keep any vlogger looking like the real deal as it follows you left to right as well as moving up and down. Obviously you won't want to be doing sprint drills, but if you are looking for something to allow you to move around, this is your ticket! The battery charge time is about 1 hr and it lasted through my near 1 hour of testing (though I did stop the video a few times). You also have features on the hand grip to adjust through different tracking styles as well as starting and stopping recording as well as taking photos (while in the app these work). You can check out the MOZA app to see the versatility and many options for recording and adjusting how you record or take photos.<br /><br />My only downgrade was an issue I resolved on my own and may be for many other gimbals in that the dark background caused issues. Other than that I HIGHLY recommend this product.",

At the Verizon store where I purchased the phone a plain, bumper type holder was priced at nearly four times what this cost. Considering that those cases go for a few bucks here or other online sellers it's plain to see the value in this case.<br /><br />I did not rate this for durability because I have only had it for a week, but I am guessing that it will easily outlast the phone itself which (in my experience) dies before the contract runs out because of failures in fixed batteries.",

Many older vehicles do not have that port. If your vehicle lacks one, a better solution would be a bluetooth receiver that connects to your vehicle system using an FM radio signal.<br /><br />This is not limited to vehicle use. I am using mine to add bluetooth capability to a [[ASIN:B0077AMSNI Samson Expedition XP150 150-Watt Portable PA]], which has a 3.5mm input channel. I power this unit from a regular 1A USB power supply like those that come with most phones and tablets.<br /><br />Pairing and connecting from my Note 4 phone or Samsung tablet are easy. This goes into pairing mode when powered on, and I have not had any issues streaming music and backing tracks through it. I normally do not use the hands-free function, but I did test it and incoming and outgoing calls are clear and noise free.<br /><br />Bottom line: in my opinion, this is not as ideal as the FM solution I mentioned above for vehicles because of the need for a 3.5mm AUX port. However, for home stereo and on stage connections, this is perfect because even if your PA, amp or received only has RCA inputs, you can connect this device to them using an adapter such as [[ASIN:B000I23TTE C&E 30S1-01260 2 x RCA Male, 1 x 3.5mm Stereo Female, Y-Cable 6-Inch Gold Plated Connector]] or directly into the unit's AUX jack it it has one.

There are some detailed reviews that cover the physical and operational aspects so I am going to keep mine short.<br /><br />First, a recommendation: I would have this professionally installed. Yes, the kit that comes with it is more than complete and easy, but the nineteen foot AV cable is not a piece of cake to get into the dash or other mounting point. Also, it needs to be secured at intervals as you mount it to your vehicle's chassis (or interior). If you are handy at this, go for it, but trust me, if you are like me, it's well worth having it done.  Also, you will need to splice the power cable into your electrical system.<br /><br />Mounting the actual camera is easy. It holds its angle adjustment for normal street driving, and it definitely illuminates in the dark! Note, too, that you will need a monitor. I am using a [[ASIN:B01BECUNCC Pyle PLHR70 - Car rear view camera Monitor]] that works beautifully with this camera. Your total investment in hardware (camera and monitor) would come to around sixty bucks, and even if you have to pay an additional $120 or so for professional installation, you are still ahead compared to most packages, and definitely what a dealer would charge for an optional camera package on a new vehicle.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is one of the better back-up camera solutions I have used. I have owned a few, but this (and the monitor I cited) are the best combination that I have come across thus far.",

    "text": "I received this as a free review sample. My subtracted star is because the documentation is too small to adequately read. I am a fairly technical user who did not really need it, but for a non-technical person the mere act of finding the SIM slots, identifying which one to use, and how to insert the SIM card is daunting with the existing documentation. A large, single-sheet and well illustrated page would have gone a long way to making this a five star, consumer-friendly phone.<br /><br />Note: this is two versions of Android behind, but for me that is not a real issue. I am not sure if there is an upgrade path, but I do think that the KitKat version (4.4.2) that is on the phone is plenty functional for most people. The big surprise is how fast this phone is. I have been testing it for about a week with a T-Mobile card, and for web browsing where WiFi is available it is pretty close to my Note 4. YouTube video streaming is as smooth as it is on my Note 4, and other apps are just as fast. Bear in mind that I do not use apps that require fast processors, so if you are into game apps this phone may not be what you want.<br /><br />The camera for both photos and videos is pretty close to that on my Note 4 as well. The big difference between this and my [much more expensive] Note 4 is the Samsung can go a lot longer between battery charges. This phone is still decent in that area, but is nothing like the Note 4, so if you are a heavy user this aspect may be disappointing.<br /><br />Test calls were very clear in my area. I am in Central Florida and the area has excellent coverage for all of the major providers. Again, I would rate this as about on par with my Note 4 for making and receiving phone calls, but that is not exactly apples-to-apples since my Note 4 is on Verizon's 4G network and this phone is currently using T-Mobile's GSM service.<br /><br />This phone will accept micro SD cards up to 64GB, which does not completely meet my personal needs, but is probably more than enough for most people. The only other real issue other than the documentation shortcoming I mentioned above is the charging port on the phone requires a charging cable with a longer than normal micro USB end. The cable that ships with this phone has that end. If you want a spare, you can find cables that have that type of end, such as the [[ASIN:B00O7KPVEO Cellet Extra Long 8mm Tip Micro USB Charging/Data Sync Male Cable]].  I recommend purchasing one of those also.<br /><br />Basically this is a budget-priced smart phone that is approximately the same size as an iPhone 6 plus or Samsung Note series. It does not have the latest and greatest operating system or other features, but is still pretty fast and functional. For basic calling, web browsing, social networking and the such it is a great solution. For power users or folks who need (or want) the latest and greatest, this is probably not what you want.",

The operative word is 'new' because dead stands that are brown require a saw. These will also cut through brush and shrubs as fast and much easier than the other shears and trimmers I own, including long handle pruning shears.<br /><br />A final reason why I rated these so highly is the construction is first rate. I did notice a slight wobble where the pinned handles met, but the blade still seated perfectly into the channel in the opposite handle, and after using these for a full day the shears were still rock solid.  The handles are also nicely designed and easy to grip and operate for long periods - especially when cutting bamboo.<br /><br />Overall, these are well made and do a better job than other shears that I own or have used.

Take that into consideration when making a purchase decision. Where I live we use air conditioning almost year round, with some exceptions, so for most of the time this will work perfectly as a phone mount.<br /><br />Another thing to take into consideration: you can orient your phone from portrait to landscape, or any angle in between, but it cannot be tilted. In some vehicles that may be an impediment. Finally, I have not been using this long enough to determine of the powerful magnet is going to cause problems with my Note 4's S-pen, but will caution you to also take that into consideration.<br /><br />Bottom line: if this style of holder works for you, it's a safe bet that it will support your phone in most case types.",

    "text": "I purchased this because I wanted a rugged case for my Tab 4. I knew in advance that there was no screen protector, and did not want to spend a fortune. I was frankly surprised and pleased by the quality and level of protection that this case offers. In fact I would ALMOST put it on the same class as my OtterBox Defender cases that I am using on my Note 4 Phone and Tab Pro 8.4. It's not quite as good as those, but considering that this is a fourth of the price I would say it's a great deal.<br /><br />If there is one complaint, it's the lack of instructions. I had little trouble because I have installed the aforementioned OtterBox cases, which are as complex as this one. Had this been my first ruggedized case I probably would not be as enthusiastic considering how frustrating these cases can be for first time users. I did subtract a star for that reason.<br /><br />Here are a few features I do love. First, the raised lip around the screen does provide a lot of protection from face down falls (as long as it's a flat surface.) Second, all of the cutouts are precise and the buttons work a lot better than they do on my OtterBox cases, which are very finicky about alignment. This case is actually better in that regard. Finally, the case in no way interferes with screen real estate. I can access any part of the screen without interference.<br /><br />As for the stylus, I do not use them to begin with, so cannot comment on how well the one bundled with this case works. Same for the kickstand. I do not use those, so, again, cannot comment one way or the other.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a well made case that is almost as good as an OtterBox. Personally, I feel that this is one of my better purchases in recent months and am very pleased with it.",

Up front: this will NOT work with the larger Note 4 and 5 phones with an [[ASIN:B00NF4SXSO OtterBox Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Case Defender Series]]. Those cases and their similar competitors add too much additional bulk to the phone. That is not the fault of this armband bag because I tested some other cases, which work perfectly.<br /><br />The first case I tested - with a Note 5 - is the [[ASIN:B017IRCZEQ Note 5 Case,LBS [Vintage Classic Series] [Genuine Leather] Flip Cover Folio Case]]. Fit inside the bag with no tugging or other gymnastics. The second case, a [[ASIN:B0144MMRXM Galaxy Note 5 Battery Case, Bovon® 4200 mAh Ultra Slim Rechargeable Extended Charging Case Battery Pack Portable Backup Power Bank Case]], also fit with no issues.<br /><br />I also discovered that an iPhone 5S with a flip cover case would snugly fit into the smaller pocket, so if you have a smaller phone measuring no more than 5.25x3.25 inches with a case it will fit in the smaller pocket. For the larger pocket you can fit a phone - in case - measuring about 3.25x7.0 inches.<br /><br />The armband has elastic and velcro, which combine to give you a snug fit that is adjustable and comfortable. The construction is nicely made with strong zippers and water-repellent outer material with a thinly padded lining.<br /><br />Note that you should be using this case in conjunction with sports phones if you are going to use it for exercise. Removing and replacing the phone is a hassle if you are engaged in those endeavors. I tested it would with an inexpensive pair of  [[ASIN:B00RSUFT5G Bluetooth Earphones]] that allowed me to answer a test call as well as listen to music when I took this armband on a test walk around the block.",

This is as good as any I have used and actually better than some. If there is any difference, it's the clip and this one is more versatile than some I have used.<br /><br />First, while this is designed for the iPhone 5S it works with a lot of phones and tablets. I tested it with the iPhone, but also with a Galaxy Note 4, which is much larger, and it worked. The reason why I rated this so highly is the clip actually worked with the Note 4 while it was encased in an [[ASIN:B00NF4SXSO OtterBox Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Case Defender Series]]. That won me over.<br /><br />The fisheye and macro 15x lenses fit the clip. To use the wide angle lens it has to be piggy-backed off the macro lens.  The effects are undistorted (on the two phones with which I tested it), and the fisheye is a step above many I have used because it does not have the heavy circle that most such lenses impose on photos. The circle is there, but it's more subtle.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a truly versatile kit. Yes, there are others that are close (and even identical) and I would rate all them - competitors included - the same five stars because they are an inexpensive way to add decent effects to a phone.",

I am going to try not to repeat her thorough assessment and stick to a few things that I think set this apart.<br /><br />Foremost, this design is vastly different from the typical pouch style armband holders. That has pros and cons. On the pro side you can access any part of your screen without loss of sensitivity, as well as every button without a hassle. On the con side is in inclement weather or in harsh environments your phone is not protected against the elements. That can be remedied, though, by snapping the phone out of its holder and placing it in a more secure or protective area in the case of sudden rain, etc.<br /><br />Second, the case affords excellent protection. The lip of both the inner and outer shells are raised sufficiently to protect the screen. Although if you are not using a tempered glass screen protector you can still crack it if dropped in gravel. I know this from experience.<br /><br />Snapping the inner case out with the phone is a bit of a chore, but that also means that it's not going to jar loose during a jog or any other strenuous activity.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is different from any other activity-type armband case that I have used or tested for any model of phone. It's not for everyone, but if the pros I mentioned outweigh the cons for the way you plan to use it, this is worth considering. Personally I think it's superior for my uses, but that is something you have to decide for yourself.",

The cable itself is pliable, but sturdy.<br /><br />At first glance the strain reliefs look a little too stubby. In reality, however, they are more than sufficient because the cable length is just under eight inches, so the bend radius does not require longer reliefs.<br /><br />Regarding speed, I did not measure that aspect to validate total compliance with the product specs. I had no issues synching to my Note 3 phone by attaching its OEM charging and synching cable to the USB A end, which is a crucial test since Samsung phones are finicky about proper cables.<br /><br />What I love is if you have a lot of legacy USB A cables and peripherals and are now in an USB C connector world you can still use them because this is really an adapter. I tried a few random devices like a mouse, an old camera and an old USB 2.0 hub and this adapter cable supported all of them. It will kick down to USB 1.1.

That's because the top and bottom are open. The two sides have slight curves on the tops and bottoms that firmly hold the phone while protecting it.<br /><br />Basic protection is provided because the sides are slightly taller than the phone, and curve slightly inward to protect your screen in non-harsh environments like offices. This case will also accommodate your phone with one of the thicker glass screen protectors like the [[ASIN:B00BT8L2MW Tech Armor Apple iPhone 5/5c/5s Premium Ballistic Glass Screen Protector]]. In fact, that protector (or one of similar quality) will significantly raise the protection level of this case.<br /><br />One additional level of basic protection is provided by the flexible sides that will absorb some shock if you drop your phone.<br /><br />Overall, this is an inexpensive and attractive case that will protect your phone to a degree. Since I was provided with two cases with different schemes I tested both. I much prefer the clear sided model because it does not mask the white iPhone I have. If you own the grey model, the black sided model is probably better. Colors aside, this plus a glass screen protector combine to provide good protection without adding bulk or weight to your phone.",

It's so precise that I had to remove the front screen protector because the [[ASIN:B00OZ9VXU8 Zagg Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector]] that I also had installed would not allow the case to assemble until I did. The Zagg is super thin, so it shows just how close the tolerances are!<br /><br />All of the cutouts are also precise. The case does not hamper access to my S-Pen, and the charging and 3.5mm audio ports have tabs that seal them against water and dust. Frankly I do not need that level or protection, but if you work in harsh environments those are nice features.<br /><br />Installation is straightforward and easy. I had mine completely installed in about five minutes despite a little initial confusion from the storyboard part of the instructions. There are two steps in the procedure that do require attention: aligning the covers for the volume and power buttons. Those took mere seconds, but on the first attempt I did not have them properly seated.<br /><br />The way the rim around the screen is beveled and how it recesses the screen is a nice level of protection. I am guessing that the included screen protector is effective, but since I removed that so accommodate my Zagg glass protector I cannot say one way or the other.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a little on the bulky side, but is possibly the best protection there is.

The protector itself was also none the worse for the wear, so not only am I lucky, but this turned out to be an investment that saved me from my own clumsiness. If you've ever dropped a phone and cracked the screen you will understand what I am talking about.<br /><br />While I did not personally installed it I watched the technician while it was being done. It's a simple process as long as you take care and do not rush through it. I read the instructions later and he followed them to the letter. Granted, the guy who installed it probably has done hundreds of these things, but the guide tabs made it look foolproof.<br /><br />There are no sensitivity issues. I use my finger way more than the S-pen and this screen did not hamper any action even to the very edge of the screen. Personally I am sold and am going to purchase (and install myself) this protector on my tablets.<br /><br />Registering it on the Zagg site was quick and did not require a proof of purchase. Hopefully I will never have to test their guarantee for the shield, but it's nice to know that there is some level of additional assurance.<br /><br />Two parting notes: (1) the price at the time of this review is less than half what I paid for mine at the Verizon store.

What it is, though, is a fun set of lenses that give you some interesting choices when using your phone or tablet for stills and even video.<br /><br />There are a few things that you need to know so you are not disappointed. Placing the lens holder over you device's camera lens needs to be precise. If you do not take the time to perfectly align them you will get a shadow or even a partial photo. Also, if your device's flash gets partially covered you will get some ruined shots as well. That is the price you pay for a universal fit that will accommodate most phones and tablets.<br /><br />This set fit my Samsung Note 3 phone, as well as both my Tab 3 10.1 and Tab Pro 12.2 tablets. The jaws of the clamp open a full 1/4 inch, so the claim that it will work with most covers is accurate. Some of the hardened cases may be a problem, but my thick, leather case was not a problem at all. You can also reach any device lens that is 11/16 of an inch or less from the device's edge, so this kit should work with 99% of the phones and tablets currently on the market.<br /><br />Each of the effects were as good as any of other universal lens kits that I have used. The fisheye was nothing special, but it worked as well as any. I like the macro lens the most because I was able to capture small details with the entire object and background in focus. My phone's camera gets a lot of credit for that, but the clip on lens consistently produced clear photos with decent detail. The wide angle piggy backs onto the macro lens, so when you open the package you are not being shortchanged - the third lens is screwed into the macro.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an inexpensive way to add some interesting effects and capabilities to your device's internal camera. There are some tradeoffs, and you do need to take some care in how you position the lenses, but when you have them aligned (without hampering with the flash) the results are impressive.",

Lebryk's June 10, 2015 covers this light in depth and I will attempt to avoid repeating his helpful information.<br /><br />This is not my first lightweight DMX style light, but it's the first that I have owned and used that is sound activated. The sound activation is a little tricky. It only responds to low frequeny signals, so unless you have subs or are biasing your mix heavily towards bass this light may not respond to sound. For the music I play it does not work, but I will guess that if you are a DJ or running heavy bass music it's a feature you will love. Of course this has DMX in and out connectors, so you can daisy-chain this light off of a controller.<br /><br />For folks like myself who use minimal effects with no DMX controller the back panel is an effective way to set your displays. Be aware that with the combinations and permutations of lighting styles and the 255 steps each for the Red,Green and Blue combinations it can be time consuming to set up. Especially when you have a single step up/down key to get to the settings. Fortunately you can stick with the program and mode features and get some attractive, basic displays, which is how I use this light. If you do decide to use a DMX controller and do not yet own one a good starter controller is the [[ASIN:B004STXY3E American Dj Supply RGB3C RGB Led Controller With Built In Colors And Shows]]. It's overkill for a single light, but if you are planning to purchase more than one of these lights it will greatly simplify setting them up and managing them.<br /><br />It comes with a bail that allows you to hang it or use it as a floor stand. Since this is a fairly lightweight and cool running light it is not going to overheat for shows up to five hours, nor will it or even a dozen of them, contribute to stage temperatures. I love that characteristic.<br /><br />One note about the UK style plug and the US style adapter: then I plug in or unplug I observed sparking. That is a concern and a reason why I subtracted a star. The culprit may be the adapter itself and not the light, but I did not have a spare laying around to confirm that. Since safety is paramount I need to highlight this as a potential issue that you should factor in when making a purchase decision.",

The latter is actually functional because it's practically non-slip and provides for a tough exterior. Since I am somewhat sight challenges I personally like the bright red trim that makes this easy to spot. All black cases seem to blend into my piles of other stuff and hide right under my nose, so I do view the color scheme as a feature.<br /><br />If you own any of the phone models with which this will work it's an inexpensive way to protect them.",

    "text": "I received this as a free review sample along with a more luxurious model. I am going to make a comparison between the two since they are the same brand. The other case is the [[ASIN:B00SKKHY4C Smartphone zipper wallet case, Belfen® [Handmade genuine leather] [Gray]Zipper Wallet Case]]. The dimensions of both are identical, but this one is a lighter duty case (in my opinion) and the outer finish appears to be a thin layer of genuine leather over a synthetic backing. That is not a criticism as much as an observation. The higher end case I mentioned has a better finish and construction.<br /><br />This will easily hold my Note 3 phone, which is fairly large. The pockets and holders provide a lot of space and this can be used to downsize from a full purse without having to give up room for essentials. I was able to fit my phone encased in a [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion Genuine Lambskin Folio Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3]] and have room to spare. I am not sure some of the more ruggedized cases will fit and did not one on hand to try. It will hold my phone and case, and an array of credit and ID cards, case and a small notepad with no issues. In fact there was room to spare after I tested it with those items.<br /><br />When you first unpack it there is a slight chemical odor, but it quickly goes away. Unlike the premium case I mentioned above the outer covering also had that odor, which is why I suspect it's a thin piece of real leather over a synthetic backing. Considering the much lower price of this case that makes sense. I do love the non-slip textured surface of this one over the premium case's surface, and most of the construction of this one is identical to the premium case: heavy-duty zipper affixed to a reinforced cloth that is, in turn, sandwiched between the outer leather and the synthetic interior parts. The inside zipper is lighter duty and this case has no wrist strap.<br /><br />Although this is a budget model compared to the other one this brand offers it's sturdy, roomy and very functional. It's also attractive and I would have no problem giving it as a gift. The women to whom I've shown it all said they liked it (a few loved it), and that is another reason why I gave it a high rating.",

I first thought it was because the outer finish was synthetic leather, but a sniff test indicated that the inner dividers and compartments were the culprits. The outer appears to be genuine, fine leather, although I am not sure if it's a thin layer over another material. Regardless, it's gorgeous and looks like the real thing down to the pores in the leather other natural imperfections that fine leather has.<br /><br />The inner compartments are roomy. As important they are nicely organized and if you are a woman who wants to ditch a heavy purse without compromising the space to carry an array of credit and ID cards, and other small items this is perfect. It easily holds my Note 3 phone, which is pretty large without a case as well as in a thin case like the [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion Genuine Lambskin Folio Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3]]. I was able to also fit the phone - inside a  [[ASIN:B00GOHUNO6 Fliptroniks Galaxy Note 3 Brown Real Leather Wallet Flip Case]] - in the middle compartment,  but could not add anything else and had a hard time zipping it. Of course, I expected that result because the Fliptroniks case is large and thick and has pockets itself.<br /><br />Construction is first rate. The heavy-duty zipper is affixed to a reinforced cloth that is, in turn, sandwiched between the thick outer leather and the synthetic interior parts. Even the metal loop to which the carry strap clips is well made and firmly affixed to the case itself.<br /><br />Finally, the outer part has multiple strips of leather that are used for both aesthetics and reinforcement, making this both attractive and rugged.

This one is biased towards the mid range - and in a wide frequency band that reaches a little into the highs and lows. The high end is nice and full, and the bass is the same. The bass is not in-your-face, but it's respectable, even with modern, bass-centric music.<br /><br />Volume is decent, but this is a speaker that you will want no farther away than two meters and preferably one. That range is perfect for a night stand or desk.<br /><br />The subtracted star is for spotty bluetooth range. Normally I am near this speaker, but if I am on the phone and wander even a few meters away the sound quality can take a dive. I am guessing that the receiver is either extra shielded by foil internally, or the heavy metal case is the culprit. Regardless, it's a limitation for folks who tend to wander away from the speaker.<br /><br />Pairing and connecting are a snap, so that is yet another reason why I still rated it so highly, and I did get five and a half solid hours of continuous play with the speaker cranked to max.

I personally tested it as a battery backup for my Note 3 phone, and my sister-in-law used it to jump start her motorcycle.<br /><br />Frankly I was not surprised that this jump started a motorcycle because I used a similar product to jump start a car a few months ago. What does surprise me is the speed this recharges my Note 3 phone with its 3300mAh battery. When I am using a fast wall charger I can get a charging rate of 1% per 2.5 minutes. This battery was only five seconds longer per percent, which beats most wall chargers and every other battery I have ever tested. In fact, that is one of the primary reasons why I awarded this kit five stars.<br /><br />Another reason why I rated this so highly is it comes in a well organized, zippered case that stores in the center console (or the glove box) of my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander. While I am not crazy about the non-standard barrel connector chargers (I would have preferred standard USB styles), I understand the reason for them because this battery requires a 14 volt charging source versus the  5 volt one common to USB devices. At lease this includes both a wall and car charger.<br /><br />One final note: this is rated at - and does store - 8000mAh of juice. However for charging phones and tablets do not expect more than 5600mAh, which is still respectable. The reason is all batteries using this technology lose 16% of the capacity from heat and the actual transfer process and another 14% from the charging cable itself. Factor that in if you intend to use this as a device backup as well as a jump starter. For me I have other batteries for my phone and tablets, so this one sits in my car ready for that inevitable time when I forgot to turn off my lights and need to  be somewhere in a hurry.",

If you are comparison shopping keep in mind tnat there are more than one type of these on the market even though they all look similar.<br /><br />Personally I am not a selfie sort of person (if you saw a clear photo of my face you'd know why). Where this excels for me is it's ideal for steadying my camera on tables, balcony rails and other spots. This allows me to take some great photos. Of course, it certainly works for selfies, but is ideal for taking steady shots of panoramic views and close ups of smaller objects. If you use your camera for a lot of photography or videos this is actually an essential accessory.<br /><br />When you first unbox this and set it up the top hook seems to be fixed, but is actually a spring loaded grabber arm.

I have been using my review sample for a week and generally like it.<br /><br />One reason for the five stars is the fact that this is both a speaker and a battery backup. Another reason is the sound quality is not only respectable, but this one can crank up a little louder than most bluetooth speakers in its class. Of course, having the ability to play back from memory cards is a plus for me since I have a huge music library than is stored on that type of media.<br /><br />Note that some of the features are hidden bu a fabric (and elastic) band around the top of the speaker housing. This band is really a carrying strap, and out of the box you will not immediately see the TF card slot and charging ports, The instructions are the weak point and make no mention of this.<br /><br />Sound is fairly even and continuous across the three major frequency bands. The highs seamlessly blend into the mid range, which, in turn, blend into the low end. And the lows are not wimpy. With the volume cranked this is more than a personal speaker - it can  be clearly heard from six plus meters away. Moreover, the high end does not break up when this is cranked to the maximum setting.<br /><br />As for the battery back-up, this unit will store the full 8000mAh, but do not expect more than 5600mAh of back up from it. This is because all batteries using this technology lose 16% of the stored power from heat and the transfer process, and another 14% from cable inefficiencies. On the other hand even the 5600mAh will more than double the use time of most smart phones and substantially boost the use time of tablets, so that feature is valuable.<br /><br />Overall this is a great speaker for camping, outings and for road warriors who spend too much time in airports and hotels. It has a lot of features packed into a relatively small form factor, and those features actually work better than most speakers (and battery back ups) that I have tested.",

The swivel ball assembly and compression nut are difficult to tighten because of the size of the clamp. You can sufficiently tighten them, but it takes some time.

Do be aware that while the charger itself is not particularly large (see the product specs for the dimensions), the amount of space taken up by phones, tablets and various devices is significant. My new charging area in which the review sample that I received is the centerpiece, is 4x2 feet and cable management is also a necessity. I am mentioning this because while this is a godsend for we gadget junkies, there are factors that you need to consider and space is at the top of the list.<br /><br />Since others have done a good job of reciting specs I'll avoid adding to that. There are some things that I love about this charger, and some things that you need to know.<br /><br />First, to set expectations, if you fully load this charger expect no more than 1.2 Amps per port. I know that the description says up to 2.4 Amps per port, but at 60 Watts total there are only 12 Amps total capacity. That means that you can get the full 2.4 Amps per port, but for only five of the ports simultaneously. Since the controller detects charging requirements, loading all ten ports with high current devices will drop all of them down to 1.1 Amps each. So if you have five tablets and want to charge them at 2 Amps each you can support two additional 1 Amp devices. Or if you have five 2.4 Amp devices, that is the max you can charge at the highest claimed charging rate.<br /><br />The above numbers are not as bad as they seem. I have three tablets, two phones and a plethora of speakers and other devices and this charger handles that gaggle of electronics at their max charging rates. My main test is to determine the fastest rate for a single port. I use a Galaxy Note 3 with a 3300mAh internal battery and the best time it gets from another wall charger I use. On the other charger the Note 3 charges 1% per 2.5 minutes. On this charger - with no other devices plugged in - the Note 3 charges in 2.8 minutes, which is a 28 second difference. For me that is an excellent number because I have other chargers that claim to be fast that take from over three up to six minutes to charge the phone 1%.<br /><br />As others have mentioned this charger is both quiet and runs cool. I have no qualms about leaving it in another room charging my gadgets overnight. Contrast that with other multi-port chargers that I have tested that run very hot when fully loaded. I always worry about fire and safety issues with those, so the running parameters of this one are yet another reason why I awarded it five stars.",

As for the physical characteristics I fully agree with  B. Nguyen Tech Reviewer's October 12, 2014 review. The cable is practically tangle-free.<br /><br />I tested this with a few audio devices connected to the Aux port on my [[ASIN:B0035EHLZK Roland KC-110 3-Channel 30-Watt Stereo Mixing Keyboard Amplifier]]. Direct connects were absolutely noise free (I tested with a Galaxy Note 3 phone and Samsung Tab 3 10.1 tablet). I also tested a bluetooth received that I connected to the Aux port and streamed music from my Note 3. Again, noise-free. Also, there is no handling noise, which I also tested.<br /><br />In addition to a tangle free cable that is a full meter long, this also sports some beefy strain reliefs on each end. I have not owned this cable long enough to determine sturdiness, especially from the large amount of handling it will receive as I use it on gigs, If it does prematurely fail or becomes noisy from excessive handling I will update this review to reflect that. In the mean time it earns a solid five stars.",

    "title": "Excellent protection. Can be used by either gender, but more suitable for women",
    "text": "This case can both protect your phone and double as a wallet. In fact, for women, it can double as a small purse because it has grommets on each end of the spline to hook in the included strap. More about that below.<br /><br />From a protection perspective this depends mainly on the inner plastic holder into which you snap your phone and the relatively stiff back and front cover. Also, the magnetic flap will keep the case in the closed position (assuming was was already closed and fastened) should you drop your phone. While there is little padding, the thickness of the outer case will still reduce shock. Regarding the magnetic flap, I tested that by first dropping it (empty, of course) on the floor and it held. I then literally threw it on the floor a few times, each with increasing force. The third time it popped open.<br /><br />Functionally, the cutouts for buttons, camera and other functions are precision cut. Plus the phone snapped into the hard, protective holder and stayed. I had to do a little prying to remove it, but that is not an issue for me. I actually appreciate the fact that if I were to drop the phone it's not going to pop out of the holder. Been there and done that with a different phone and case.<br /><br />The window style holder for a picture ID is a little short for my Florida driver's license, but it held it like a pocket. I would still have to remove it if I need to show ID to a TSA agent or other individual needing to see it. The credit card holders accommodated three cards without increasing the bulk of the case substantially, and the wallet holder will easily hold five bills of currency before it starts to bulk up.<br /><br />My review sample came with a faux leather strap with quick release fasteners on each end. They are designed to snap into the grommets on each end of the spline and function as a handle. The overall length is a little over 13.5 inches. This is more suitable for women, but without the strap this is easily a case that either gender can use. The 'leather' is actually a synthetic material. There is a very slight chemical odor when you first unbox it, but that goes away in less than thirty minutes. The important thing is no animal died and it's easy to wire clean if needed. Interestingly it can pass for real leather.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you've shopped for a decent case - even at that big box store - you know how pricy a good one can be. This is reasonably priced, well made and very functional.",

    "text": "I recently upgraded one of the phones on my plan to an S5, so when I was offered a review sample of this screen protector I accepted. I know, firsthand, that these tempered glass protectors work because I have one on my Note 3 and when I dropped it and it looked like my screen cracked it turns out it was the protective glass. The screen was unaffected. That glass was a different brand, but nearly identical to this one. And, no, I am not going to drop test this one to see.<br /><br />Installation is relatively simple and straightforward. You do need a steady hand and a good eye, but as importantly, you need to get your phone's screen as clean as possible. You can use the included alcohol swab, but I picked up a trick from a Verizon employee that ensures that it's clean: after swabbing down, let the screen dry, Then take some cellophane tape and lay the sticky side on the screen, then pick up and move to another spot. Repeat until the entire surface has been cleaned that way (and I recommend repeating again to make sure.) The kit includes a 'dust sticker' that works like the cellophane tape I mentioned, but I found the tape to be more effective.<br /><br />Once the screen is clean, peel back a little of the mask on the protector, line up with the screen and apply. Peel back the mask as you lay down the screen. If you have misaligned you can lift and reapply the screen, but that step needs to be done fairly quickly. The final step is to brush out the air bubbles. I used a plastic ruler's edge and a little (not much) pressure. I went vertically, then horizontally, and repeated. From there the screen looked like part of the phone.<br /><br />This protective screen is as sensitive as the screen on the phone. After it was installed my phone reacted to touch the exact same way it did before this protector was applied, and there is no real visual difference either. One final thing: the phone fit in it's case exactly as before the protector was put on. Bottom line: this is probably the best single thing you can get for a new phone. My experience with a different brand of a similar product convinced me.",

    "text": "Like the previous reviewer I received a four pack as a review sample. My first test of any USB cable is to see if it will support synching between my laptop and my Samsung Note 3 and Tab 3 10.1. Both of those are finicky when it comes to synching, although neither seems to care about cable quality when it comes to charging.<br /><br />Both devices synched and supported file transfers to and from an old ThinkPad T61<br /><br />Another test to which I put micro USB cables is to check the fit on my Note 3, which has a charging and synching port based on USB 3.0. USB 2.0 micro cables can be plugged into the right side of the port and perform both charging and synching, although the synching is at a lower speed. Some cables I have used were too tight a fit to that port and I could not use them for even charging. This one fit as though it was made for it. So, it passed another test.<br /><br />Finally, the cable has strain reliefs on each end, although the micro end looks a little small. Time will tell on that one. The insulating outer cover is shiny and the cable is a little stiffer than most. I am not sure why or what pros or cons it carries. For now I am giving this set five stars for the reasons mentioned above. If I experience premature failure I'll update this review accordingly. In the mean time these will get a workout because I already have two in chargers and two in my car for spares.",

    "text": "The review sample that I received quickly became my favorite charger. I am fickle so 'favorite' is subject to change, but for the time being it is the one I use all of the time. Here are a few reasons why:<br /><br />First off, I do not have to worry about which device goes into which port. Nearly every other charger that I have owned and tested work best if a particular device like an Apple of Samsung is plugged into a port designed for it. To be sure, even those chargers will charge regardless of which port is used, but with less than perfect results. This one will detect and adapt the charging rate regardless of the device.<br /><br />Second, I love the 4.5 foot cable that ships with this. Wall chargers that plug directly into outlets have their place, but my living room is open and wall outlets are never where I need them. The cable allows me a lot of flexibility. Plus, since the cable is a detachable figure eight style I can purchase a longer one from even my local CVS is I need more length.<br /><br />Finally, the ability to charge five devices at 2 Amps per port (or four devices at 2.4 Amps) simultaneously is a big plus. I own two tablets and two smart phones and they charge very quickly off this charger, In fact, even my slowest charging device - the iPad 2 - charges 2 percent per minute, which is a speed record for it.<br /><br />I could go on, but I would only be repeating other reviews and product specs. The above reasons inspired me to award this five stars and while I normally donate my review samples I am keeping this one.",

Before I go too deeply into that experience I'll describe this light.<br /><br />It's basically a small, bright flashlight that runs off or an internal battery that charges from a standard 5V wall of car charger. Although it has a 3.5mm connector, that does not provide electrical signals - it's a convenient way to mount the light on devices that have a 3.5mm port.<br /><br />There is an optional mount adapter that is designed for iPhones, but I clipped it on to my Galaxy Note 3 and it worked. This is where the confusion lies because it ships with the light inserted into that mount's rail. In the absence of real instructions I had no idea how to make it work. This product page contained the real clues, and I finally figured it out by coming here. Had I given this as a gift it would have confused the recipient, and that is why I gave it four stars.<br /><br />The lights are bright and this will make a big difference if you are using your phone for photography. Or you can slip it from the iPhone mount and use it as a pocket flashlight. In that role it's super bright and does an excellent job of illuminating. It also works perfectly as a workbench light for close, detailed work or inspection (I restore vintage fountain pens and it's ideal for that.)<br /><br />Bottom line: the only thing standing in the way of a five star rating is better instructions. This is a versatile and effective light and with those instructions you can be using it immediately out of the box.",

I received mine as a review sample and just had to see if it would hold my Galaxy Note 3 - it would not. Of course I was just checking since this is not claimed to be compatible with such big phones.<br /><br />It worked beautifully with an HTC Droid Incredible, and I briefly enlisted a friend's help to check her iPhone 5S, which also works with it.<br /><br />The design is clever in that it uses a magnet that can either go between the back of your phone and a bumper-style case, or the second one that has an adhesive backing that attaches directly to phones and cases. The magnet holds the phone firmly in place, even when driving over bumpy terrain. It's easy to remove your phone by using an up, down or lateral sliding motion.<br /><br />The suction cup worked on my vehicle's textured dash, and the holder was able to accommodate a decent viewing angle for either driver or passenger (depending on where it's placed on the dash.) One of my favorite features is how small this is folded down when not in use. It actually looks like an integral part of my dashboard.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you have a smaller, lighter phone this is a nice holder that is both unobtrusive and functional.",

    "text": "When my review sample arrived I put it through a few tests to make sure that it is a viable replacement for a genuine Samsung battery. The first thing I noted, though, is the battery had a marking claiming that it was NFC (near field communications) enabled. I was a bit puzzled because my Note 3 is already enabled. A little research turned up the fact that this battery has an NFC antenna built into it that works with the NFC circuit and software in my phone. I tested this out with an NFC-enabled speaker and the new battery worked like the OEM one.<br /><br />The next test was to see if it would fully charge. It did. Other batteries that I have tested with my Note 3 would charge to 99%, then hover there forever. I discharged the battery down to 90% two additional times and recharged it to make sure this battery did not have memory effect issues. Each time the percentages, including the fully charged 100%, displayed accurately. It you are wondering what memory effect is, it's the erroneous detection and display of the actual capacity by your phone's battery management.<br /><br />This battery passed every test I put it through and more importantly I did not receive any complaints from my phone about an incompatible battery (that happened with another third party battery I tested about six months ago).<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are shopping for a good replacement battery and do not want to pay the outrageous prices carriers charge, this is a safe bet. It is as good as the one Samsung makes in my opinion. In fact, it's in my phone right now and will remain there. If problems do arise I will revise this review accordingly.",

I will avoid repeating the physical characteristics and provide my own observations and experiences with the review sample that I received.<br /><br />This battery pack has the capacity to satisfy most power users who are glued to their phone. It will also provide a respectable margin of additional use time for the true geeks who are constantly glued to both a smart phone and a tablet. For that breed of power user even the 10400mAh capacity this provides may not be enough, but for ninety-nine percent of us this is more than ample.<br /><br />Before proceeding I want to disclose that I always multiply new battery packs by .9 to get a more realistic capacity. That's because there are some losses in efficiency from heat, the transfer process, condition of your charging cable and myriad other factors. Using my quick formula you can expect about 9360mAh from this battery.<br /><br />Even at the readjusted capacity you can expect some significant increases in use time. An Apple iPhone 5S with a stock 1560mAh battery will get an additional six hundred percent of use time attached to this. An iPad 2 with a stock 6930mAh battery will get slightly more than double its normal use time. Of course plugging two devices into this battery will alter the effective use time increases, but some very simple math will let you forecast how much.<br /><br />I tested this with a few devices, including an iPhone 5S, iPad 2, Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Samsung Tab 3 10.1. In all cases I connected two devices simultaneously (Apples first, then the Samsungs) and the charging rate from this battery was slightly less than if I plugged each device individually into their respective OEM wall chargers. That's actually pretty impressive.<br /><br />Note that the instructions claim that you can charge this battery from a PC's USB port. I tried that on my ThinkPad T61 and it was extremely show compared to one of my Samsung wall chargers to which I connected it. This is more of a problem with my ThinkPad than the battery, but I wanted to point that out to set expectations.<br /><br />Bottom line: this battery pack is solid, reliable and has more than enough capacity for all but true power users. Mine is actually connected to the tablet on which I am writing this review - I trust it that much.",

It apparently likes this cable, which means that I do as well.<br /><br />I love the indicator light that shows when you are charging (red) as well as when your device is at one hundred percent (blue). The micro USB end fit my phone's [[ASIN:B00GOHUNO6 Fliptroniks Chocolate Panther Leather Wallet Case]], but could be a problem with some phone cases.

However, for most of us, even with S-pen models, this is not an issue because I use the driving interface in my car. I mention this to set expectations because it's not a flaw in the design.<br /><br />My Galaxy Note 3 is a little too big for this holder. Actually, it's more heavy than big because the holder is practically size-independent. It still works, but I worry about the magnet slipping. It is perfect for an iPhone 5S, though, and both the dash/windshield mount and the CD player mount work with the lighter phones like a charm.<br /><br />I love the 360 degree positioning. You can set either the base or CD mount to any viewing angle. The suction cup on the base mounting system clung to the textured surface of the dash on my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander and held firmly even with the full weight of the iPhone 5S. It did not leave any ugly residue behind, and it attached to my windshield in the same firm manner.  My favorite option is the CD player attachment which places the phone exactly where I want it. I use bluetooth streaming in my car for music, so the only use I get from the CD player is using the slot for the holder.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a nice system that gives you two mounting options and works well with a lot of phones.

First, please read and heed Comdet's helpful April 6, 2014 review because some of the limitation cited are valid if you have a phone the size of a Samsung Galaxy Note II or larger. For iPhones or phones of similar size this holder does work well.<br /><br />My test with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 indicates that not only is this a tight fit, but getting the phone into the jaws of the clamp was an exercise in frustration. Like Comdet mentioned, when I had the clamps at the last adjustment stop, opening the spring loaded jaw further to fit the Note 3 would disengage the jaw from the adjustment stop. If you remember what flypaper is, this cycle of events is akin to unsticking that stuff. The more you tried, the more frustrating it is.<br /><br />On the other hand, an iPhone 5S fit the clamp as though they were designed for each other and this product was transformed from a mechanical demon to an absolute joy to use. Among the reasons why it was a joy with the smaller phones are the protective strips on the sides of the clamp (the blue areas in the photos) that ensure your phone will not be marred or scratched. Another reason why I love this for the smaller phones is the suction cup holds strongly, even on the pebble-grained dashboard in my vehicle. And finally, the ability to swivel the phone to just about any conceivable angle adds a lot of convenience.  Some holders that I have tested were limited in viewing angle, so this one is a step ahead of that group.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you own a phone the size of a Note II or Note 3, look elsewhere because while this one will work, it's too much trouble in my opinion.

The two suction cup design is clever because it gives me not only more flexibility than other holds provide, but also a margin of safety. If one cup were to fail for any reason the other is strong enough to keep your precious phone or small tablet from becoming a projectile.<br /><br />The package ships with two holders - one for small tablets up to seven inches, and a smaller one for phones. The smaller one is the one that fits my Note 3. Both have spring loaded grabber arms that firmly hold your phone or tablet. There is a thin, soft film on the inside of the arms, but not on the part that contacts the back of your tablet or phone.<br /><br />There are two types of suction cups employed in the design. The base cup uses a lever to actuate a vacuum and it holds tightly to most surfaces. I tries nit out on my pebble-grained dashboard in my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander and it gripped the surface like it became a part of it. That cup, though, was designed for the windshield, with the second cup designed to hold the flexible gooseneck stable from an attach point on your dashboard. It, too, held that surface firmly and made a big difference in stabilizing and supporting my Note 3.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have no tablets smaller than 10.1 inches, so was unable to test the larger holder. From the rock solid way the assembly held my Note 3, though, I have no doubt it will easily support any seven inch tablet on the market.<br /><br />Of all of the mounts that I have tested this one is a paragon of design, engineering and construction.

Of the eight other ones I own all have slots that are 2.25 inches wide; this has slots that are 2 7/8 inches wide, so it's more versatile with respect to what I can store in this area of the case. The billfold area is correspondingly longer as well, which is handy if you are in or traveling to countries that use wider paper currency.<br /><br />However, what it most important to me is the protection that this case affords. I am going to directly compare this to the case I was using before this one arrived: a [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion for Galaxy Note 3 - 100% Genuine Lambskin Folio Case]]. Both have precision cutouts for buttons, camera flash and even the same style hard plastic retainer part that firmly holds the Note 3 in place.  Here is where this case leaves that one in the dust:<br /><br />- Thicker Leather: this one has an outer and inner layer of leather on the front that provides a lot more padding and protection than the Bear Motion model. Of course this one is priced significantly higher than that one, so I am not questioning the basic value of the Bear Motion. It's just that I think this one is worth the premium price for the protection alone.<br /><br />- Heavier Fastener: the fastener on the Bear Motion model out after about six months of use. It was a fairly thin piece of leather. The fastener on this case is two layers of stitched leather that is thicker and stronger. I did extensively test this with the S-Pen and there is no interference from the magnetic closure. The magnet used is relatively weak. More about that below,<br /><br />- Back Side Protects: most of the cases I own have thicker fronts with the lack of the case thinner and less protective. This one has a thicker back side that provides more protection than any other case I own for the Note 3.<br /><br />There is one potentially weak spot and that is the way the magnetic fastener closes. It holds, but I am not sure it would stay shut and totally protect the phone by holding the front cover in place if I dropped it and it bounced. And frankly I just do not have the courage to do a drop test with my Note 3. The trade-off here is the convenience of a magnetic fastener without interfering with the S-Pen. I know that the snap style fasteners quickly wear out - that is evident on the Bear Motion case to which I am comparing this.<br /><br />The fact that this will be my Note 3's case going forward (unless something even better comes along) says it all. I love the looks, feel and the assurance that I have superb protection. Personally this one is worth every penny of the premium price and has already elicited compliments.",

    "text": "I just had to test this with a Note II and 3 even though the review sample I received did not list them as compatible. The Note II fit, albeit too tightly to be useful, and the Note 3 was a millimeter or two too wide.<br /><br />For the Note II I was able to perform any task or function that did not involve the S-pen (as expected) or take clear photos. Surprisingly the screen responded to my touches and swipes through the cover as though the phone was not encased in it. Conversations are a bit muffled though (I had to test that function too.)<br /><br />Using this is easy. There are two snaps that tightly seal the top of the case. Unsnap those, insert your phone, realign the sealed halves and close the snaps. I did not have the occasion to test the IPX8 certification claim of the ability to protect the phone to 100 feet submerged. I did submerge the case filled with tissue in a sink and it kept it bone dry. Not a very scientific test, but I had to know.<br /><br />While I am not sure why anyone would want to go diving with their phone, this case is perfect for emergency responders and others who work in harsh, wet environments and want maximum protection against water (or dust) damage. In that respect this is a great investment in protection that normal cases just won't provide.,",

It may seem like an easy thing to accomplish, but judging from other cases that I have tested and reviewed for the iPhone 5S it apparently isn't.<br /><br />The fit of this case, including access to buttons, ports and features is perfect. What I love is the case, which is made from thermoplastic polyurethane and does, indeed, absorb shocks. In fact I wish I could find such a case for my Galaxy Note 3 phone.<br /><br />As for the claim that this is 'crystal clear' all I can say is it's so transparent that it does not look like you have a case protecting your phone. The advantage is not just the look, but the fact that this case does not appreciably add to the size of your phone, and the weight difference is nominal.<br /><br />One final thing that I love about this case is the lip that goes around it us slightly curved inward. It's slightly raised above the screen, so your phone may survive a fall on a flat surface.<br /><br />If there is a single improvement that I would like to see it's a slightly enlarged cutout for the charging cable. This perfectly fits Apple's OEM cable, but there are some aftermarket cables that are a tad too large to properly seat. Of course, that is the fault of the cable manufacturer and not this case, which is perfect for genuine Apple parts.",

By that I mean that if you plug a device into it and the corresponding LED does not light, you have a problem with either the cable or the device itself. In fact, that feature showed me that I had a problem with a bluetooth keyboard that did turn out to be defective. So the LEDs are more than a gimmick.<br /><br />The second thing I love is each of the four ports has individual overload protection. The advantage is if one port gets overloaded and shuts down the other devices that are connected will continue to charge. Plus you are not going to burn up an expensive phone or tablet if one of the ports does become overloaded.<br /><br />Having four fast charging ports, two of which are for tablets, is perfect for my household because we own an iPad, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 tablet, a Galaxy Note 3 phone and an iPhone 5S. This charger accommodates all four devices simultaneously and charges each (again simultaneously) as fast as the individual OEM chargers do for the tablets and phones.<br /><br />A final feature that I love is this is relatively compact and even fully loaded with some heavy duty cables all fit. That is important because some of the after market cables I use have large connectors and have caused problems fitting into other brands of multi-port chargers. The icing on the cake is this is a two prong charger, so it will plug into wall receptacles with only two prong plugs.<br /><br />This is perfect for home or travel and is a bargain when you compare price, features and function to other brands on the market.",

I tested it on the dash of my car which has a textured surface to which all other suction-style mechanisms failed to adhere. This one not only held, but did not budge holding my Galaxy Note 3 phone. That device is nearly the size of a tablet, so if it can hold that it will pretty much hold any other phone currently on the market.<br /><br />(2) The magnet mechanism is slick. It does not limit you to a particular size of phone. No grab arms with their inherent limitations. There are four methods of using it, including affixing the magnet directly to the back cover of your phone with the adhesive patch, or merely inserting it between your phone and a case holding your phone. For heavier cases this did not work for me. My [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion for Galaxy Note 3 Genuine Lambskin Folio Case]] added too much weight for the magnet to hold, but it's a very heavy case to start with. On the other hand it was a perfect solution for an iPhone 5S I tested with the [[ASIN:B00GS5ULOQ TOTALLEE Slim Skin iPhone 5 / 5S Snap On Hard Shell Case]], which is a more realistic test.<br /><br />One caveat: since this mount depends on a magnet I have to recommend against it for phones with S-pens (the Samsung Galaxy Note line) or similar devices. Magnets are known to cause issues for those types of phones. If you do not have such a device this is the best functioning phone mount I have come across and one I have no problem recommending to folks with devices that will work with it.",

This one is thick and is the best protection of any iPhone case that I have tested.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is not ugly - or not to my eyes. I love the red trim and large stitching because it gives a no nonsense look. Moreover, the red trim makes it easy to spot if you drop it while hiking or participating in strenuous activities. The synthetic leather looks like the real thing too and even has a leather like texture across the surface.<br /><br />Looks aside, where this case excels is in protection. The case is heavily padded and rigid. The enclosure that holds the phone itself is a little taller than the phone, and is made from a slightly pliable material that will absorb some shock if you drop the phone. The top cover and body are heavily padded and I am pretty sure a phone would actually survive a fall out of a shirt pocket on a hard surface while in this case. I did not test that, of course, but one only has to handle this case with a phone inside to get that impression.<br /><br />Form and fit are also perfect. All controls and features are easily accessible, and the two card slot held my Florida driver license and my debit card.<br /><br />The only potential issue I could find is when the top cover is closed you cannot attach a charging cable. That is due to the nature of the design of the flap style cover and not a problem with tolerances. When the cover is open there is not a charging cable that will not fit - even some that are notorious for requiring you to remove the phone from the case.",

However, I doubt if I will use that feature since I am alone most of the time and this is set up in my house instead of my car. Still, it's a pretty advanced feature that I have not seen on any other received I have used or tested.<br /><br />Among the phones with which I have tested this are a Samsung Galaxy Note II and 3, an iPhone 4S and an iPad, and an iPhone 5S.

The piece that looks like a flap is really a wide leather hinge that allows you to flip the case open quickly for access to phone functions. There are no card slots or other features that will ultimately make this case bulky. It's simply a case for your phone. Your slip iPhone 5 of 5S will still be slim while being protected by this case.<br /><br />It's not just any case - the flap is padded, so your phone is amply protected when it's closed. Also, the case part into which you slip your phone is all leather, but feels reinforced and has sufficient rigidity to protect the sides and back of your phone. Finally, access to all controls and functions are prefect and precision. Plus there is absolutely no interference with your charging connection (and I tested it with a cable that is known to be problematic for some cases.) A final feature is the cutout for the camera lens and flash do not interfere with that function.<br /><br />Construction is first rate, from high grade leather to stitching that I am betting will outlast the life of your phone.<br /><br />I am more than pleased with this case for all of the reasons cited above and the reasonable price point.",

I was a little put off initially by the design embossed on the cover, but have grown to love even that. Truth be known I would have preferred to not the 'bling' studs on the back side since there come across as a tad too feminine for a sixty five year old man. On the other hand, they do have a purpose - they slightly raise the case when it's sitting on a table, so would probably be a godsend if you knocked over a drink. Fortunately I have not put that to the test.<br /><br />All buttons, the S-Pen, camera lens and flash, and charging port are completely accessible. My phone fits the hard plastic case like a glove and is held securely in place. The flap is a snap type, so there are no magnets to interfere with the S-Pen.<br /><br />The pockets allow me to piggyback a a debit card and credit card on one slot, and a Florida driver's license in the other with room to spare for another card. If you carry more than four cards this may not be the case for you. It also holds folded US paper currency and my retired military ID in the wallet portion of the case.<br /><br />Bottom line: I love this case and am so pleased that someone was thoughtful enough to give it as a gift.

My review is based on prior experience with sports armbands and I will focus on that comparison.<br /><br />I received a review sample and had a ready point of comparison: a [[ASIN:B00F8HJM36 Mobile Maiden XXL Smartphone Workout Armband]]. That band had a few limitations for newer phones, but this one takes the design of a sports armband to a whole new level.<br /><br />First, this works with the larger phones. My Samsung Galaxy Note 3 fit, as did my Note 2. If you have a smaller phone, though, it may actually get a little lost in the ample pouch. Physically the inside dimensions of the pouch are 7.75 by 3,75 inches (although the top has slightly rounded corners that will take off about an eight of an inch.) Until someone comes out with a phone larger than the Note 3 this is the pouch to get for large smartphones.<br /><br />Second, the armband is heavy duty in every way: the thick, clear face will protect the phone while allowing you to still use your fingers to control all screen functions, and the padded arm strap and case construction are a giant leap over the Mobile Maiden armband to which I am comparing this one. Sound quality is superb even in the heavy case, and the protection that the design affords makes this perfect for strenuous activities. Having your phone enclosed in a zippered case versus one that has a slot to insert your phone is another level of protection that earns this one five stars in my opinion.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is perfect for large smartphones up to the biggest on the market at the time of this review. The protection is the best I have come across and it's comfortable to wear. Do heed my caveat about using this will small smartphones because those may actually flop around inside the pouch.",

While charging the ring will flash red, then return to solid blue once the phone is fully charged. On the 5C the phone was verified to be 100% charged when the indicator returned to blue. The test phone was relatively new, so the battery had not begun its gradual deterioration that happens to every battery regardless of phone or tablet brand. That may account for the disparity between my results and the one reported in the excellent and helpful December 9, 2013 review posted by buru buru piggu.<br /><br />The cable is a bit short at three feet, but well constructed. The lightning connector end is the culprit that prevents this cable from plugging into most cases and certainly the one on the phone with which this was tested. Had the light indicator ring been moved to the rear part of the connector the small jack of the lightning could be scaled to be a perfect replica of the OEM cable. Perhaps version 2 will incorporate that design.

Do read the dimensions carefully, though, before you purchase this model because it only fits phones of a certain size. Specifically, any phone that has a screen in the 4.3-5 inch range and is NOT larger than 3.3 inches wide or 5.5nches high will work.<br /><br />I tested this with an iPhone 4S and 5 and those fit perfectly. I knew my Samsung Galaxy Note II and Note 3 would not fit, but I had to try. No go, but this case is not designed for them.<br /><br />The heavy and strong armband is built to last, thanks to the dense webbing material and the generous amount of Velcro used. The latter makes this adjustable over a wide range, but this particular model is not designed for thin folks. I weigh over one ninety pounds - frankly I am overweight - and the band fit my arm in its smallest configuration. There is sufficient material to fit much larger folks, but I am guessing that if you are in the 150 pound or below range with thin biceps this is not going to work. End to end the band in it's smallest configuration measures about 12 inches. Use a tape measure around your arm to determine if it truly will fit.<br /><br />You can easily read the screen through the plastic protector, and you can also access buttons through it. The top of the case has a slot for access to the 3.5mm jack if you want to listen to music while running or participating in other sports. That is a nice touch that leads me to conclude that whoever designed this case actually uses one.<br /><br />It does not unduly muffle sound - you can hear and be clearly heard of you have your phone on speaker while wearing this. Of course you cannot do things like take photos unless you remove it from the case, but this is designed to keep your phone handy during sports activities.<br /><br />If you have a phone that fits this case and you want to keep it nearby while exercising or similar activities this case is ideal. Just be sure to measure it as I mentioned above if you are thin.",

    "text": "I ordered this case as an inexpensive interim solution until my budget allows me to get the [[ASIN:B00F5BOKGO Zenus Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Bohemian M Diary Wallet Case Cover [Brown] High End Genuine Leather Case for Galaxy Note III]]. That case, though, is a vanity purchase.<br /><br />This case is exceptionally well constructed and provides me with a layer of basic protection. Ever since cracking a screen on a phone I've insisted on a case. This one gives me a level of comfort. It is also convenient since I normally carry a few cards and my driver's license in the pockets. Those fit, but you cannot stuff this or it will simply not close properly.<br /><br />Things I love include the snap instead of a magnet (which would wreak havoc with the SPen), and the fact that this case appears to have been designed by someone who knew what they were doing because it fits the phone like a glove.<br /><br />I also love the conveniences like having the camera lens and all of the buttons and charging port accessible and unobstructed. Those and the fact that I do not need to replace the back cover of my phone with a kludge like some other cases are what sold me on it.<br /><br />Although it looks awkward to use for talking, it truly isn't. While this is an interim case I would have no problems using this as the only case for my Note 3 because, frankly, it does everything I want and need at an incredible price.",

    "text": "I received a review sample of this case from the manufacturer and with a friend put it through its paces. The reason I enlisted the aid of a friend is because she is very picky about cases and I value her opinion since she is on a continuing quest for the perfect case.<br /><br />Here are the results:<br /><br />Construction: beautifully made and built to last. The leather is first class and the plastic parts seem to be of equal quality. More importantly the slot for the credit card (the outside pouch will only hold one) fit every one I tried with no pushing or tugging. The wallet portion is good for six more cards and perhaps two or three US paper currency bills. As a side note the outside pouch will also accommodate a Florida driver's license.<br /><br />Fit to Phone: every button and the entire screen were easily accessible. The layout is perfect in that respect. Considering the number of cases my friend and I have tested this is one of the best for a glove-like fit that does not hamper phone functions or use. Note that if you have never tried a case like this one on an iPhone you will be disappointed by the way pictures turn out. This case is no exception - photos were a little fuzzy, but not because of this case's design. Every single brand and model case I have tested on the 4S exhibits this problem: without the case the photos are sharp and with a case they are slightly fuzzy.<br /><br />Best Uses: this case is perfect for any situation where the phone does not require maximum protection. Business use? Yes. Vigorous sports and similar activities? I would not use this case in those situations because the screen is flush with the outer edge of the case itself. In other words, there is no added protection if you were to drop the phone on a hard surface. However, this is not marketed as a maximum protection style case, but I wanted to set expectations in this review.<br /><br />One final thought: This case was not subjected to long term testing or use so the effect of the magnet in the wallet flap on encoded strips on credit cards and some ID cards is not apparent. If cards start failing I will update this review to reflect that.<br /><br />This is an attractive and well made case that happens to be functional as well. It ranks in the top three of over a dozen cases I have purchased and is a keeper.",

    "text": "I received a review sample in exchange for a review and have been having a blast with this simple-but-cool lens.<br /><br />The instructions discuss screwing the lens into a \"slim-line protective case\" when in fact that case is actually the clip and mine came  in the sealed package already installed. A few things you need to note:<br /><br />- If you are using a protective case for your phone (I am using a [[ASIN:B009VKSVTC Evecase Leather Wallet Case with Stand and Credit Card Holder for Samsung Galaxy Note 2]]) you need to remove your phone before you can clip on this lens.<br /><br />- This is a true fisheye lens that will capture a full 180 degrees. I took a shot of my music room, which normally takes three shots to fully capture and the one shot managed to include all of my amps, drums and instruments.<br /><br />- There is NO magnification. This is a straight through lens with the fisheye effect as the only feature.<br /><br />- Your photos will be framed in what will look like a black mat over a porthole. Sort of like a spy shot, and also ultra cool for some unique views of wide areas.<br /><br />I am concerned that the clip extends over my screen on my phone. There is a soft plastic patch with a slight texture that holds the lens in place and seems to protect the lens from scratching. On the other hand I had to reposition the lens to get to my camera icon on the screen. Since this is a new tool I am sure I will discover convenient workarounds. If so I will be sure to update this review.<br /><br />The package itself is simple: it comes with the lens pre-screwed into the clip, a small cloth bag and a lens cover. The latter is a nice touch. The price is nominal considering the quality of the photos I have taken with this already. In fact, I have been able to shoot some interesting pictures. It's a shame that Amazon has eliminated the customer-supplied image feature because a few pictures are worth thousands of words.<br /><br />For the price you cannot go wrong. Especially if you are used to shooting multiple times to get an entire subject. The best thing I can say is had I not been provided with a review sample I would purchased one of these anyway. They are that useful in certain situations and very high quality.",

Considering the extremely low price I could afford the risk of receiving absolute junk. Fortunately it turned out to be an amazing value - but not without a few flaws.<br /><br />For basic protection and good looks this case is hard to beat. There are a few small details that were either overlooked or considered 'good enough' by the manufacturer, which I'll get into, but then this case cost less than five bucks shipped.<br /><br />The strongest factor is the material and the way it has been cut and assembled afford excellent protection for your phone. The wallet and card slots are very nice touches that add functionality to the case.<br /><br />Plus it's simply beautiful.<br /><br />There are a few minor issues with the case that need to be disclosed. First, the fit and cut-outs are not precise. The part that holds the phone in place is a little loose and imperfectly measured. This causes the phone to slide a little to the left in the holder, which makes accessing keys on the left side of the screen keyboard difficult. You can still use the keyboard, but with some difficulty. See one of the photos that I uploaded for a visual. Also note that the part that secures the phone is somewhat larger than the phone, which results in a loose fit. The phone will slide out too easily and possible fall if you are not careful. Forewarned is fore armed.<br /><br />Two other very minor issues are: (1) imprecise way the cut-out is aligned to the camera lens (this is more of a aesthetic defect because it does not hamper taking photos). (2) a loose stitch right at flap that can easily be trimmed. Both are documented in the photos I've uploaded. I thought the loose stitch was a fluke, but it's a flaw on both this one and the other one I purchased.<br /><br />Minor issues notwithstanding, this case is a bargain, and an eye-catching one at that.

    "text": "I've uploaded a number of customer-supplied photos at the top of this page to illustrate some key points and shortcomings of this combo case.<br /><br />First, the positive: the set is a three-part system of components that was designed to protect your phone and provide convenient features such as a belt clip that doubles as a kickstand. The manufacturer certainly invested in both quality materials and molds to deliver a set of components that will protect your phone.<br /><br />The components are a (1) soft skin that affords a degree of protection and is ideal for light use. (2) is a hard cover into which the phone - protected by the soft cover - snaps for solid protection, and (3) is the belt clip into which the phone with the first two assemblies snaps. Clever.<br /><br />Where everything calls short is the design tolerances. First, with just the soft cover installed the case interferes with screen real estate making some characters in the virtual keyboard hard to tap. Worse, the camera's picture quality is greatly diminished by the poor tolerance in the video port in the case. See photos I've uploaded for an illustration of that. Finally, although the design of the belt clip that doubles as a kickstand is clever (shown in a photo I provided), the fixed angle either horizontally or vertically is way less of optimum for viewing in my opinion.<br /><br />I wanted to love this case because the concept is clever and the construction is superb. It's the tolerances and design that are disappointing. I hope the manufacturer comes out with a version 2.0 that rectifies these shortcomings because I feel this would be a real winner. As it is, though, I recommend that you consider alternative products.",

OK, I charged my phone one single time after fully charging the power bank and was down to 58%, the second phone I charged brought it down to 17%, both of our phones were only at 25% battery life. Well if my empty battery is 4600mAh size, shouldn't I get 5 charges out of the power bank if my phones are fully empty? I would have been happy getting 4 charges out of it and I might have kept it, but with the poor performance, I did not want to keep it and waste money. I also had a hard time with the power bank charging in wireless mode, it kept on turning off so I had to get a cable. I personally can't recommend it.",

I've got 5 bars 5G and still, it takes apps and searches to load multiple minutes. 50% of searches time out, while in the middle of a suburban area with excellent coverage. Customers service claims my phone might be the issue, it's not, worked great on t-mobile itself?!? They admitted that they are second class on the t-mobile network and get slowed down if there is a lot of use on the network. OK with that price, maybe I have to live with slower speeds, but not with constant timed out searches and loading speeds of multiple minutes. It's ridiculous and I'm very angry that I switched and left my cheap grandfathered in T-mobile plan to save $10 more per month.<br /><br />Soooo if you are a light user with patience and a smaller budget this works... if you are the main person in the household that needs data...

I'm glad I found the Pixel 3a, this is the best phone in the mid-range price out there. I know it is slightly more than my past range, but I finally wanted a phone that does more, but doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I read tons of reviews and watched several videos to make sure I'm not wasting my money (it's still a huge junk of change for me). I can say with delight, this phone is amazing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The camera is wonderful, it makes great pictures in low light, at night and has so many filters and options... I can't say enough how awesome the camera is.<br />- The battery life is amazing, my phone only lasted through the day if I didn't do anything. This phone lasts all day even with some gaming (1-2h).<br />- Basic Android with minimal bloatware<br />- I was able to transfer almost all my data with no issues or hick-ups<br />- There is a headphone jack - wahooo (I guess I'm old school,  but I like it)<br />- I love the fast charging option, never had it before and it is great getting 70% in 20min<br />- Super light and compact, I do appreciate the size and that this phone is smaller than my old<br /><br />Cons:<br />- no wireless charging<br /><br />I can't say much about material, the material seems to be the same as all my old phones. My friend with an Iphone of course pointed out that it looks cheap, but really.... I don't know anything else, so I don't care. I would totally buy it again and my husband is looking forward to getting one too. Thumbs up!",

    "text": "Update #2<br /><br />Forget about it, just don't buy this phone. I had plenty of problems almost right from the start, but now it almost doesn't work anymore. The phone is really just junk now, it freezes all the time, apps crash on a daily (hourly basis), text messages only go out if I restart the phone (and not all the time either), it won't log into any wi-fi anymore, so all is now on data. I'm waiting for black friday and some deals, but once I get a new phone, I will take my car and drive over this one.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Ok, sorry but I have to drop my rating by quite a lot, the phone turns out to be a pain in the backside. I had so many issues already and the tech support is really sad. They don't have anyone that would be able to assist with problems beyond the knowledge of the techs on the chat/phone. The latest issue is the icons being stuck after messages, downloads etc and I did all they told me to do, restart, empty cache and nothing helped. The tech had no more ideas and suggested a factory reset, I've done that before and I will not redo my whole phone again. Out of previous experience, it doesn't solve the issues the phone has. His next advice was to return the phone, well, that time passed too. I have to be honest, if amazon would allow me to return the phone, I'd go with a different brand and not buy Nokia again. I'm sad to say, this phone turned out to be a huge disappointment so far. If I hadn't paid so much money ($220 is a lot for me), I would just drive over it and buy myself something else. I think this brand could be great, might just take a couple of years and some more phones for them to figure out support and to resolve the many bugs they have. I was so excited in the first weeks, but every time you have a problem or find a bug, the same answer is, restart, empty cache and if that doesn't help, do the factory reset.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Ok, so I got this phone right when Amazon offered it on the market. I was always a huge fan of Nokia and even went with the Lumia while they were still working with MS on phones. I was so sad when they quit making phones and I stuck with the lumia line, which I'm sooo glad I can finally drop (not good phones, no support and only a pain to deal with). I was considering getting an android already last year, but when I heard that HMD is reviving the Nokia brand, I waited a whole year to see what they came up with. Granted, I had to put in some patience, since it took forever for them to get the phone on the US market. I was about to buckle and buy the new Motorola 5 series.<br /><br />The positive (coming from someone that had a low line lumia for a long time):<br />- camera, very nice and makes great pictures, I'm pretty sure there are better ones out there, but it's good for the price<br />- easy to use, not a lot of bloatware to delete<br />- great quality, it feels sturdy and well built<br />- huge storage to expand<br />- has dual sim in case you don't need to expand memory (kind of a negative too, it is one or the other, you can't have both)<br />- display is great and very clear even in sunlight<br /><br />Negative:<br />- no fast charging option<br />- the processor is very slow and I don't do much with my phone, but I noticed it<br />- there is no way to transfer your stuff from MS Lumia to Android, not sure if that is the phone's fault, but my hubby spent days researching and working on getting my stuff moved over<br />- there is no option to snooze your calendar entries, might be android calendar problem, but it's annoying<br />- there are not a lot of accessories to buy, hope there is more in the works. I got a case but it is super boring and bland<br />- tech support isn't very helpful with questions<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with it, I finally made the change over to Android and couldn't be happier. Thanks Nokia for being back and who knows, I might be persuaded to buy a slightly more expensive one down the road. The price was definitely a draw to Nokia compared to some other options out there.",

The dual USB ports on each are a nice bonus.<br /><br />She is thrilled with the colors and they worked perfectly when she tested on her phone.<br /><br />The price is certainly a good value for so many adapters and the quality is there. I would buy again.",

    "text": "I work from home and I don't want a lot of things cluttering up my desk. This phone stand is the best purchase I could have made to keep my phone upright and easy for me to view or access, while not taking up a lot of room. This is so much better than having my phone lay flat on the desk.<br /><br />This stand is sturdy and can be adjusted to most any angle you want. Again, so much easier for me to view the screen than having the phone lay flat.<br /><br />I especially like the rubber-lined base to keep the whole stand from moving around. Also the little feet you rest the phone on are rubberized…and the back inside surface. Not only does this keep my phone secure, but it is not noisy when I put it back on the stand each time. I often just reach over to tap the phone and it never moves, or I pick it up for more detailed use.<br /><br />AND… I can even put my tablet on this stand, if I want.<br /><br />I don't personally use this feature, but there is an opening for a charging cable if needed.<br /><br />This stand will hold up well, is stylish in appearance, and I see no need for me to look for anything else…and I think it's a great value.<br /><br />I have sent this out as Christmas gifts and sent one to my son's house for me to use when I'm visiting. Certainly functional in more than one room of your house.<br /><br />I highly recommend. The hardest thing is picking from the great selection of colors!",

This isn't a flaw or bug, it's common with these across most phones.<br /><br />What to do?  The &#34;Olive Oil Trick&#34; !<br /><br />Take olive oil, and a q-tip.  Get the smallest amount of oil on the end and gently run it around the screen protector.  It will hide the halo by filling in the air gap with the tiniest amount of oil.  When done, wipe clean.

It is the ONLY spring loaded holder that fits an iphone 5 (and probably the iphone 12 mini too)<br />I tried dozens of holders. Nothing else worked for all three of my criteria: a small phone, one-hand quick operation AND didn't block camera.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wish that it had a lock because I take it offroad on bumpy terrain.<br />I recommend putting a rubber sticky-back non-slip pad where the back of the phone hits for extra security if you mountain bike.<br />I also added a little grip in the top clip. My phone is TINY though.<br />The clamp that holds it to the handlebar works great but is bigger and bulkier than it needs to be, however it is a typical ball joint connection used in most phone holders and I happened to have another that I swapped.",

This one also had a a quick release button unlike the other.<br /><br />Two issues here, one is the clearance to get a bottom power cord between the two pegs is incredibly tight. Second issue is the quick release button is behind those two pegs. If you mount this on the vent so that it is secure, the thing is resting on the button making it virtually impossible to hit the button without ruining the positioning/security of the whole thing.<br /><br />An additional issue with mine which is perhaps just a defect is that the quick release button isn't well, quickly releasing to the whole width. You can hold that baby for a long time before it opens the whole way.  And since it is nearly impossible to get to button when it is mounted you can see why it tried my patience long enough.<br /><br />UPDATE: I won't be getting another phone for a long time and even though it has been awhile the vendor offered me a refund since this is not working with my current phone.",

It is not a phablet but with even a thin case on it the stretch for the cradle type mounts requires too much effort and scary pushing/squishing/flexing of the phone. I thought this was the answer to my prayers.<br /><br />It was packaged nicely and all parts were fine. Does seem like a quality product. I put one of the metal plates between the rubberized case and the phone's case, high middle of the back. The phone went to sleep. I turned it on with a touch on home button and the screen was kerfluffled. It was all black except for a music note symbol, some other symbols and the time. No response to any screen touches. I had to power off and reboot without magnet to back home screen.<br /><br />I experimented with different places of plate/magnet. If I went lower I would get a popup saying I was using an unknown network and might incur charges, huh?<br /><br />So, I need to give up. Your mileage will vary. I can say as far as this model of phone I would steer clear of the magnets. Has nothing to do with mfr or vendor I am sure, it is just the magnetic field type of connection that is not compatible with my particular phone.  So I figure the fair thing to do is give it a medium rating. There is nothing I can see wrong with it but my phone doesn't like it.",

    "text": "I bought this phone a little more than a year ago off of a popular internet auction site that shall remain nameless. As occasionally happens there, I got an uncommunicative seller who shipped in very very poor packaging ending with me with a loose phone/battery and box in another box but the phone appear(s)ed to be working okay.<br /><br />I bought this phone as a locked AT&T phone but had already done my homework/pricing to unlock it. As I use Consumer Cellular it did not really need to be unlocked to work with their network but I went ahead and purchased an unlock code and did it myself successfully. Please note unlocking is not the same as rooting. How I wish I could root this phone! It is not easy to do, and I even paid some folks for fixes and got my money back after they failed. So, unlock can be done. I have done it. Rooting is very difficult and should only be attempted by professional in the field.  I did need consumer cellular help to get it to hook up with their APN so I could get data. Took a few calls but I am OK.  Would hate to think what just another brand unlocked phone would be like to get going since technically, CC uses AT&T it should not have been this difficult.<br /><br />I bought this to wean off of a Blackberry. I had tried some waawee huawei whatever smartphone and hated the onscreen keyboard with a passion and the fact it was a little piece of junk.  I didn't have much faith in RIM and BB continuing but still wanted a physical keyboard so this fit the bill.  I agree that while the pull out keyboard is nice, it is not really that easy to type on.  Gradually over the year I have been using the onscreen misery more just because that has the autocorrect. It is a nice option to have a real keyboard so enjoy while you can.<br /><br />Besides the issue with getting this phone to accept another APN (even though it was unlocked) the Samsung issues are as follows:<br /><br />1) Yes the battery life sucks.  Sometimes if I come home and forget to hook it to power for overnight it is dead dead dead in the morning.  Just resign yourself to giving it a good charge at the minimum once a day/night.<br /><br />2) GPS flaw.  Two issues there actually.  One is the darn thing won't lock and will just drain your battery when you turn it on for an app that requires it. It requires a reboot for the GPS to lock if the phone has not been rebooted in a day or two. Second is it is so bad it can just overheat/shutdown the phone even if it did lock.<br /><br />3) External memory micro SD problem. This is reportedly an issue with a) all androids or b) all samsungs or c) counterfeit cards. Pick one.  I replaced the teeny 2GB that came with my Glide with a Kingston 32GB class 4 card. I had issues with the apps that were moved to SD disappearing but nothing a reboot or reinstall of app would not fix until yesterday when the phone got hot as the surface of the sun and gave me the dire message of damaged SD card after I rebooted to get the GPS working (yes, do not depend on this phone in a pinch, please don't).<br /><br />The card is dead as in doornail not recognized by this or any device or able to hold formatting. Getting warranty replacement on the card but beware if you want to upgrade.  I have no advice after reading so many conflicting accounts about just what is the problem with Android or Samsung and external cards. Apparently these days it is no longer common to even have capability for an external card on a droid so leads me to believe it is an OS thing.<br /><br />As a phone.  Call quality is less than stellar if you ask me.  But I am mostly in marginal areas and have not had an issue in fantastic signal areas.<br /><br />Data - accept that in good signal areas with hyperband whathave you when it will forget it is unlocked it seems to be fine.  If it forgets it is unlocked in some special AT&T service area it requires turning data on/off again to do the other APN thing again.<br /><br />Camera - very nice.  Haven't used the front much, I don't want to see me any more than anybody else would want to.<br /><br />You can see here this phone has required me to do more technical stuff than I care to. It is nice to have a keyboard, camera is very good and it has not dropped dead on me so giving it four stars rather than three.",

It does not interfere with the keyboard at all, and fit perfectly.  It is worth the money.  I would be paying twice the price for it or anything but for this price, a nice deal.  The shipping was very fast from eForCity (NO apparently purchase was not eforcity and it was good see later comments) and it was just a padded envelope but really, this is just a little bit of plastic, who needs more packaging?  Oh, I just happened to have cut myself quite badly earlier in the day and well, had a bandaid that was not holding back the tide anymore. To make a long story short, got blood on the case as I was putting it on the phone and figured well that was the end of that, but hey, blood wiped right off with a little windex.  Not too shabby.  At this price I might order a second to have on hand but still have to think about how I like my phone White.<br /><br />Well, after two days, I noticed the white phone I now loved had awful black streaks.  They were being caused by my walmart purse lining.  Oh well, nothing I tried in the way of cleaners took them off so I was determined to find a new purse or line the old purse with something white because I LOVED my phone in the white case.  Well, I decided to line the purse with some white interface iron stuff but in the meantime ordered two more white cases.  Well, I thought I ordered the from the same place, same case,etc.  Was badly disappointed.  The vendor for eforcity case, err, EFORCITY, sent me two pieces of garbage.  They were stiff, cheap, brittle, rough edge plastic that did not fit my phone and had different cutouts from the previous rubberized case I loved.  I emailed them, showed them pics and did get a refund.  However, I am still left with just my poor black streaked eforcity white rubberized case now.  Going to try mr clean magic eraser on it this weekend.  Darn, I LOVE this case and didn't want anything to happen to it.<br /><br />But BEWARE, if your case doesn't have a great big cutout for  camera/flash/speaker instead of a tiny hole, it is hard plastic that is inferior to this excellent rubberized stuff with a custom fit. Accept no substitutions.<br /><br />More UPDATE: which I should have done before this.  OK, some items you have to be careful of when you order if you really liked the last order that you are ordering from the same vendor.  I did so love this white case.  Unfortunately, my cheap wallyworld purse lining stained the heck out of it to black grimy dirty that apparently nothing can clean. No, Mr clean magic erasers didn't work either.  I was distraught.  Looked into other purses and lining the current black one to keep my phone case, WHITE.  Well, in the meantime I ordered two more of what I THOUGHT was the same case, right from here, the link to the original one ordered.  Anyhow, long story short, I had to go to another website/search engine to find what I originally bought here.  And yes, if you find the big hole one it is the genuine article and will fit your captivate fine.  Just be very careful of where you put it, even a dark denim pocket in your jeans, etc is likely to stain it.  A shame, it is a wonderful case, so nice in white but too easy to stain.",

It took me 2 or 3 tries to get it aligned correctly, but when I did it immediately went flat to screen with no bubbles.

To access the macro lens you need to unscrew the wide angle lens. It comes with lens caps and a drawstring carrying case.<br /><br />Limitations include:<br />1. You can't have a protective screen on your phone as the fit is THAT snug<br />2. No flash when using this attachment<br />3. You need to take it off when calls come in<br />4. You need a very steady hand to get crisp macro images, and you need to be thiscloseupto your subject<br />5. The lens caps have a mind of their own and disappear into thin air.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's portable and quick to attach, and comes in very handy when taking architectural photos or landscapes to send to friends or post online.

The touch screen remains completely accessible, and you won't even know the protector is there until the phone takes a tumble and survives.<br /><br />The package also includes a wet wipe for cleaning the screen to prep it for installation, a small microfiber cloth, a plastic squeegee for removing air bubbles and two aluminium buttons (one black and one silver) for covering the home button. (The screen protector doesn't cover the home button, leaving it in a slight depression, so these buttons are to fill the space and cheer it up)<br /><br />You'll need to be careful when aligning the protector during installation, as you don't get a second chance to get it right without causing air bubbles or discoloration that the squeegee can't get out. The instructions are very easy - it's the steady hand required to line it up that causes problems.<br /><br />If you're going to use the aluminium button to cover the home button, place it before applying the protective screen, which makes everything easier to align.  I found that the sensitivity of the home button was reduced, and getting it off again is very difficult without messing up the protector, so test it first before applying the screen.<br /><br />My only problem is that even though it's not very thick, that extra layer prevents me from using my three-in-one photo lens attachment, which I use regularly, being a photo-fanatic.<br /><br />A wonderful investment to protect your expensive phone from cracks and scratches, but the extra thickness may cause some problems with accessories.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 4, 2013",

    "text": "From Hayao Miyazaki, the master of Japanese animation, comes a story similar to The Little Mermaid, where a small and ever-so-cute fish-like female becomes infatuated with a land dwelling male, and moves heaven and earth, and a lot of ocean to try to make her dream come true.<br /><br />Short attention span summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Fish girl lives with her father and siblings in an aquarium-like home inside a really cool submarine with flippers.<br />2. Headstrong and clever, she sneaks out to see the surface, and encounters the debris of human civilization, immediately getting into trouble.<br />3. She is rescued by a young boy, and a strong bond is forged between the two.<br />4. Daddy comes to the rescue to save his kidnapped child<br />5. ... but finds that girls just wanna have fun<br />6. Everything goes topsy-turvy until her mother shows up<br /><br />Ponyo is a wonderfully entertaining movie for young children, and although not as strong in plot as Miyazaki's other movies like Princess Mononoke or Howl's Moving Castle, the animation is excellent, and the story will touch your heart.<br /><br />There is no shortage of voice talent, with Noah Cyrus (Miley's little sister) as Ponyo, Frankie (the bonus) Jonas as her friend Sosuke, and also Tina Fey, Matt Damon, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Cloris Leachman, Betty White and Lily Tomlin.<br /><br />This is one to see with the entire family, but falls just short of perfect with a few too many inexplicable elements.  Recommended for the fantastic animation, simple plot, characters and ecological message, and very strongly recommended for families with young children.<br /><br />Rated: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 15, 2009",

    "title": "Making and receiving calls, and much more",
    "text": "Basically, what I need in a cell phone is the ability to make calls to people I want to speak with, and to receive calls from people who need to speak with me.  That's it!<br /><br />Of course, any old phone will do that, but there's my image to look out for, so I also want it to look expensive and sleek, to be able to pick up signals even in office blocks, have long battery life, and have tons of cool features to talk about, even if I never use them.  The ability to withstand sudden impacts and the occasional passing shower is also an asset.<br /><br />So far, this phone has met all my needs as follows:<br /><br />(1) It makes calls just great<br />(2) It receives calls clearly<br />(3) It looks trendy with its cute little handle-shaped antenna, which is very useful as a handle when pulling it from your bag<br />(4) It's not the most expensive, but it looks like a million bucks<br />(5) It picks up signals in office buildings (and elsewhere)<br />(6) Excellent battery life<br />(7) It fell and survived  (JAN 16 - EDIT: IT FELL AGAIN AND THE INTERIOR DISPLAY IS DAMAGED. THE PHONE HOWEVER STILL WORKS)<br />(8) It got drizzled on and survived<br /><br />Feature wise:<br /><br />(1) It has a camera and can take video recordings<br />(2) You can set up speed dialing fairly easily<br />(3) It has flashing lights when it rings, and you can change the light shows (or turn the darn thing off already)<br />(4) Lots of memory for lots of numbers, e-mail addresses, birthdays and so on<br />(5) You can set different lights and ring tones for each one of your friends<br />(6) You can show a different photo on the display outside to the one inside.<br />(7) It has a stopwatch and calculator<br />(8) It has a loud speaker! (All the better for us all to hear you my dear)<br />(9) Media player, and use can use a headphone (sold separately)<br />(10) Voice activated commands (Answer and Busy, or you choose)<br />(11) Changeable covers to meet your mood (Always gray, thank you)<br />(12) Big numbers and letters for easy dialing and text messages (if you're the texting kind)<br />(13) It can vibrate!!!!!!!! (Call me back! Call me back!)<br />(14) I had somebody send me Crazy Frog as a ring tone, so I can REALLY annoy my favorite people.  (It's got Bluetooth and infra-red for transferring data - but don't ask me how to use them - I just like saying that I have it)<br />(15) Lots of shortcut keys to get to things quickly<br />(16) Internet services (I can't use these yet, because my provider doesn't offer it)<br />(17) it has a very nice alarm clock feature<br /><br />Things not so great about it:<br /><br />(1) The position of the camera button is bad for me.  I use a Body Glove case, and when I pull out the phone, I sometimes inadvertently take a picture on the way out.  Similarly when trying to open it in a hurry.<br />(2) The picture quality isn't the best<br />(3) It's not easy to open with one hand<br />(4) While the volume buttons are conveniently placed on the side, I sometimes hit them when answering a call.<br />(5) The sound is kinda tinny<br />(6) Not enough cool ring tones (yeah, I can get more, but using Bluetooth means I have to read the manual)<br />(7) You have to remember to use the arrow keys to get to other tabs in the menus to see all the features<br />(8) Speed dialing needs two buttons (I'm accustomed to holding down one button)<br />(9) The lights go out really quickly before you can finish deciding what you're looking for<br /><br />Overall, a great phone for the price, and it looks good too.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, January 10, 2006",

It requires 2  standard wall chargers and 2 usb to micro cables plugged into PowerCore simltaneously to get the 4.0 amps required for all 4 charging lights to show complete charge. I have left a single 2.0 amp samsung phone wall charger plugged in for more than 24 hours and just get past 2 led lights to 3... never to 4.  I did purchase a wall charger that has dual output ports at 3.0 amp and 1.5 amp ... which gets the job done with 2 cables.  Be aware.. almost all new wall chargers have USB-C outputs...  and your drawer full of old usb to micro cords won't work without an additional adaptor...  good luck finding USB-c to Micro USB cable...<br />I am satisfied with the power supplied just wish I had known about the high amps required to charge...

The written instructions are very good, but what's even better is that they also offer a two minute video instruction which clearly demonstrates how to install the screen protector on your phone.  Between the written and video instructions, you'll have a flawless bubble-free installation.  Perhaps best of all, the end of the instructions say something like: &#34;Don't worry if it doesn't turn out right. Call us and we'll try to help in any way we can.  And this product has a lifetime guarantee, so we'll send you another set of screen protectors if you mess up the first batch.&#34;  What else can you ask for?  Customer service doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />After installing the screen protector, Galaxy Note touch screen response and S-pen work perfectly.  And the protector is crystal clear.  It does not detract from the Galaxy Note experience at all.<br /><br />Consider using these screen protectors with the OtterBox Commuter case (which comes with a screen protector that is not as good as the iSmooth).<br /><br />Finally, included with the 3 screen protectors and lint removal stickers, is a large high-quality microfiber cleaning cloth. The cleaning cloth alone makes the purchase a positive.",

    "text": "After reading many reviews on the OtterBox cases, I initially ordered an OtterBox Commuter because a lot people were complaining about the Defender's added bulk and the screen protector getting dusty.<br /><br />The OtterBox Commuter is an excellent case, no question about it. But for me, there was one problem: the Galaxy Note 2 in an OtterBox Commuter is still too big to fit comfortably in your pocket. In fact, you're going to eventually wear a hole in most pants if you keep your Galaxy Note 2 Commuter in your pocket all day (the corners of the case rub and stretch the fabric when you're sitting down, and digging the phone in and out of your pocket all day puts stress on the pocket seams as well).<br /><br />So I ordered an OtterBox Defender to try out. Having used both, I prefer the OtterBox Defender over the Commuter. The Defender's outer shell has a nicer grip that feels better and more secure in your hand. The built-in screen protector has not been an issue (I was worried about it after reading some other people's reviews, but so far I have no complaints about dust or its usability). And the Defender's belt clip allows you to wear the phone on your belt instead of in your pocket. Granted, phone belt clips are not ideal but it's better than ruining your expensive dress work pants. Also, the Defender belt clip is very high quality and it positions the phone flat against your side so it's not that bad looking.<br /><br />In terms of added bulk, the Defender is really not much larger than the Commuter (certainly less of a difference than I was expecting).<br /><br />Finally, the Defender does offer more rugged protection than the Commuter - although the Commuter is probably more than adequate protection for most normal situations.<br /><br />Overall, I really like the OtterBox Defender case and am very happy with it.",

I had to surface, open the case, turn on the screen, and then start again, which defeats the purpose. I gave this 4 stars for being waterproof, but I'd honestly give it less stars for versatility.

    "text": "This is probably the worse phone I have ever had.  It is not user friendly at all. I have not downloaded many apps and do not use many apps. I don't use the bluetooth and only use data when I have wifi access.  I know this is not the galaxy 111 but based on the high ratings on Samsung phones I really expected better performance.  I just switched from a blackberry, but this is really disappointing.  Not even the basic features like making a call works well.  Its just two months and I really cannot put up with this for much longer.  Think I will go Iphone.<br /><br />Pros:  Nice size phone- attractive.<br /><br />cons:  The buttons on either side of the centre menu buttons do not light up and takes very long to respond when pressed.<br />  There is no way to cut off or end a call other than waiting until the touch screen pops up with the end button which takes quite a while after you have dialed - this has resulted in the<br />  person on the other end hearing me for at least 15 seconds after I think I have ended the calls.<br /><br />  Battery life started out really great for the 1st three weeks or so giving me at least 2 days without charging using wifi and apps.  Now - about 2 weeks later its down to less than a<br />  day- I have to charge daily.<br /><br />  The dual sim does not allow you to  pick which sim to call from - it has to be set on 1 at a time and to change you have to go to the settings options and change it.  I had dual sim phones before and when you dialed a number there was an option to choose which sim to dial from.  For incoming calls it automatically diverts the calls from the sim which is not set, to the sim which is set without the callers knowing that their call is going to another carrier.<br /><br />Difficult to store numbers in the phone book - in fact from time to time I am unable to access some numbers which I know were stored and I did not delete.<br /> contacts which were automatically stored as SNS cannot be edited.<br /><br />Sometimes you dial a number, and press call- it just diverts back to the main menu- this happens regularly now.<br /><br />The list goes on.....<br /><br />I definitely will not recommend this phone.",

The only problem is that this phone does NOT come with a SIM card.  It is very easy to transfer data ( contacts, videos, pictures, calendar, settings, etc) from the old phone to the new phone. You connect USB point to each phone, in a minute or two it's finished.  After all data transferred, wifi password entered and all settings were identical to his &#34;old&#34; phone. However,  new phone it would not connect to wifi.  Why?  Because there was no SIM card included with the phone.  Had to go to Verizon store to buy a sim card - only $16.  They installed the card  and they activated the phone, thus  disables your old phone.  Be sure to get the glass protector.!!!  This design of phone  uses &#34;liquid glass&#34; - literally, its a vile of liquid you purchase and Verizon rubs the liquid on the glass face of the phone display in 3 quick steps  This liquid glass costs $52 with tax, but otherwise the display will crack if you drop it.

That works well, but can get very expensive very quickly.<br /><br />My husband and friend installed this booster system on the big farm truck and horse trailer so we can use it when we're hauling horses to shows or the ranch and at the ranch. They both did serious amounts of cursing and carrying on getting everything put together and it took two hours. I made a point to be elsewhere until it was done.<br /><br />We were able to upgrade our one bar (AT&T only) on two LG cellphones to 3 bars at the hilltop 50 miles before the ranch. That's a significant improvement because the old one bar was mostly voice only - data was molasses slow. I was able to send and receive email on my phone like I can in big cities.<br /><br />Once we got off the paved road and into the Chisos Mountains heading into the ranch, we lost all connection like normal. I was able to get two bars standing on top of the horse trailer at the actual house which sits on a mesa overlooking the Rio Grande and Mexico. I'm pretty pleased - I can make calls from the house without the satellite phone or the 50 miles trek. We still need the sat phone on horses and in the back country, but that's fine.",

So essentially, after 2 full days being installed and just one day on the road in semi truck, this thing has already begun to fall.<br /><br />*****Original review below*****<br />My husband needed a better holder for his cellphone and small GPS unit when he's on the road in the semi truck. This rack is sturdier than it first appears coming out of the box n a million pieces. This thing requires total assembly and frankly, I found that more than a little obnoxious. Several of these small pieces could be shipped installed and essentially ready to use since it's already in a large box. The end foot pieces could certainly be attached to the pole before the customer gets it, cutting down significantly on the number of small pieces to keep track of.<br /><br />Once we got it together, the magnetic holder for the phone was easy enough to place and adjust for location. The set includes the adhesive and metal piece to attach to your phone case so it just snaps onto the holder via magnets. There are little feet that extend down to help balance the phone if you have a really big one.<br /><br />The suction cups to attach the entire contraption to the truck dash are reasonably tough and hold on well enough on the flat top dash area. This bar is flexible and can bend, but trying to attach the suction cups to the slightly uneven surface adjacent to radio panel didn't work. It'll take a few thousand miles in the big rig to find out exactly how sturdy this rack is and if it can stand up to the rigors of actual OTR truck driving.",

I had been considering this phone and the new LG V30, but decided I didn't want another carrier locked phone with all the bloat ware buried in it. Nor was I interested in a price tag upwards of six hundred dollars - new phones have gotten obscenely expensive. However, after two weeks of use, this Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra is a bargain for several reasons.<br /><br />The six inch screen is not only a pleasure to use, it's simply gorgeous. The clarity and colors are outstanding. Watching a true HD show on the phone is as pretty as watching it on out big TV. I use two hands to type or surf the web because I am using a flip case on the phone. I have literally tried five different screen protectors and none of them fit. The curved sides mean a glass protector just doesn't cover the entire screen - I had to resort to a wallet style case to provide a bit of cover over the screen.<br /><br /> The camera is really a joy to use. It has an option for moving stills and super fast shutter for action shots - love this when I'm photographing the horses. The details on close ups are equally great - you can see every hair on our fluffed up Siamese cat.<br /><br />It only comes with 32gig of memory so you definitely need a beefy micro SD card if you take a ton of photos. I simply moved my 64gig card from my old phone and I was good to go. Everything transferred and populated the new phone. Because this is unlocked and I didn't owe anything on my old phone, I swapped my SIM card from the old phone to this one and was making/receiving calls and texts within minutes. We use AT&amp;T and I had zero drama swapping my phones out.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with the battery life here. My old LG had a removable battery and I was changing batteries or recharging at least once a day. This Xperia has gone from 6 am to around 10pm every day for 6 days straight without needing to be charged. I do most of my email, make calls, text a ton, print stuff, use the Audible app for books and take multiple photos daily - I basically use my phone instead of a tablet or laptop most of the day. The last two nights when I've finally charged it at bedtime, the battery was at 52% and 48%. I don't worry about it going dead if I'm having an extra long day. Honestly, I've just fallen in love with this phone and I will never go back to a carrier locked phone in the future.",

His phone is constantly getting banged around, tossed in luggage, exposed to high heat, cold, damp and blowing sand. We've tried every case on the market and the only thing that is reliable are the heavy duty Otterboxes, but they add bulk and reduce the touch screen capacity - especially with gloves in winter. When I saw this CAT phone, I knew he needed to give it a try.<br /><br />It's fully ruggedized and water proof. The specs indicate that it can take a drop, extreme temperatures, sand and water exposure. The phone is essentially built into its own Otterboxes style case, including a permanent screen protector. No more bubbles! All of the ports - charging, ear phone and sim card & memory card slots are sealable. This adds bulk to the phone, of course, but it's not a big deal. A reasonable trade-off for protection you don't have to fiddle with.<br /><br />The screen is clear and very responsive, even with thin gloves on. The colors on videos are sharp and true. (See photos - the horse and rider are Edward Gal on Glock Voice in Europe) Calls are clear for both sides, though the volume could be a bit higher for windy conditions. This phone is certified for use with multiple hearing aids if needed. Surfing the internet via both WiFi and our AT&T cellular connection is snappy and stutter free because there's relatively little bloat ware preinstalled since this is an unlocked phone. We have a couple of games on it - Bejeweled, Angry Birds and Solitaire and all work smoothly with no stumbling. Watching YouTube videos is also fast and trouble free. The enormous battery boggles the mind when compared to the old Sony phone - watching twenty minutes of videos, playing Bejeweled (notorious battery hog) for ten minutes and sending texts only reduced the battery from 98% to 90%.<br /><br />My only complaint is the camera quality. It takes decent photos, but the old Xperia phone had an amazing camera, so decent is a bit of a let down. The pictures are fine for just quick snaps of the dogs being cute or a selfie, but if you want to take beautiful family pics, this camera probably isn't the best choice.  All the other features far outweigh this small issue for us though. The battery size and ruggedized construction alone are enough to make my husband very happy with the CAT phone.",

I thought this Bravo unit would be useful on the car key chain. Alas, the one I received was totally dead within moments of opening the package.<br /><br />The button you push to start the Bluetooth pairing with the phone beeped once and then never again. The unit cannot be seen by the app or my phone. The app and my phone are both fully connected to my first TrackR, but do not or can not see the new TrackR. The unit itself no longer beeps when you push the button. There's clearly a quality control issue with these gadgets because several other reviews have had the same problem as mine.",

Worth every penny!<br /><br />***** Original review below. *******<br /><br />My last screen protector did it's job - it cracked after I dropped my phone on the driveway. My screen was perfect underneath the various cracks though. I had to replace it and this one fits exactly as it should. It was pretty simple to install and I don't have any bubbles under it. There's been no degradation in responsiveness or quality of the images on my phone with this protector in place. I did receive two of them in this package.",

    "text": "Sooo....I'm house sitting for a neighbor who has a fancy schmancy alarm system and a garage door opener that both only work via apps on her smart phone. No big deal except that she couldn't figure out how to add a second phone access to her existing system before she left on her cruise. The solution? She left her new Galaxy 7 phone with me for 10 days so I could arm/disarm the alarm and get in and out of the house to feed the chinchillas and water the plants. Great....except her brand new phone has no case. (FACE PALM)<br /><br />In order to prevent destruction of her phone on my watch, because that is always how these things go.... I put this case on it. Otterbox cases are a must for my own phones and have saved mine more than once from drops, Donkey teeth, water troughs and worse. This one fits her Galaxy 7 exactly right and I am having no trouble using the touch screen to input the codes needed for the access. I took photos of the chinchillas yesterday and the case didn't interfere with the camera lens. Plus the flame red is actually quite pretty and easy to spot in my purse compared to the blue of my own phone. I'll keep this case after she gets back so I have it for the next time.",

    "text": "There is a warning on the product page for these screen protectors about a fit issue. The slight curved sides of the face of the phone cause the the tempered glass screen shield to have to be slightly smaller than the actual phone screen. It simply cannot bend like the sides of the phone without cracking etc. Once you get this unit on your Xperia X, it does fit per the specs given and the front camera, speaker and notification alert light are all easily used and not blocked.<br /><br />My issue was getting it lined up just right - the inexact fit means you have think about the placement and if you don't get it right on the first try, you can end up with a bubble or crooked corner. Fortunately, there are two screen protectors in the package and two sets of the application stickers. Once it's on there isn't a noticeable degradation of screen clarity or responsiveness and it has stayed in placed with no movement for several days now.<br /><br />******** UPDATE August 18, 2016 ********<br /><br />We've had this screen protector on our phone for about 6 weeks now and use the phone every day. So far there have been no problems with the protector and it hasn't peeled up or come off. The key is just to apply it dead center and get it on correctly the first time. I have not experienced any problems with the use of my phone's screen or immediate responsiveness from it either.",
