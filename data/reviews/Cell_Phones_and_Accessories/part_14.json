You can see the joint lines from the molding, the USB cutout is slightly off center, and the camera cutout has somewhat of a sharp corner (it is not rounded).  I got the black plastic version to avoid the yellowing of the clear TPU, and the black plastic has this sheen that doesn't look very high end and is not very smooth.  I think a matte black plastic would have worked better.  However, as of writing this review, this is the only case for the S20 FE that has a clear acrylic back and black TPU sides, so I'd recommend this case if that's the kind of design you are looking for.",

    "text": "[[Impressions]]<br /><br />I bought this screen protector because a previous one I had with a camera hole was collecting a ton of dust in the camera hole cutout.  Since the hole is so small it's really difficult to clean out and makes selfie shots a bit washed out.  This one doesn't have the hole, so you won't have this problem, and I can't tell any difference in quality in the selfie camera.  Even if the glass reduces light to the camera, it's still probably a lot better than with the dust.  It's also easier to install because you don't need to line up the camera hole cutout since there is none.  I also didn't get any bubbles that I couldn't press out.<br /><br />[[What's Inside]<br /><br />The package comes with three sets of 1) screen protector, 2) wet and dry wipes, and 3) a dust sticker and 2 guide stickers.<br /><br />[[Build Quality]]<br /><br />I did notice some issues with this screen protector.  One side (right side when removal sticker tab is facing up and down) always caused a large rainbow fringe to show up on my screen even though the edge of the screen protector went past the screen.  I had to offset that side significantly to remove the issue.  Some of the protectors also had chips on that side that were distracting.  The screen protector is actually a safety glass laminate so I'm guessing the machinery might need to be refurbished at the factory.  I tried another brand of screen protector that didn't have a camera hole and had the same issues though.  Thankfully, Ailun's customer service was excellent and they shipped me a new set of protectors and I was able to choose the one with the least rainbowing.<br /><br />[[My Install Guide]]<br /><br />To install, I suggest running a hot shower with the shower door/curtain open.  Let the room steam up and remove any towels or anything that can create lint from the bathroom.  Outside the shower, wipe the protector as it might have some sharp glass bits leftover from the cutting process.  Wipe and dry your phone.  Align the protector with the screen of the phone, then tape the protector to the phone so that it forms a hinge.  I had to use a lot of tape as the tape doesn't stick well to the protector.  Put some more tape along the other edge of the protector to act as a flap.  Move into the shower room, flip open the hinged screen protector, and then clean the screen one last time.  Use the included stickers to stick the entire screen once over to remove any dust.  Once you see that there's no dust, quickly remove the protective clear sticker from the screen protector and flip it onto the phone screen.  Press out any remaining bubbles.  Use a flashlight or turn the screen brightness up to check for dust, and if you see any, carefully lift up the screen and use a sticker to stick away the dust which should be stuck to the bottom of the protector.  There should be very little dust since you are in the steamy room.  The protector should be slightly wet underneath due to the steam, so you can probably slide it around slightly to get the last bit of alignment.  With this method, you won't have to spend hours attaching the protector and getting rid of dust.",

    "text": "General Thoughts:<br /><br />The fit is true to the phone (Revvl 4+).  With a case (Sucnakp brand), this protector is about 1-2mm from the edge of the case on all sides.  I like that the plastic film on the protector comes off very easily compared to other brands - this makes applying the protector fast and avoids dust.  They are also very generous and include 3 microfiber towels that are thicker and larger than others I've used.  Finally, the glass itself seems to be higher quality with nice rounded edges.  Touch sensitivity is fine and the feeling is the same as the original screen.  The only thing they could improve on would be to include an alignment frame like some other brands.<br /><br />How I Applied:<br /><br />I wasted one screen protector when installing due to dust but the second one turned out well.  I cleaned my screen and the protector with the included alcohol wipe and microfiber towel.  Make sure to wipe the protector as it might scratch the phone in the next step.  I lined up the protector with the phone and then taped it onto the phone like a hinge using the included stickers.  Then I wiped the phone again and then used the included stickers to thoroughly remove all dust from the screen.  Once all the dust was gone, I quickly unpeeled the protective plastic from the protector and flipped it onto the screen.  You have to do this last step fast to avoid dust.  I had to lift the corner of the screen slightly to remove some remaining dust particles but otherwise it came out very well.",

However there isn't that for the car mount so I'm going to try and use a different tactic for this one but it's very convient that it brings it, nd it's a great stand I recently put it, if it lasts more than a.

If you're not going to use the fingerprint scanner on ur phone then this is for you,  this is the only and I mean only full body case with a built in screen protector that I have ever bought on any phone that actually fits the screen so well there are no bubbles nor weird smudged underneath the plastic screen protector is right on the screen which makes it look great ! I had to modify mine and razor blade cut the screen protector to come off. This is an amazing screen protector nothing compared to any other one. And I promise I'm not over exaggerating. No one paid me to right this I'm a legit person. All other built in screen protectors I can peel off easily with no worries, this one was a battle and edging of tht screen protector is very thick not like most cases that are very flimsy that if I squeeze a little bit it will break.  Get this only if u don't want to use the finger print scanner.!",

Good thing I ordered it. The case is very good and not cheap looking/cheesily made and the kicker is that there's a pop up stand in case you want to watch Netflix or any online videos on your phone. The material for this case is made out of silicone like the material that breast implants are made out of and it's quite cushy and it will protect your phone in case you drop it. I already dropped my E4 and it hit the sides but bounced a little and I looked at it and no damage! It's material it's firm but still flexible and every button in your E4 lines up exactly on this case. I highly recommend this case for the durability and the futuristic look.

    "text": "This is an OK phone. Prior to having this phone, I used to have a Huawei Elate I bought from Bestbuy a month ago for $50.00. Let me tell you that Huawei phone is actually more phone than I needed and I was really happy with it and I can't believe I snagged a good phone for less than a $100.00. About 2 weeks after this, I showed my coordinator my Huawei phone and he said, “Great phone made in China right?” And I said yeah to which my coordinator said,” You know...these Chinese made smartphones are made with a backdrop built right in right?” I said what do you mean?<br /><br />To which he said “Oh yeah, they made this phones with backdoors...To SPY on you as the owner your accounts and hack through your personal information”. This discussion with my coordinator really disturbed me to the point that I went researching on google that night IF my coordinator was just pulling my leg/bluffing me or there's really something serious to what he said. Then 30 minutes later BOOM! And there it was for all it's glory and he was right. Immediately after finding this facts out, I went immediately to amazon to get a smartphone to replace this Chinese made James Bond phone to avoid being spied on so I stumbled upon this phone. Still not happy, I went to YouTube to get reviews about this phone about it's pros and cons and the Bloggers were adamant that this phone is good and bang for the money so I ordered one.<br /><br />2 days later I got and immediately inserted my Cricket Wireless SIM card and It worked instantly. On top of this, I bought this on amazon on a installment payments about $38.00 per month and only 4 payments left to pay. This smartphone happened to have way way more bells and whistle function more than the Huawei phone I bought like fingerprint I.D.detection, facial recognition and Alexa help and I'm very happy with it. Anything Cons about this phone? The phone is twitchy at best and unusable at worst! The worst thing about the camera is that it ALWAYS SAY, &#34;Camera error...Restart the Camera&#34; every single time you use it! This is a NO-NO because this comes in in a crucial moment when you really need to use the camera. I just hope that Motorola fixes this because it's a LIABILITY to them.",

Or, as suggested by the accompanying video, do I put them on my phone before attaching the first, larger magnet? I tried to do an amalgam of different directions, so we'll see when I take it out for a test drive. Shall update after I've used it for a bit.<br /><br />10/26/2022: Alas, this worked a few weeks and then fell off/apart. I think the iPhone XR with my heavy case was too much. Plus, the load was uneven since I placed the magnets towards the bottom to preserve wireless charging capabilities.

I don't have a problem getting my headphones into the jack, and I have no problems using the touch screen through the plastic protection.

The pearl is a dream come true -- it's sleek, thin, a beautiful and comfortable phone, top quality reception, and it even has an MP3 player.<br /><br />The main appeal here is if you want blackberry email capabilities but also have a regular looking phone. One other thing is that blackberry has the best international coverage (on GSM carriers), better than any other email system, so anywhere you go in the world, you've got your email and phone working with no problem.<br /><br />The pearl is especially fast, it's got an intel 312mhz processor, much faster than the tmobile dash and some of the other phones on the market. The keyboard takes getting used to, but it works quite well. It's not for typing long emails, but I think no matter what you need a computer for long documents or emails.<br /><br />This is the phone if you don't want something bulky but don't want emails to pile up that you could quickly respond to throughout the day. Blackberry email is the easiest to set up, it works the best, and this a fantastic and fast phone overall.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:31a74f2743f23eb0aec4a9db9cecd680]] I really like the portrait and landscape mode. It is something that my last gimbal couldn't do and being able to switch between the two modes with a button press is really nice. The magnetic mount is a nice feature and makes it easy to take the phone off and tuck it into a pocket when moving from location to location. This makes the process less fiddly since you can do it before you go out to take pictures and videos. One of the weird things I noticed is that pictures taken through the app seem to be geo tagged in the ocean of the coast of China. This is weird and I'm not sure how to correct this. I can only assume it's baked into the software somewhere, but odd nevertheless.<br />Some negatives, at least when using an S10E or other android phone, the app is not available on the Google play store. The inability to download the app easily is a big con as it makes updates and initial use more difficult. If you're not familiar with allowing APK downloads from internet sources then this alone might be enough to deter you.  I have another Chinese made gimbal and their app is their so I feel like DJI should be able to get that sorted. That being said, I have several of their products and it's been like this for over a year. You can use the gimbal without the app, but you lose the feature to take photos and interact with the phone through the controls. The zoom/focus knob is extremely sensitive when paired with my phone. It's absolutely unusable and I had to disable it. An occasional bump into it would cause it to try to zoom in or out, not even turning it was required to trigger it. It would be nice if you were able to adjust sensitivity in the app or map it to a different feature all together. Personally, the extendable feature feels a little gimmicky. When I brought it on vacation, I rarely extended it and found it unnecessary in most situations. Taking a selfie was the only exception where it was nice to have, but even then, I was able to extend my arm in widescreen mode and fit people in without issue.<br /><br />Overall, I do like it when compared to my old gimbal. You'll be able to hear my old one in the unboxing video, the motors are much louder when compared to the DJI one. You can't even make them out and that is a big plus. I would say build quality is 5 stars and if you are looking for a great brand name gimbal DJI is hard to beat. If you want to upgrade from last generation I would say don't bother. It sits at 4 stars for me since it really doesn't play as nice with Android, but Apple people will have completely different experience. If I can get my hands on an iPhone I will update my review with that experience.",

It's not perfect, but it's still an extremely competitive option at a reasonable price. The charger takes around 3 hours and 15 minutes to charge when using a USB C or Micro USB and lightning takes about 3 hours and 30 minutes. This is when using a fast charger. When using a standard charger, it can up to 5 hours and 45 minutes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The charger can tell you what voltage and current it's charging a device at or what it's being charged at.<br />  Just press the power button to cycle through voltage, current and remaining capacity.<br />The ability to fast charge it with every modern cable (USB Type C, Micro USB and Lightning) is amazing<br />  and guarantees you will be able to get a new charging cable easily.<br />Well-built metal enclosure.<br />Wide compatibility fast charging.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Charging 2 phones at once causes both to drop to 5V standard charging speed.<br /><br />Overall, this charger preforms really well when you're using it primarily for one device. I recently took it on vacation, and it was great in the plane as well as charging my phone in the rental car. I was able to charge my S10E 2 plus times per full charge. I haven't been able to test SCP charging fully since I don't have a phone that uses it, but I plan to get something that can trigger that protocol successfully and test the 5V 4.5A claim. As for now I can confirm that 5V 3A max is going to be the limit for most people. I will update if I have an issue or can confirm the SCP discharge claim.",

    "text": "Update after few more weeks.<br />I wanted to add that while charging with 100w, the reason the charging time was the same as the 90w is because the cell temperature reached the cutoff and throttled back to 60w for both. I ran the test again with the 100w charger, but this time placed it on an ice pack. This allowed it to fully charge in a little over two and a half hours. This at least shows their over temperature protection works but will be the reason you will notice diminishing returns on charging speed when using 60w chargers and above. I also noticed that when the percentage goes below 20 percent or so the 18W USB-A port no longer steps up past 5V.<br /><br />Original:<br />This is my second high power portable charger (100w output), and I can safely say if you don't need all the bells and whistles, this is a great choice. The other one I reviewed cost more than twice the amount and this one can do almost everything it could do. It even has a low power feature that is nice. I know longevity is yet to be seen, but I do like the charger so far.<br /><br />The low power mode allows you to lock the unit on and effectively power devices with low current draw. I can keep an Arduino powered as well as other devices that only take around 20ma at idle. The voltage output is stable and consistent even under load. I like that this charger supports passthrough charging. Like the manual says, if both USB-C ports are in use then they are each capped at 60w. This includes passthrough mode. The manual is good and has all the information you need. I noticed a that it does say a long 2 second press switches the USB-C port from input to output, but I was unable to get that to work. That feature isn't really an issue for me and not something I would use, but if you have that desire then this might not work for your needs. It can charge a MacBook Pro without a problem, and I didn't notice it getting excessively hot while charging it. The carrying bag is nice and the cable provided is good quality that can handle 100W of charging power.<br /><br />Capacity and Charging:<br />At 5v 3A I was getting around 84.7Wh, but when I went to 20v 1.5A the capacity was closer to the expected at about 90Wh. I noticed the best efficiency was through the 18W USB-A port. With a 12v 1.5A test reaching 92Wh. This is very close to the rated capacity and when charging, it took in about 115-120Wh. My charging was done with a 90W and 100W charger. This took a little over 3 hours for the 90w and a little under 3 hours for the 100w. This is consistent with my other portable charger of the same size. As a disclaimer, capacity is never going to be exactly what the packaging says and after testing dozens of portable chargers, I have only had a few meet or exceed the rated capacity. To another reviewer's point, this does not get to the 99.16Wh.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's a great portable charger and comparable to other in size for this capacity and power output. It would be great for anything from hobbyists needing a power source for their low power projects or for some that travels and needs to charge a laptop on the go. If I have any issues with it I will update the review but as for now it's great.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:56882bb10ee32d598de1d18bcc5f2c88]] Let me just start off by saying this is a beast. It has amazing efficiency and awesome capabilities. I know the price of it might scare off most, but if you are looking for a compact power bank that can do it all, then this is an excellent option.<br /><br />The ability to charge anything from my MacBook Pro to an old S8 makes it the perfect fit for anyone that needs to work in areas they often find themselves without an outlet. The OLED display is easy to read and has the necessary information most would want. The information it's missing is output protocol being used and temps. Those would be nice for a portable charger nerd like myself, but I understand some might not care.<br /><br />Capacity tests I have run are promising and show a very efficient conversion rate. When running through a few discharge tests at different voltages, I can get 90-95Wh out which is very close to the 99.16Wh the pack holds. So, with energy loss taken into account, this portable charger tests above average.<br /><br />Charging tests that I have done were with 90w and 100w chargers, but if I see enough interest, I can test charging speeds with a slower charger. That being said, expect around 3 hours to charge the unit. The fastest I was able to charge was at 2 hours and 58 minutes. It takes about 120Wh to charge the pack so there is a little more energy loss on the charging side compared to the discharging side.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this charger. The price isn't for everyone and this range there are a lot of good competitors. I would like to see a little more configuration available to the user and with the updatable firmware it would be possible. The support teams are very responsive and quick to answer any question you have. Ultimately, there are cheaper options that don't have an OLED screen and if that doesn't interest you then save the money and go with them. For me it's a keeper since the more information the better.",

    "text": "TL;DR:<br />This charger is dense. It is compact yes, but do not think compact means light weight. It weighs a little over half a pound (.66lbs). This is lighter than my other 20,000mAh chargers, but it does deliver slightly less capacity than those. It's cost efficient compared to other and works well with a few limitations. It can charge my S8 over 4 times with power still left. Comes with a USB-A to Type C cable and an oddly included USB-A to micro-USB cable (I would have preferred Type C to Type C). I have included some pictures comparing it in size to my smallest 10,000mAh pack along with a few others.<br /><br />Performance:<br />This charger claims 20,000mAh and after testing a lot of portable chargers I know that does not mean you can charger a 4,000mAh battery 4 times. Most brands give capacity at the packs battery voltage and this one is no different. After testing at 12v, 9v and 5v I have an idea of what capacity you can expect.<br /><br />12v @ 1.5A = 4,923mAh<br />9v @ 2.0A = 6,505mAh<br />5v @ 3.0A = 12,178mAh<br /><br />This was done at max supported current for the given voltage on USB-A port 2. I do not have a huge issue with these numbers since it has a circuit that is ~82% efficient at converting power at 5v. It is not that much worse than my other packs and when you consider the size it is a fair tradeoff. The problem I have is they overrepresent the product in certain categories. First off, the product cannot output 5A at 4.5v like it states in the manual. I do not know if this was a typo or just overconfidence, but after about 3A the voltage sag is tremendous. I have included photos to show this. My other complaint is I was unable to charge at 12v on any of the 5+ chargers I own, and this was using multiple cables. It is more annoying to say it does and then does not than to just say you can only charge at 5v and 9v like a lot of other power banks I have.<br /><br />Charge times from empty:<br />PD Charger (USB Type C to Type C)<br />9v @ 2A = 6hrs<br />Non-PD Charger (Supplied USB-A to Type C)<br />5v @ 2.9A = 7hrs 23min<br />9.2v @ 2A = 5hrs 36min<br /><br />Quality:<br />I have never heard of this brand and the packaging looks like a supplier mass produces these and the brand slaps their name on it. That being said, it feels well made. The plastic case is sturdy and made with good quality plastic that should handle a drop or two. The 4-dot led display is nice and will glow green when fast charging or discharging. This is a nice feature if you want to know if you are in a higher voltage fast charge mode or only at 5v. The cables supplied are not the highest quality, but it's not a big deal if you already have a cable you like. I am interested to see how the batter holds up since it looks to be a LiPo in the pictures and I have had issues with those in the past.<br /><br />Overall:<br />For the price it's an excellent choice and I would recommend this if you are looking for something around 20,000mAh. I don't know how long it will hold up, but I will keep using it and update this review if I have a failure with the pack.",

    "text": "This is a very small but capable charger. It is well build and is the smallest 10,000mAh charger I have tested. I have been using this charger for a month now and I can say it has been very reliable. It doesn't lower its output current as it gets close to being fully drained and is comparable to a wall charger for phones that don't use more than 18w. I really like it ability to charge the power bank using something similar to Samsung AFC. The only downside I have notices is that the PD charge controller is limited to 2.4A instead of the 3A stated on the product and in the manual. I would say most people wouldn't notice this and most device would likely switch to a higher voltage at that point. You can only see it when charging the device with USB Type C cables using a 3A capable charger. The cable provided is nice and usable, but I wish it came with a USB Type C to Type C cable in addition to the Type A to Type C cable provided.<br /><br />Capacity:<br />The usable capacity of the charger is about 6,500mAh or a more usable number of 33Wh. I would look more at (Wh) for a fair comparison because many modern devices charge at different voltages which affects the mAh observed. It can charge a standard phone at least 2 times with the potential to do a third time on some phones.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />Good and compact although it can be tricky to get the charger out. The packaging was also activating the charger because of how snug of a fit it was.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good and small portable charger. It would be great for both Android phone users as well as the iPhone crowd.",

    "text": "This charger has some very nice features and does exactly what you would expect from a wireless car charger.<br /><br />The phone that I was using to test this was a Galaxy S8, which supports 10w wireless charging. I can say this charger was able to get close to that with peaks of 9.4w observed. The automatic feature of the charger is very convenient although it will be interesting to see how it holds up. I have tried this charger with a larger phone (iPhone 8 plus) and the charger has just enough space for it, but it does work. I would be careful when placing the ball mount into the socket and I recommend doing so when the plastic is warm or at least at room temperature to avoid one of the 4 clamps breaking. Trust me, I have had it happen with other mounts.<br /><br />Mount Options:<br />The mounts included are nice, but the vent one is a bit bulky. It will not work in my vents, but I haven't found a mount that will work so I'm not really upset about this. The suction cup is nice, but I know from experience with other suction cup mounts they will fail in really hot or really cold temperatures. I have will be using this in another car that the vent mount will work and print a cup holder mount for my main car.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I'm happy with this charger and will be using it on my hour plus drive to work. I will update this review if the product fails.",

    "text": "This portable charger isn't perfect, but for most people it would be an excellent choice.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The box is very nicely designed and gives a lot of details about the charger. The box was beat up but the charger was undamaged. The two in one charger is great and my only complaint is it didn't come with a protective sleeve.<br /><br />Main Unit:<br />It has a premium feel and is one of my nicer chargers. I have reviewed a lot and own a lot. This has quickly become one of my favorite chargers. The phone I use it with is a Samsung Galaxy S8, but I have tested it with the iPhone 7, 8 and the Essential PH-1. This is where some issues appear. The charger works great on the Samsung and iPhones (using USB-A port), but the PH-1 had issues charging at the 18w rated. I have observed the USC type C port having difficulties with the Power Delivery standard not only when charging other devices, but when being used to charge the pack. I can't get it to charge at 12v like it is supposed to. I have bought a few PD chargers purely to test this as well as some of the best cables that available. This lets it charge itself close to 18w at 9v, but it needed the better cable. I have also noticed if I charge my S8 from the QC port then plug in a device to the USB type C port the charger resets. The screen turns off and the phones momentarily stop charging. The charger resumes charging, but doesn't always return to 9v charging on the S8. This is the biggest and only problem I have found so far.<br /><br />Capacity:<br />To start I would like to give the adjusted capacity of the pack. 10000mah after conversion from 3.7v to 5v should give 7400mah total capacity. Using a 2amp 5v draw, I was able to get a around 6700mah average. This is actually good and has a conversion efficiency of ~91%. This is what you should expect when charging an iPhone from the USB-A port, but if you charge a phone that uses QC or PD then you can expect much lower capacity since the voltage can go up to 12v which will lower the effective capacity to ~3000mah before conversion loss. When charging my S8 with QC I get about 4600mah of useful capacity.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I would recommend this charger for its build quality and price. Since I have bought this at 22.99 I have seen this charger drop to 12.99 for the grey model and 19.99 for the blue one. At that price it would be hard to find a charger that does as well as this does in the price range. I only gave it 4 stars due to the issues I faced charging with PD, and if you have Pixel you might have a different experience then I did. I look forward to testing more of their chargers and I hope their quality continues into their 20000mah model with hopeful improvement to PD charging. If I have any issues that develop I will update this post and let you all know.",

Mounting is fine although the adhesive is strong enough to make removing it a pain. However positioning the ball takes some forethought and cannot be used on all cars. Ideally, the mounts should be placed on a vertical surface on the dashboard. This should allow for the greatest amounts of viewing angle possible. On top of a dashboard surface does not allow the phone to rotate to a comfortable viewing angle. This was unfortunate because my car does not have a good vertical surface for the amounts to be placed on. Also, having a magnet on the back of my phone was not s an ideal situation. It makes it a hassle to put in and out of a pocketand also I fear that  I will accidentally put the phone near my wallet which will erase my credit cards. As a results I decided to go with a different mounts that simply has a metal plate to go on the phone case and a magnet that is only on the mounting arm. I would have liked for this mount to work, for its looks alone. but unfortunately it did not for me.",

The screen is brighter without the built-in shield on the defender, and the Commuter package comes with a self-adhering screen protector separately. The outer plastic shell is pretty slick, but I've had no issues with losing my grip. It allows for easier transition into and out of my pocket than the Defender.

It is small and light allowing it to be mounted on the sun visor without affecting the visor's ability to stay in the up position. Sound quality is adequate for conversations and the volume can be set quite high. Music playback quality is atrocious and I'm not sure why Jabra even included this feature on this product. The microphone works well and picks up speech a normal conversational volume whether the visor is up or down. There is no need to strain or shout to be heard. The batteries last an incredibly long time and I have gone for about 2 months between charges regardless of temperature levels. Pairing the phone is very easy and reliable. The unit shuts off after awhile if not paired to a device; however, will turn back on and pair to the phone automatically when entering the car. A motion sensor lets the unit know when you enter the car and to shut down a few minutes the Bluetooth connection is severed. One thing that is really annoying is the range of the Bluetooth antenna on this thing. My phone stays connected for over half a block after I exit the car. If I park too close to the house and get a call I am yelling hello without realizing that the speaker in the car has maintained the connection to my phone. I don't think Jabra needs to have such a long range antenna for a unit that will be used within the confines of a car. Overall, I have been happy with this product.",

So not free by any means.<br /><br />A very good phone with a few negatives.  Closer to a four than a three.  I currently have been using IPhones for 5 years.  My current one is a 6s.  With many new android  phones showing promise, and the ever increasing cost of IPhones, I wanted to update my Android skills.  This Vine item presented that opportunity.<br /><br />Easy to transfer many items from my IPhone to this phone, using the cloud setting. Smoother than I thought.<br />Android system has improved tremendously from the awkward system that caused me to go to the IPhone.<br /><br />Review of the hardware.<br /><br />Well made phone that looks more expensive than it is.  Looks as good as the Iphones.<br />Clear display.  Very good color,  good layout.<br />I rate the speakers on a par with the much more expensive IPhones.  I listen to music frequently, via , Iheart, Amazon Vine music.<br />Quality sound is important to me.  I rate the sound quality of music through the speakers as excellent.<br /><br />Cons.<br /><br />No case available?  I should say, there are no reviews of the few cases available.  I tried using generic cases, but they blocked part of the speakers, which are front facing, top and bottom.  With a case, a solid 4.  Without, a shaky 3.5.  I did post a question to the Amazon community asking if anyone had found a good case.  There were no responses.  I realize many users don't care about a case.  I do.<br /><br />A number of reviews have compared this model to the previous Idols.  I have not had previous models and can't make the comparison.<br /><br />The fingerprint sensor is placed on the rear of phone, which I find awkward.  The IPhone  has it on the front.  That makes  more sense to me. I can see if the sensor is reading my print.  Can't do that when it's on the rear.<br /><br />I took identical photos using my wife's IPhone 7 plus, and the Idol 5s.  The Idol photos had a washed out look.  That surprised me given the good pixel count, and good color display.  The photos were taken on a cloudy day, with no direct sunlight.  The IPhone 7 plus did cost $ 769.<br /><br />If getting good photos, rather than great photos does the trick, you will be happy with this phone.  When I said the photos were washed out, they were being compared to photos taken by a much more expensive phone.  They are fine for Facebook posting, sharing, and satisfying most needs. If playing music through the phone's speakers is important, you will enjoy  this phone.",

For those that don't know, the case comes with a dummy phone which is inserted into the case, and which you submerge in water for 30 minutes.  I would be concerned if I used this on a raft in a pool.  For my usage, it is not a problem.  I don't use it in situations where a waterproof case is a necessity. In addition, the IPhone 7 is reasonably waterproof.  Consumer Reports verified this. In summary, I like the case.  The removal tool is great.  Miserable to remove some cases.  This is a snap.

    "text": "Belkin makes good products.  The band looks attractive in gray.  Somewhat thick.  There are a large number of holes so it will fit most wrists.<br /><br />This is painted leather. Also called protected leather.  That is the type found in leather furniture in most homes as it's affordable and stands up well.  Paint protects. I would expect it to be warm on a sweaty wrist, as it won't breathe.  It is a nice band for the money.<br /><br />Reason for deducting a star.  Recently purchased 2 Apple watches.  One had an Apple Modern Buckle, the other a classic buckle.  I compared the Belkin to these.<br /><br />The Modern Buckle sells for $ 249 on the Apple Web Site. It has a magnetic clasp.  Unfortunately, it had  a limited number of holes, and is sold in 3 wrist sizes, all 38 mm.  It came with the watch, and it was too big for my wife's wrist.  She gave me the band.  I wore it for 5 days, and the leather is very thin, strong, light and soft.  Doesn't feel like you're wearing a watch. Because it's not painted leather, water will probably stain it over time. The Belkin feels heavy in comparison. You know you are wearing a watch.  Don't think the Modern Buckle is worth $ 249 though.<br /><br />The other watch came with the classic buckle, and sells in the Apple stores for $ 149.  Definitely less stately than the Modern buckle, but a nice enough leather.  Felt nice on the skin.<br /><br />My wife then decided to order the Hermes Single Tour watchband from the Apple website. Beautiful classic look in a good choice of rich colors. She previously wanted to order the Hermes Apple watch.  None to try on where we live.  We were going to Vegas for a week, so she expected to buy one there. Just came back from a vacation in Vegas.  Only the Hermes flagship store at Shops of Crystal carried it, and was sold out.  Though $ 339 for the Hermes band sounds expensive, it's no contest between the Hermes and the Apple Modern Buckle.  Well worth the extra $ 90 for the Hermes.<br /><br />Summarizing.<br /><br />The Belkin gives excellent value for the money.  Fit the watch perfectly, buckled well, and I'm not afraid of losing the watch, due to a faulty band. Also a good band to wear if you expect a wet day.",

Both are nice.  Buy BookBook only from a very reliable source, as it is a heavily counterfeited item.  The Iphone fits snugly into the wood frame.  I think the wood adds class.  The case is a single color, and plainer looking than I expected.  Not at all like the Book Book.  The leather looks rich, and the phone's sound comes through clearly.  The strap adds class, but I'm not sure about its longevity. I forget my wallet a lot (retired), but never my phone.  I keep my license, and one credit card in the case.  Who needs cash?  The P&Q is unlikely to be counterfeited due to the wood frame inside.<br /><br />The Book Book looks more than a designer item, while the P&Q looks like a mini address book.<br />I got free shipping ordering directly from P&Q.  Discount codes/clearance pricing  available on a few items.<br />Kindle touch anyone.  They have a really great discount on that one.<br /><br />Finally- and important.  With the new ATT (others) cellphone plans, where there is an excellent discount if you have your own out of contract phone, there is great incentive to protect your phone in a good case. I was getting a new phone every 2 years.  Now I hope to keep ours for 4 years.  That makes these pricier cases a better value.",

    "text": "I got this case to protect the watch during certain activities - primarily rock climbing.  I wanted a case that could be installed and removed easily and repeatedly because I want to use it just a few times per week.  It's a two-piece unit.  You have to take off the band, install the back piece, and then press the front piece onto the back piece.  There are little rubber tabs that go from the back to the front.  The biggest problem with using it for this purpose is that it very quickly became impossible to get the little tabs to line up, and therefore impossible to get it securely installed on the watch.  I think I was happy with ease of installation the first time or two, and then after that, it became much harder to use.<br /><br />In my opinion, if it's going to be that hard to install, it should work really well.  It doesn't.  It doesn't fit well on the watch (Series 2 aluminum using Apple original &#34;sport band&#34;).  It doesn't cover the crown.  And after just a few install-remove uses, the tabs don't line up, so it's constantly falling off.<br /><br />And good heavens is it ugly.  It protrudes in every direction and the material quality is really poor... so it makes a great-looking product into a cheap-looking product.  It looks like a $10 sport watch.<br /><br />I am now going to try the Orzly InvisiCase, also bought from Amazon.  So far, all I can say for the InvisiCase is that it is much faster to install and it looks much better.  A case only works if you use it.  I'm going to use the Orzly and I am not going to use the Spigen (because it is frustrating to try to install it and it doesn't stay on).",

It's a little annoying to have to have to connect and disconnect my cable through the bottom of the hole and into my phone, especially since it tends to fall out since there's nothing to keep it in place. However, it serves my purpose, did not cost a fortune, and was the best option I could find at the time. I really like the sleek metallic look and feel. It definitely does NOT look cheap in any way.

I can also close the cover while talking. It's clean looking and not bulky.

If you flip the phone in landscape with the bottom charger plugged in on the left or right side if felt more stable. I think overall it doesn't take up too much room, but needs more weight on the bottom to make it sturdier. If it even had a way to mount it on the wall, that would make it easier with charging and sturdiness. The price is good for what it is.",

I know, this is a $10 case, so I can't expect an otterbox level of protection, even if that's what I was secretly hoping for. The case arrived today, and I finally just opened it up, and placed my at&t note 3 inside.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed in dismantling the case to place the phone inside, was just how cheap the rubber outter layer felt. I feel very certain that if I am not careful, it will easily tear, rendering the rest of the case useless. The second thing I noticed was how flimsy the entire inner shell feels, I mean, again, for $10 what can you really expect? I'll be putting this case through the paces for the next week or two, but I almost guarantee that after even one drop, it's going to be done, and you'll need another case. My advice? Spend the extra $20 if you can swing it, and just get the otterbox defender instead. I have had nothing but positive experiences with otterbox products. I chose this case because money is tight at the moment, but after feeling how flimsy the case, and it's built in screen protector are, I almost feel as though I would have been better off carrying the phone nude in my pocket instead. All this case does, and this is the only upside in my opinion, is adds a pleasant amount of &#34;chunk&#34; to the phone, making it feel more like an old original gameboy in size,  and making it slightly more comfortable to hold.<br /><br />Tl;dr:<br /><br />I have regrets.",

    "text": "I bought this phone from Amazon in February 2020 for $500, and so far I would say it fell short of my expectations of what a $500 phone from a major brand like LG should be.<br /><br />Battery life: when the phone was brand new the battery life would get me through a 12 hour day with plenty of phone use with some battery to spare. It wasn't phenomenal but definitely was not insufficient, it was within expectations. Unfortunately I did notice a rapid decline in battery longevity and only months later the battery was only good for 6-10 hours without a charge. And I don't mean constant use I mean using it on and off throughout a regular day.<br /><br />Fingerprint sensor is nearly worthless because any amount of dust, oil, condensation will require 7 attempts before success, unfortunately the phone locks you out after 5. . .<br /><br />Face recognition worked very well but what is the point when it requires mandatory fingerprint or pattern unlock nearly half the time, why have the face option in the first place?<br /><br />One of the springs for the MP3 port got stuck within a month, and not from abuse. Now it won't hold an mp3 plug enough for headphones or speakers to work.<br /><br />After a year the charging port does not hold much pressure, but this degrade was at least slow amd consistent and within normal expectations.<br /><br />Complaints: The constant requirement of fingerprint instead of allowing face recognition, and requiring pattern unlock instead of accepting fingerprint recognition . . . why even bother with the convenient unlock options if the phone doesn't unlock the phone without requiring a less convenient one half the time! I got into a serious accident on a ski slope and had to get someone's attention from the side of a ditch to get them to call ski patrol because I couldn't get into my phone because it wouldn't take face unlock and my mobility was no longer good enough for pattern. . .<br /><br />The keyboard learns nonsense words like \"tge\" and saves them, and gives no option whatsoever to delete them from the phone's memory, the phone no longer corrects any common mispelling and I have no way to fix this other than installing obnoxious second-hand keyboard apps.<br /><br />Front camera has no zoom and doesn't focus on what I want, then takes pictures when I don't want to because I click the screen two times too quickly trying to adjust the focus of the camera. Camera quality is acceptable, not great and not embarrassing.<br /><br />One big complaint is that I always have screen rotation turned off but the phone allows itself to rotate in certain apps despite this. I'm sure this has to do with the app and not this phone but it really ticks me off.<br /><br />Microphone on speaker isn't great, people often have to ask me to repeat something or speak up, even though I don't use a phone case and am speaking into the phone.<br /><br />I guess overall this phone has deteriorated faster than I wanted it to in terms of battery life and ports, and some of the system features that come in the phone really sap my energy like the security features (I have turned off screenlock because of this) and the keyboard memory.<br /><br />What I do like about it is that it never ever ever lags from hardware, only from internet connection.  Screen is great, music is touted to be good but I'm a regular listener I can't tell any difference, speed is great, and the phone mostly meets my expectations, would have been great with better software.<br /><br />Overall 6.8/10<br /><br />If the mp3 port didn't fail in a month (I don't abuse ports) and the battery didn't go downhill so fast I would call this a great value. Warranty claims are very difficult to perform and they will charge you fees if they think the phone is too damaged upon arrival, but don't specify what constitutes damage (scratches vs cracks.)",

    "text": "I really love this case!  I have been in a love hate relationship with my Galaxy S9+ since I got it several months ago.  I am not crazy about the buttons on the side, they seem way to sensitive and not in the best locations.  They are easy to accidentally trigger.  The screen is awesome, but the screen protector I bought with the phone wasn't cutting it.<br /><br />Then I got my YouMaker case!  The case makes the phone fit very comfortably in my hand, and the built in screen protector is great!  The kickstand feature, in both portrait and landscape viewing angles, make using the phone on my desk a joy.  I will admit that separating the case the first few times is tough, but if you search on YouTube for a how to video, it will become clear.  I actually used a guitar pick to help separate the case cover so that you can open the case and install your phone.  It also does not interfere with my wireless charging station, which I had heard was an issue for some cases.  Not this one. it works great.  Best cell phone case I have ever owned!",

Truth be told, it is so sleek that I question its ability to protect. I'm not willing to test it out either, so I will happily update my review if the protection is lacking. The case is lined in a soft pink felt-like fabric, which is an improvement to the more expensive Kate Spade case I had purchased at the cellular dealer.  The shipping (with Amazon) was quick. Inside the packaging was a coupon code for 20% off another purchase using the AKNA website.  I look forward to purchasing more of these in the future.<br /><br />Update:  8/12/16 PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU PURCHASE THROUGH AKNA on Amazon (or their own website). I just purchased a second case because I love the first so much but it is a knockoff. The original case is super high quality. This one is not. Photos of knockoff to be included.  Please compare all the other user photos. The case purchased from another seller was horrible quality and took almost a month to get here with no tracking information. Do your research and read reviews. This is not the real quality of these amazing cases.<br /><br />On a lighter note, just ordered another case two days ago and it's here and real. :). Love this company.<br /><br />Beautiful case number two! Real case is shown with Maddy 🐶",

It comes  with a attachment for your phone and it even fits a iphone11 with the outer box on it, something I was a bit worried about it when I first used it. It also comes with a Bluetooth remote that really comes in handy when you need both hands or want to take a group photo with you in it.

In order to put my phone into the grips I have to use both hands, one to pry the grips apart and the other to put the phone in. I've used cheaper versions in the past that would let you lock open the grips and would lock into place with a button that would be pressed by the back of the phone when inserted. The other drawback was the wobbling when driving. Maybe it's a common phenomenon of these types of mounts, but it's quite noticeable with the Belkin dash mount. I appreciated the inclusion of the mount pad as well as the option to use my windshield, but either option led to the same amount of screen wobble.

    "text": "I want to like this case as it has what I am looking for in a phone case. It has complete protection for the screen and the phone itself without the need for a separate screen protector. The case has 3 components to it, the hard plastic inner shell which prevents any immediate damage to the phone itself. After the hard plastic casing is in place, the softer rubber part of the case fits over that and snaps into place better than some less expensive cases I've tried. The feel of the softer case is great, you will not feel like you will drop the case once this is installed. If you have small hands, and can hold the S5 by itself, with this case you may not. This case adds a lot of width to the S5, which was already a big phone and almost makes this as big as the Galaxy Note with this case on. I can still easily access the fingerprint scanner, camera, speaker and USB plug. The buttons remain responsive and easy to click on both sides. I use the headphone jack quite frequently, so I would have to assume that continually removing the flap to access the headphone jack might cause it to wear down over time. The front portion of the case has a significant border that keeps the phones screen from being anywhere near the surface underneath it, but again, this bulk is noticeable. I prefer to use a phone case that has a belt clip available and the belt clip that comes with this case is very sturdy. The phone clicks solidly into place and is unlikely to accidentally fall out while on a belt. Overall this case does have everything I'm looking for: protection, added grip, and a belt holster. The added bulk however is a concern for me that even with larger hands it does change the size of the phone in a noticeable manner.",

Will not try the dropping features, etc, just to test it out, thanks. There is no screen cover, and none of the cases I have tried so far has had any. Our old phone lived in an Otterbox, and there was always air bubbles under the screen cover, so perhaps this is why so few have this feature anymore.  Never really knew what the old phone looked like, whenever it would get removed from the case, it would seem like Darth Vader without his mask.  These new phones are so nice looking, and want to have the color, so we like this case pretty well so far.  All in all, this is an overall good case.",

    "text": "I would have broken so many phones without these cases. According to Amazon, this is my 14th candyshell. I've been using them for 10 years, meaning they last an average of about 8 months for me.  The plastic at the bottom with holes for the speaker, etc. always cracks eventually.  I'm ridiculously hard on phones (clumsy), and the phone almost always survives. These are really, really protective cases, and not as clumsy and huge as an otterbox or lifeproof case.<br /><br />A few things I've learned:<br /><br />1. You can go to realspeck.com to make sure it's not counterfeit. This one (from seller GoodPoints Electronics) is real.<br />2. This is not a good case if you change them out a lot. It fits very snugly, and really wants to stay on.<br />3. For a few colors/batches, the rubber ring around the face is soft and rubs away, leaving little shavings everywhere and greasy scum on the screen. I've seen it maybe twice times in 10 years. It's not new, but it's not common.<br /><br />Overall, if you're the kind of person who's likely to drop your phone down an elevator shaft (like me) or out of a moving car (also me), you can't beat a solid candyshell.",

Probably just sell it to someone else and hopefully purchase another one that is better. It was 39.99 the deal of the day plus tax. Glad that I didn't pay over this amount! Should of had been 25.00 to be honest. Just my opinion! Hopefully you all don't have this experience.",

    "title": "LOVE IT, LOW BATTERY LIFE",
    "text": "I upgraded from a smart phone and wanted a phone to view web pgs in html format(which my code wouldn't do), and i also wanted navigation.  Of course you buy a phone to use as a phone and this one I think is great. Great clarity in the call, so far no dropped calls.  This phone has exceeded all my expectations and has so much more. Purchased it at a corporate metro store and phone was up and running when I walked out. Easy to read and for the most part easy to transition to.  I don't consider myself a tech person and I was able to get the basics down in one day. Used the navigation to go somewhere touristy for fun and it did excellent. Oh and love the voice to text feature!  surprisingly accurate, but please proof read before sending. Ha ha its not perfect. The only reason I don't give this phone a 5 star rating is battery life is a must for a phone, and this little beast is more than just a phone. It's a power packed mini computer which uses its energy. I ran low on on battery life because I forgot to recharge the night before, and it only made it through half the day the next day. I blame myself for the mishap; but I was also using it for several functions too.  I am able get about 3-4 hrs battery life using all the functions: camera, web surfing, email, facebook, app.games, phone, txt, etc... and 5-6 hrs if i used it for primarily texting and phone use only. camera takes beautiful pics and gorilla glass is awesome. web pages load awesomely fast with a dual processor and the option to switch to wi-fi is nice too.  I'm really happy with this phone as long as i can keep it charged. solutions for the battery issues: either purchase an extra battery to have on hand or make sure you have a charger for car and home!  Fyi, my connect is not a prepaid, it is a standard lg connect. so the phone bills either way.",

The case fit well and provided coverage all around the phone and comes up the top so if the phone were to fall forward, the case would prevent the screen from hitting the surface directly.  The case is a beautiful rose gold color on the sides.  The back is translucent so you see your original case through the back.  The Mandela design is also in rose gold and is beautiful with the crystal accents.  The case is thin and allows chargers to be used without needing to remove the case.

It's very lightweight and doesn't take up too much space.<br /><br />The tripod is wonderful! I'm used to carrying around a very heavy Manfrotto, so I'm 100% satisfied with the weight and size of it. It even comes with a bag to carry it in! The quality is up to par. It's very steady at all heights, and is extremely easy to raise/lower.<br /><br />Setup is a breeze, as the instructions are very clear.<br /><br />My phone fits perfectly. A larger phone clip is included in case your phone doesn't fit in the standard one, and I think that's a very nice feature.<br /><br />I'm so thankful for the remote! It works with the camera app on my phone just fine. I even figured out that I can use it with apps like SC by using the iPhone button (I have an Android phone). That's a HUGE plus for me!<br /><br />I also use this with my DSLR and I capture great pictures. I'll update this review when I've taken more photos.",

I got both a great price and a quality product. The light has 3 different tones, all of which have 10 (I think) levels of brightness. All of the tones and brightness levels are beautiful, crisp and greatly improve photos and videos.<br /><br />The tripod is sturdy and lightweight. I needed a lightweight tripod for the light because my camera tripod and other camera accessories weigh me down enough. The tripod has a built-in level, and I think that is a nice added feature. I had no idea that it was on the tripod until I took it out of the box, so it was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The phone clip is very study and holds my phone perfectly. There is another phone clip included just in case your phone doesn't fit in the standard one, and I appreciate the fact that it is included because it's one less thing one has to buy if needed.<br /><br />The cord is a good length. The controls on the cord allow you to turn the light on/off and change the tone/intensity (brightness). I have to say that I do wish that the +/- buttons were next to one another instead of the button to switch the tone being in the middle of them. I'll get used to it, though!<br /><br />It comes with a nice carrying case for both the ring light and the tripod.",

A water bottle with a carabiner clip and my phone in my hand.  It worked, but after dropping my phone a few times I started to look for something in which to put it.  Tried cross-body bags, a fanny pack and some other stuff, none of it satisfactory.<br /><br />Then, I saw this phone belt clip holster and ordered it post haste.  It works a charm.  Keeps my phone safe and I just clip it to my belt.  So easy, so nice.<br /><br />I have a big Moto phone and it fits beautifully, so it will fit any phone.  Any.

The snaky part of the holder can be adjusted to any angle and has a nice extension aspect.  It can fit into any cup holder.  The side clips hold my phone securely (something the carabiner hair elastic sometimes did not) and it can instantly be adjusted from portrait to landscape viewing.<br /><br />You really cannot beat the price for the high quality of this car phone holder.

    "text": "Updated 01-04-2021:<br />Well, once I actually began to attach the lanyard I was able to understand how it works.  Out went the hook and loop tape idea; too bulky, not reliable enough.<br /><br />The adhesive attachment is placed inside your phone case, directly to the shiny back of your phone.  Sure, it took me a bit of time, as the instructions are four photos with a single line of text in several languages for each step.  So, now the lanyard sticky patch is inside my phone, with the loop poking out of my case, adjacent to the slot used to charge the phone.  Discrete, strong and quite amazing.  Trips to fetch the mail or downstairs no longer involve needing some big pocket in which to carry my phone.<br /><br />This is a genius phone holder/carry-er.<br /><br />Until I saw this, I had tried to make things to hold my phone from my body, but with no real success.  This works exactly as described.<br /><br />The adhesive strip holds.<br />The lanyard part is nice and thick, so the weight of your phone (mine seems to weight tons) will not stress your neck.<br />The lanyard can be adjusted to any comfortable length for you.<br />Kind of looks nice, too.<br /><br />The only issue I had was that I did not want my phone attached to the lanyard all the time, nor did I feel like detaching the part that sticks to your phone.  So, what I did was to use a small length of hook and loop adhesive tape so that I could disconnect my phone from the lanyard with a bit more ease.  And, who knows, perhaps that will eventually show some disadvantages as well, and it might be easier to simply use the detachable adhesive part.  Time will tell, but I can tell you that this phone-holding lanyard is a game changer when you are moving around doing stuff and do not want to be holding your phone all the time or carrying it in a pouch or something.<br /><br />Really useful tool for staying connected whilst busy doing things.",

I could fit credit cards, my license, and some tissues in there if needed.  It is nicely built and looks nice enough to use to go out. It's more casual than formal.  The strap is a nice length for me to use as a crossbody bag. There is no way to adjust the strap length that I could find unless you tie a knot in the strap.  The clasps on each side do not fit through the loops.  On other bags, the loops were big enough to pull the clasp through and attach it to the other side.

Only reason I chose Galaxy S5 was for the TV remote control but got far far more than expected.<br /><br />I've learned how to utilize the security system and find \"Pattern\", provides great medium level security. The \"Fingerprint\", appears to have a few bugs so I'll stick with Pattern as a means of security for now.<br /><br /> Having a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, and an existing Gmail address made upgrading via Sprint.com smooth and easy.

The magnetic closure is strong and it has an auto sleep/wake feature. The blue cover is a lovely turquoise. The plastic shell backing that you snap your Kindle into shows through when you're reading - it's a blue plastic bumper around the edge of the Kindle.<br />I also love the strap!

The edges do have a tendency to chip as described in the packaging. Makes sense - it's glass! I have a tiny chip on the edge / side of the screen protector but it's not a big deal - doesn't affect the usage.

Like the flex case they all fit well and my MetroCard is snug and secure, I haven't had anything fall out yet! :)<br />I think this case is a vast improvement over the flex case. Wish that it came in more color options.<br />I have it on a black iPhone 5 and it looks ok, but would look better on a while iPhone.<br />There is some scratching on the back as others have noted, but nothing too bad - you only see it if you're looking for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Part of the rubber/plastic on the back of the case started to come off after about 5-6 months. I thought that it was just normal wear and tear but decided to contact Speck anyway. They were fantastic - I sent the old case to them and they sent me a brand new replacement case.

This particular phone, apparently the 'international version' is exactly the same except that it comes with a set of Sony headphones. The pink color is more rose gold than pink - a really striking finish. I cannot say enough about the quality of this device, particularly its camera. The operating system is lightening fast and the platform is very user friendly (coming from an iPhone). I like the memory card and dual SIM option as well. An additional plus to this device is that it is made in Japan. The downside of this device is the amount of bloatware apps that cannot be deleted but merely disabled.

I wound up spending 20 minutes struggling to get the layer onto my phone screen per the directions and when I couldn't get it to stick to my phone I finally figured out why - despite feeling like the adhesive side was still attached to the yellow guide, it WASN'T. By then the gel pad was dried out and the &#34;correct&#34; adhesive side had dust specks that cannot be removed without creating even more marks on the protector. I am beyond livid at the poor design of this application method and directions.<br />As a result I have wasted $15 and it is completely UNUSABLE. Their claim of a lifetime guarantee doesn't cover their poor directions so I'm off to the Apple Store. At least I know their screen protectors WORK. And for the same money I'll have spares.

    "text": "I cannot tell you how happy I am with this screen protector.  I always dreaded putting screen protectors on, because of dust getting under, or not being able to line it up correctly, etc.  But this otter box screen protector took care of everything.  It comes with a microfiber clot and screen wipes- just like any other good screen protector, but the difference with this one is the installation box that it's in.  Whoever designed this needs a raise, because this made the installation SO easy!  The box adjusts to the size of your phone, and you just drop it in.  I cleaned the screen with the wipes and the cloth, removed the protector on the screen protector that is attached to the box, and just lowered it down over the phone, and it snapped into place!<br />Never have I ever installed a screen protector in one go.  I've always had to lift it up once or twice (or even three times more- which at that point I've given up and have decided to live with the dust under the protector), because of dust or because I didn't position it correctly.<br />The screen is clear, and there are no issues at all with the touch screen with this protector. I love that it blocks blue light.<br /><br />This protector is absolutely worth its higher price in my opinion. The fact alone that it rids you of the stress of installing is worth it to me.  Time will tell how durable the protector is.  I tend to have to repurchase screen protectors every 2-3 months from me cracking them because I always drop my phone. But I've always used cheaper protectors, so I have high hopes with this one!  Will update.",

I figured this phone holder would be the solution since it's attached to the rearview mirror.<br />The piece itself seems pretty sturdy, I didn't feel like I needed to be very careful with it when I went to clip it onto the back of my rearview mirror.  Set up is very easy, after adjusting the width to fit the mirror, just squeeze the back tabs on each side together, and clip it on. After that, I shorted the front latches so that the holder was secured tightly to my mirror.<br />My phone clips on easily, and I like that I can pull it down or up and rotate it. What I don't like is that the extension that holds my phone shakes when I'm driving.  If my car didn't have bluetooth hookup and I couldn't use my gps on there, I would probably return this because there is no way I would be able to follow my gps on my phone if it was attached to this phone holder, because the screen gets waaay too shaky and unreadable when I'm driving on the highway.<br />Verdict: For the price, it's alright.  Would I go out of my way to purchase this again if this one ever needs to be replaced?  No.  I only plan to use this holder until the end of the winter, and then I'll be going back to my tried and true ac vent clip magnetic phone holder.",

The inside of the case is the same material as the outside edges of the phone case. The only thing that bugged me about this case was that arrived with scuffs all along the back of it where the harder plastic is installed.  If you look carefully, the plastic piece slopes down slightly to where it meets the combo edge material. It's hard to take a photo of it, but I tried my best.  For the price, this is not a dealbreaker, but it is something I wanted to mention if this kind of thing bothers some.<br />The screen protectors are mediocre.  They didn't arrive with any installation kits, thankfully I have quite a few from past protectors that give you multiple!  You definitely won't be able to install the screen protectors as is, and expect a flawless application.  So, with the help of an installation kit I had on hand, I applied the protector to the front screen and camera at back.<br />So, let's talk about durability.  I dropped my phone for the first time while I was kneeling down to pick something up.  The phone case protected my phone's body from any visible damages.  The screen protector also protected my screen, as it cracked while protecting my screen.<br />At the end of the day, would I buy this again?  Probably not.  It bugs me that it doesn't come with an installation kit.  If you aren't like me and have a few on hand, you're kind of left on your own to find supplies.  The case coming with scratches and scuffs already would also prevent me from wanting to order another in the future.  But, for the price it does offer quite a bit.  Not the best, but enough to get you by.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:49e02b64d0f7dfb9417e86fdb5e2b2a9]] Alright, so I didn't realize that I would need a compatible MagSafe iPhone case to use with this.  As soon as I got it, I clipped it onto my air vent with ease and went to attach my phone to it, only for it not to hold at all.  I thought that my flexible clear case wouldn't obstruct the magnetic hold, but it did.  I wanted to make sure that the magnet on the holder did indeed work, so I pulled off my case and my phone slapped onto it right away.  Now, call me crazy but I'm not going to go around with a case-less phone so that I can use this thing- especially if it might fall off while I drive.  So, I went and ordered a MagSafe iPhone case and it works perfectly.<br />Charging power: The fast charging isn't as good as others that I have.<br />Magnet: Good.  You do need to position it straight so that it magnetizes.  For example, you can't expect it to attach while you're holding your phone sideways or diagonal to the holder.  It has fallen ONCE, on a very bumpy road I was driving down.  I wasn't driving fast (40 mph), so as mentioned in the earlier part of my post- I'm happy I got a case.<br />Sturdiness:  Seems okay, I don't feel like I need to be very gentle with it.",

    "text": "This stand is nice and compact, and it folds up which makes it great for taking with me to work.<br />It's lightweight, but very sturdy.  I don't feel like I need to handle it delicately.  It adjusts smoothly (love the adjustable height), and holds my iPhone 11 easily.  I have the larger iPads, so I don't feel comfortable putting that on there, not because I think the stand will fall over- the base of the stand is weighted and very stable, but because it's a very narrow stand, and I'm too clumsy of a person to have it on there without knocking my iPad off.",

The listing didn't indicate that only one set of cleaning supplies would come, so I didn't even think that it wouldn't come with two.  Other screen protector sets I've gotten in the past have offered this, and they're not much more in price than this one, if not the same.",

I placed on my dash board over 2 weeks ago without any problems. It is easy to adjust and the buttons allow for easy release of my phone. Definitely recommend for drivers that need to be hands free but need to view their phones for directions or anything else.",

I put it on with ease but lost touch sensitivity with my screen.<br />I would purchase this again just for the case alone because I LOVE it.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Have had this for a while now and basically still love it.<br />There is one issue that has happened since I first reviewed this.<br />The stand does not hold up well and a piece broke off.<br />I have still been using it and has thought about buying another one but not sure I want to spend more money if the stand is just going to brake again.<br />The stand still works, because only a piece broke off but it takes away from the look and does not seat as secure when not using it.<br />Like I said I just have to decide if I want to buy a new one, because what if this happened again?<br />I am not throwing this thing around at all.
