It was hard to remove and the buttons were hard to press through the case. I recently switched to the Galaxy S4 and this case and I love it. They made all the right changes to the S3 case to make it perfect. Now it is easy to take on and off of the phone and the buttons are way easier to push through the soft gray part of the case. This one also has a textured hard white cover that has more grip to it than the S3 model. I am very pleased.<br /><br />After the white and gray version wore out, I purchased the PINK AND GRAY VERSION, WHICH APPEAR TO BE A KNOCK OFF or have some other manufacturing error AND DO NOT FIT THE PHONE CORRECTLY! The cut outs in the pink part of the case do not fit the ports on the phone, which has caused all of the micro-usb metal inserts to be bent on every single one of my charging cords! Finally, one of the prongs on the inside of my phone broke and IT KILLED THE ENTIRE PHONE'S ABILITY TO CHARGE!!! DO NOT BUY THE PINK AND GRAY CASE IT WILL RUIN YOUR PHONE! I was a dedicated Otter Box user before this, but I can't take the risk of this happening again so I have switched to a different brand. Sorry Otter Box.",

It hasn't gotten even the smallest scratch and the case absorbs the shock really well. It has two components, the grey soft case and then the white hard shell that fits over the gray part. It was very sturdy and doesn't slip off easily, and the soft gray part of the case has little \"doors\" that open over the ports for the charger and usb. The doors are the perfect size. The outer hard case is also easy to clean, I just use Windex and everything comes right off (not like rubber cases that get a greasy feel after a while). The screen protector meets the edge of the case so no harm can be done to the phone anywhere and dirt doesn't get stuck inside. As for cons, the buttons are hard to push and I have to use the hard edge of my finger nail to push them through the Otterbox case. No more powering on and off quickly or hurrying to turn your ringer volume down at work. Also this case is VERY difficult to remove. It's great because I know the case won't slip off my phone and leave it unprotected. But if you have to take out your battery and reset a glitchy phone it can be quite the project. On only my 2nd try of removing the case to get to the phone battery, the white shell cracked. I was being careful and had already broken 2 finger nails trying to remove it. The case still works just fine and clamps on to the inner soft case so it's not that big of a deal. But at one point I was actually afraid I would damage my phone trying to get the case off, and obviously the warranty won't cover me if that happens.",

The package also comes with a lint/felt screen cleaner cloth and a card to work out the bubbles from the screen protector when you apply it. They also send you a link to a You Tube video to watch that helped enormously, and it shows you how to apply it like a pro and go without the bubbles. The screen protectors also have perfect little cut outs for the &#34;home&#34; button at the bottom and camera/speaker functions at the top.",

My only criticism is that the USB cable did not work with the speakers in my SUV for whatever reason and I couldn't figure out what the problem was. Then I decided to purchase an AUX cable for my iPhone and that did the trick. Listening through the car speakers is a lot better than the phone! What's nice is that I can also charge my phone through the ROAV while it's connected. This is such a great thing to have in the car on road trips since you can do just about anything in the car that you can at home: play music (free), podcasts, get weather, navigation and games. The only feature that it doesn't seem to have is the &#34;drop in&#34; one and that's fine. I still have to figure out how to have her call my contacts since it didn't work. I'm sure that's just a setting that I haven't figure out yet.",

This phone can't deliver on that. I personally feel that this phone is great for the beginners at cell phone technology. They need the basic stuff because they don't do a lot of networking or even use computers much. They are content with being able to make and receive calls, looking up information here and there and texting. I am a boomer. But I have a lot of tech background. I like my laptops, pc's and tablets to work fast and not cause me issues. This phone is fine with my husband. He just plays a game (that is right A game), checks his email from time to time, looks at facebook when he is at a restaurant. He seldom texts. This is a perfect phone for someone like him. He used to rely on his older cell phones throughout the years, but h has slipped with all of the new technology. I think when he left the phone company years ago, he gave up on the technology. He has had an iphone 7 plus and he still can't figure that phone out. For people like him, this phone is perfection.",

It doesn't meet the case from end to end or side to side, but enough is covered to give it some protection. This is a sturdy case. I can see the dark green of the new phone easily in the back.",

I have already tried the video recording and I have to say, it is superior to the iPhone. Same with pictures. It is a challenge getting used to Android after having used iPhone for many years. I had an iPhone SE before the 7+. All I will need to do next is transfer service from the iPhone to the XZ2 and I will be all ready to go. Because the phone is so new, there aren't a lot of cases available for it. And I did find one on Amazon. I don't want the front or back scratched. I keep my cell phones safe always. Besides the video and picture improvement, the sound is great too. Surround sound. On your phone! One thing I definitely like on the iPhone that isn't on this phone, is the larger alphabet/numeric keyboard. On the Sony, I have a difficult time getting to the period and the @ on the phone. An additional part I am not too keen on, is that Sprint does not have the ability to activate this phone. But that is on Sprint, not Sony.",

The case fits well and it locks - similar to Otterbox waterproof cases, but maybe thinner. Because they are thin, some tempered glass screen protectors may prevent the case from fitting properly and If that happens, then it would be useless. You want your case to fit exactly so that you will get the most waterproof protection from the case.",

In order to use this, I have to remove my case - not really a problem because I can still stash my phone in my wallet and the lens in my pocket - just an inconvenience since my case magnetically attaches to the inside of my wallet. Anyway, I attached this to my computer and charged it up. I downloaded the app and attached it to my phone and to my surprise, the lens goes on the bottom of the phone and is attached to my phone via the lightning connector. So, I made my first video. It captured well and it was of high quality - but i got a lot of my hand in the video. I will definitely need to work more on filming with this little baby. It comes with a clear plastic case and a charging cord. One thing I did notice, is that your phone will get a bit warm. This gives you more options on capturing videos.",

To put the case on, you pull it apart at the white and black points. It easily separates. You put your phone in and put it together to hold the phone. Make sure it has clicked together or you may find yourself having to pick up a couple of pieces. This design has class and looks luxury. It feels good in your hand.

I looked high and low to determine what phone this was for. I read the description. The title has it named as Snow Lizard Products SLXtreme7. Not necessarily a clue there either, the 7 could be for their numbering system. No where does it say it is for an iPhone. The only place to find out that it is for an iPhone 7 only is in the Compare to Similar Items area. The only other area is in the detailed description which lists &#34;1 Hour Sun exposure = 10 minutes talk time restored to iPhone from case charge&#34;. Again, which iPhone? I noticed I was not the only person who had this issue as several people had to ask. Since I have an iPhone 7 plus, I am unable to use this rugged piece of equipment, but from having other rugged, waterproof cases, I would say this is a good one to have.",

This could have caused me a lot of anxiety if it had leaked, but I am anxiety free and currently water testing the case for my iPhone 7+. No, the phone is not in that one - I learned from not reading the directions and realizing I could have ruined my phone. This SE case is working beautifully. I am currently charging the phone for the girl to use. I am taking it to the beach with me and I want to make sure it doesn't get ruined. This case works and I am glad I got one for my SE iPhone and my iPhone 7+. UPDATE: the first week of use, the protective shield on the front of the case detached, rendering it useless for the protection needed around water.",

I have spoken to countless individuals who agree that an Apple engineer would easily be able to create such a thing. Since 2006 I've hoped for such a creation and I plan to continue to keep the hope alive. This is a fantastic remedy for a problem Apple needs to address. If you're looking for a hard protective all encompassing armor this product is halfway there.

Also like how it has its own power if you have a car that cuts off the cigarette adaptor with key. They thought of everything, and I appreciate the details.<br /><br />Modern looks without going overboard with blue leds or anything like that, thank you! The green release buttons are diffused and dont bother my eyes at night at all.<br /><br />Its great I just drop the phone it aligns and tightens and charging starts instantly, when you grab it off your fingers rest on the release button naturally on both sides of phone as well. So to release its simple and you don't even really think of the button at all.<br /><br />Went from the one touch iottie 2 to this and wow, worth the wait skipping all the other models for this. Worth every penny paid.<br /><br />Now only time will tell on the durability, if this lasts as long as my one touch 2 then i'm happy as can be.",

    "text": "Overall: So this lens package for the price is decent if you are trying to do still photography, but you probably want to save your money if you are trying to shoot video.<br /><br />The Good: The macro lens is legit and will get you super close up shots for details on still photography. The kaleidoscope lens was, surprisingly, the most useful of the bunch for some creative cinematography.  The fish eye does do it's job, though not needed very often. The ND filter does work if you need to colorgrade your shot in camera a bit.<br />The Bad: the wide angle is no big deal— only slightly wider than a normal phone camera shot— I had ti take a video with it both on and off and then play it back to be able to see the difference: It's minute. The telephoto lens was primarily the reason I was buying this package, hoping to get a nice depth-of-field and rack focus effect on some video footage I was shooting. Unfortunately, the telephoto does not have a focus capability. The lens twists about a fraction of a mm and this results in the tiniest change in focus — though you will get a very shallow depth of field. Again, still photography this is fine. You cannot change focus from one subject to another on a different plane either in the background or foreground. In the end it is pretty much another macro lens that you can use from a few feet away, rather than being right on top of your subject. Unfortunately, trying to follow a moving subject while shooting video with a lens that close up that can't adjust it's focus is pretty much useless.",

FYI: I had to replace my last Speck ink case ( on my iPhone 6) after about 20 months, only because the rubber parts where the headphone and lighting port were getting frayed.

No need to fuss with making sure you place the protector in exactly the right spot, you just snap on the applicator and drop the screen protector into it.  It ensures its placed properly.<br /><br />Sidenote; seller sent me a one pack instead of a two pack, but one quick email and they sent out the two pack as well, not asking for the first item to be sent back.<br />Would purchase this again.",

For example, we take a lot of photos and I love the fact that you can program the phone to take photos at the shake of a wrist, instead of having to touch a button, so you are always camera ready. The Left Side of the Screen is an awesome feature that I use daily to keep up on Google News, which you can customize to your liking and tastes, such weather, work and home traffic reports, and news that you care about. I also really like that this phone is based on Google and not Apple. I have Apple for everything else, but this phone has made me only want to purchase a Google phone in the future. I love the apps that are available and it is not pretentious like Apple products and my phone has been running perfectly without any glitches for three years straight. I also have all of my photos and videos automatically uploaded to my Google Photo account, which is an awesome way to back up everything to the computer with zero effort. This is just a great phone that is so user-friendly and I recommend it to anyone looking to switch phones or get a new one because everyone that has taken my advice has been super happy.",

The company was really great to work with when I had ordering questions. The cover is extremely durable and snaps on very securely. I replace it about once a year due to yellowing issues because the white turns a bit discolored from regular wear and tear. However, the cost is right and can easily be replaced.
