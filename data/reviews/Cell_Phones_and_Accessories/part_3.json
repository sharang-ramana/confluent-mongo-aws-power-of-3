The device basically comes in two pieces. There's an antenna that needs to be installed either on the roof or a tall pole. The other part stays inside the house. The hardest part of the installation is finding the right spot for the outside antenna. Once you've mastered that, the rest is cake. I consistently only got a bar or two except for one spot in the house. This device made an immediate improvement. I don't get full bars, but it's enough to take calls and have people be able to actually hear me. If you should happen to need to contact customer service, they're excellent and very patient. If you don't have a landline at home, this is a good investment. I HIGHLY recommend this device.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

This one has not done that.  Still fits like it was day one.<br />Absolutely love the pattern on this particular case, too... not that it is a statement to the durability, but it does look great!<br />Thank you for making the first phone case that I am not disappointed in after a year!",

    "text": "I had a case similar to this one for my iPhone 6 and I really came to appreciate it. It was convenient to have the necessary cards with my phone without having to carry a separate wallet. I wanted a similar case for my iPhone 13 and I found this one. It's not perfect but it answers the need I have and I am happy with it.<br /><br />This is a basic flap case with three card holder and one ID holder. It does add a little bulk to the phone when the phone is in it, but it still fits nicely in my pocket. Contact magnets keep the flap closed so nothing shakes loose.<br /><br />One of the features this case claims is RFID protection. I decided to test that on the card readers at work, which are very sensitive and can read my badge from over a foot away. With my badge in this case the reader could still scan it, but it had to be about 2\" from the sensor before it would pick up. That's on par with the large majority of RFID wallets I have tried. I have seen better, but I have also seen worse. For most people, this is sufficient protection for preventing scans from any practical distance.<br /><br />The case seems to be made well and I haven't noticed any problems with the material separating or being assembled incorrectly. Time will tell how well it holds up.<br /><br />The one area where I think this case could use some improvement is in the number of card pockets. It can hold only a total of 4 credit cards (or 3 + 1 ID card). That may be enough for some, but I need a couple more slots. Adding more would cause the case to add much more bulk, and the flap would not close either, so this is probably as close to perfect as I will find.<br /><br />As I write this, the asking price is about $20, which is reasonable.<br /><br />This is the type of phone case I wanted and it meets the need I have. It looks nice, it holds a few cards for me so I don't need to pack a separate wallet, and it offers basic RFID protection for those cards. The asking price is reasonable too. If you have an iPhone 13 and you want a case that can hold a couple of credit cards, this is one to consider.",

As mentioned I chose the clear case and it is very much that - it is not frosted or opaque like another case I have but is absolutely clear.<br /><br />The case is designed for bumper shocks more than anything and it delivers. It has a thick, semi-pliable bumper guard as well as a fair amount of thickness on the back so your phone is well protected. It does a good job with medium height drops and fumbles and it keeps the phone for getting scratched up when jammed in a pocket of briefcase.<br /><br />The button covers work well and the phone is as operable as if I put no case on it at all. I have had no issues with unresponsive buttons related to this case. The speaker, microphone and lightning ports all line up nicely on the bottom as well and the case does not interfere with any of these. Finally, the case comes to the perimeter of the screen but does not actually touch the screen so it does not interfere with screen covers - I major issue I have seen with a few cheap cases in the past.<br /><br />I am pleased with this case and expect to get years of service from it. It provides good protection for the phone and it does not interfere with the phone's operation at all.",

It has two Type A USB output ports (QC) and one Type C in/out USB port, and it is capable of outputting on all three ports simultaneously. It's small enough to pack in a briefcase or backpack, though it is heavly and bulky enough that it is a little unwieldy in a pocket.<br /><br />The display is nice and bright and shows the remaining charge capacity.<br /><br />It does have an emergeny light that can be turned on and off, and I have seen this type of feature on other banks and have found it to be less than useful most of the time. That said, if you need an emergency light source (albeit a relatively dim one) it is available.<br /><br />The charging speeds are impressive - if the receiving device can handle the speeds. Most devices I have worked with are limited by their own onboard ports and not the device sending the power. If you have a device that can handle a QC input or charges via USB-C, this bank does well. If not, this bank will still charge it but cannot charge it as quickly (in other words, it scales properly).<br /><br />It comes with a nice mesh pouch for carrying and storage.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with this power bank. It works well and has a generous power storage capacity. Being able to charge via USB-C is a big plus if you have a device that can handle the speed.",

It requires a bit of effort to get the phone to snap into it, and once in there's little play between the edges of the case and the phone. This is not a case where the phone will slip out of the case in your pocket and there will be appreciably less dirt in the case as compared to more relaxed-fit cases.<br /><br />The jury is out on how much protection it provides, but it seems to be decent, particularly for the cost.

    "title": "High Capacity at a Great Price Point; Slow to Replenish",
    "text": "I use battery packs like this one to charge my phone all the time; I've learned that plugging my phone into the wall and letting it charge continuously shortens the battery life, while a battery pack cuts off when the charge is finished. This is the highest capacity charger I have seen and used and so far I am happy with it, though I do have one complaint with it.<br /><br />Most packs I have used top out around 10,000mA (some have been higher) and are good enough to charge my phone 3-4 times before needing to be plugged in to replenish. This one is 30,000mA and I believe I can get around 10-12 charges from it before I need to plug it in and charge it back up. That's a huge difference. I say “believe” because I have not drained it all the way to nothing yet, but so far that seems to be about right.<br /><br />This thing has a good-sized solar cell and it helps in keeping the charge up. That said, do not expect it to charge at the same rate via solar cell as it does when it's plugged in. On average I have noticed most solar packs take roughly 4 times longer to charge with just solar as compared to using USB.<br /><br />This unit plugs in via USB-C for charging and this is faster than using MicroUSB. Now that said, this is not a fast-charging device, at least when replenishing the pack. When I received it I immediately plugged it in and it showed it was roughly half charged. It took several hours to reach full capacity. Using the port to charge a tablet the charge speed it fine, though. Being a larger pack it will obviously take longer to charge up than a smaller one, but I was surprised at how long the charge takes, considering the USB-C charging port. Fortunately I have not needed to charge it from empty yet.<br /><br />Included is an LED flashlight bank that is good for emergency use. I don't make a habit of using such, but it's a nice-to-have.<br /><br />One word of caution I offer if you have used other cells like this one – this one is heavier than is typical, which is a function of the capacity due to bigger battery storage. If traveling light is more important than having battery power, this is something to keep in mind. The include carabiner is very helpful and allows for clipping this pack to a backpack, belt or other otherwise unused loop or hook.<br /><br />The price is the big bonus with this pack. I have seen packs that cost more that have less features and less capacity, so this pack is a bargain considering the price point.<br /><br />Other than the slow recharge, this is a great pack that will see a lot of use in my house. I love the capacity and I like that I can leave it on the window sill to keep charging when not in use. The price point is excellent, considering the capacity. If you need capacity and the weight isn't a concern, this is one to definitely consider.",

    "title": "Solid Vent-Based Mounting System",
    "text": "I go through phone mounts for the car at a rate of about one every year. My preference in mounts is actually vent mounts because the AC coming out of the vent keeps the phone cooler (I have had problems with the phone overheating in the car on occasion and mounting over the vent helps tremendously). I have used other Andobil phone mounts and looked to this one to fill the need since my last mount broke. So far I'm pleased with it.<br /><br />This mount is a typical ball/socket mount for the vent, but there are two different vent attachments for it. One is a typical pincer-type that grips via rubber-padded fins that work somewhat like disk brakes. The other is a type I have never before seen and works by a retractable hook designed to hold tight against the back of the vent fin, without a friction grip.<br /><br />The pincer grip works about as expected. It has a wingnut-style tightener that slowly closes the fins together until they form a good, firm grip on one of the fins in the vent. If you haven't worked with this type of mount, I offer a word of caution from experience – do not overtighten, because enough tension will cause the fins to crack and break which ruins the mount.<br /><br />The other mount works on a worm gear style of mechanism (if it's not a worm gear, it works like one). A turning sleeve slowly retracts the hooked arm until it catches and holds snugly against the vent. It has a couple of splayed feet that provide support against either the rest of the vent or the dashboard depending on how it is positioned.<br /><br />From experience with other Andobil mounts, I would recommend putting a drop of lubricating oil on the ball to help prevent the socket from seizing. The rubber gasket in the socket has a tendency to stick to the ball, which is an issue if you want to make an adjustment to the position.<br /><br />The holding bracket for the phone itself is well designed. Some brackets snap open abruptly when opened, but this one opens gently which produces less wear and tear on the inner workings. It accommodates my phone just fine (an older iPhone 6) but it also is large enough to handle larger models without difficulty. The bracket holds securely and I have had no problem with my phone shifting or slipping, even when I have slapped my phone in hastily without paying attention.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice vent mount for the phone. It holds well and it has a different mounting mechanism that seems to work better than the normal pincer type, though it comes with a pincer mount too if that is preferred. If you like vent mounts for the phone (and in my case, such is my very best option), this is one to consider.",

    "text": "I selected this phone mounting system specifically because it comes with a vent mount and I have had problems with my phone getting too hot on the dashboard. The one I had been using broke and could not be repaired so I needed a new one, and this one seemed like a reasonable solution. So far, I am very pleased with it. It seems to be well-made and it holds the phone very well. The cost is a plus as well.<br /><br />There are two ways to mount your phone with this unit – either using the suction mount or with the ventilation mount. Most people will probably use the suction mount, and as far as that goes the suction mount is better than many I have used. The suction cup itself is one of the sticky types that gives it additional adhesion to smooth surfaces, a huge plus when mounting on the windshield. Because of the stickiness, it is a lot less likely to release when the window gets cold in the wintertime. The vent mount is very typical and is a basic pincer mechanism that uses a wingnut/screw to tighten. The good news is that you don't have to choose just one or the other because the ball and socket connector allows for moving the actual harness between the two. So, if you have two vehicles, you only need one unit without needing to move the whole thing and you can leave the suction cup in place.<br /><br />The harness itself works like a standard car mount solution – drop in the phone and squeeze the sides together against the phone. Press a button to make it let go of the phone. Adjust the bottom support bracket for larger phones. This is not rocket science. What is different, though, is that the release is more of a soft mechanism instead of an abrupt open that slams immediately to completely open. When the release button is pressed the harness opens gently. That will reduce stress and wear, though I never had a problem with any harness breaking in the past because of this.<br /><br />I put the phone in the harness, closed the harness snugly and then inverted the whole thing and shook it very vigorously. The phone didn't come out and didn't even wiggle. That's a very good sign that the harness won't accidentally let your phone fall if secured properly. While not a road/vibration test, it is more than enough to make the point that this harness will keep your phone secure.<br /><br />Finally, there's the cost. I have seen a lot of harnesses that are of lower quality that cost more and don't come with the ventilation mount. This one is priced competitively.<br /><br />So far I have zero complaints. I am not a typical user in that I favor the ventilation mount, though the suction mount is well made and will keep your phone secured. The harness is above average and does a very good job of holding the phone in place. And finally, the asking price is very reasonable.",

    "title": "Exceeded My Expectations",
    "text": "I have used a number of different phone holders of different types, but this is the first one I have used that is mounted on the air vent. I have avoided this type of holder up to this point because I did not trust that they would hold well or would constantly force the vent to point downward from the weight of the holder. Summer is upon us, and I have had repeated problems with my phone overheating and shutting down so I decided to try this holder to see if it would help with that problem specifically. Now I wish I had been using this type of holder all along; it has proven to be far and away better than I expected.<br /><br />I will start by saying that my concerns with this type of holder seem to be unfounded. The holder does keep the vent open which is ok, and there is a little bit of play in the vent itself in terms of being able to move the fins, but the holder stays put and when attached properly it holds securely.<br /><br />Most spring-loaded holders with which I have worked use a spring to clamp closed on the devices they hold, but this one works in the opposite way. To close, the clamp must be manually closed and squeezed against the phone to secure the phone, and the button on the holder causes the clamp to pop open. This isn't a problem, it's just different than what I have seen before now.<br /><br />So, with the temperature close to 100 F in the car, I clamped the phone in place and cranked up the AC. I made two important observations. First, the holder was not as disruptive to air flow as I had thought it would be. Yes, it does block a good bit of air from direct flow but it does not close the vent or keep air from flowing, so it did not impact how well the car's AC worked. Second, even with the sun beating down on the phone, the phone was cooled enough by the AC to be cool to the touch and it never shut down on me.<br /><br />This phone holder solved an important issue for me and cleared up some of the misunderstandings I had about air vent mounts. It works well for me and it allows me to keep my phone alive when other solutions failed me. This is an easy product to recommend based on my experience with it.",

This is one of the larger-capacity packs with which I have worked and so far I have not had any issues with it. It appears to be a solid workhorse.<br /><br />At the heart of any of these battery packs is a set of rechargeable batteries, which is where these things get their weight. Generally speaking, the heavier the power bank the more batteries and more capacity the bank possesses. This one is no exception to that. At a capacity of 25,000 mA, this is a bit of a brute and has some heft to it. That said, it is slightly smaller and lighter than most of the higher-capacity units I have used.<br /><br />It's a handsome fellow and looks quite a bit like a smart phone.<br /><br />There are two output ports for charging USB devices. One of them is rated for 5V/1A and the other is at 5V/2.1A. This does not mean that when you plug in a tablet or phone that it will steadily output a full 1A or 2.1A. Putting a USB power meter on the ports when charging my phone on the 1A port, the power fluctuates, especially if I am actually doing things on my phone at the time. When “at rest”, my phone typically draws about 0.5A, but when I open an app or open a web page in the browser, it spikes and will pull quite a bit more but then it settles again.<br /><br />I have not drained this pack completely yet so I am not sure how many charges I can get with it when it comes to my phone. My phone can be charged from dead to 100% on a pack that has a 2,500 mA capacity, so in theory this one should be capable of giving me 10 full charges between needing to be recharged itself. We'll see. It does get my phone charged up relatively quickly, and it shows its own capacity while it is charging so I'll know when it is getting low.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with this battery pack and I am pleased with it.

    "text": "With a couple of iPhones in the house I am always trying to track down lightning cables. I selected these in the hopes that they would be a viable alternative to buying Apple-branded cables. My concern with these cables is that the listing says nothing about MFi certification, so there is no guarantee that the cables will work properly. As it turns out, they work just fine, and the colors make the different cables easy to tell apart (for those of us that have color preferences).<br /><br />Without any indication of certification, I wasn't sure if these cables would work at all, though most uncertified cables I have seen and used have at least permitted the phone to be charged. Only one way to find out – I plugged my phone into my computer using one of the cables. My phone immediately started charging and my computer was able to access the storage in my phone. That's really all there is to it, they work.<br /><br />The cable is shielded in a nylon weave and is terminated on both ends with a hard plastic plug with a sleeve before capping in an aluminum casing. They seem to be made well and hopefully should last a while.<br /><br />The price is good, too, considerably cheaper than Apple-branded cables.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with these cables. They work like they're supposed to work in spite of no certification statement, they're inexpensive and they seem to be made well.",

    "title": "Good Lens, Clip is Passable",
    "text": "I have worked with a number of lenses for phones and I have seen some interesting variations. Some require a special case to work with a phone (and therefore are model-specific) while others use a special clip that clamps over the phone's lens. This one falls into the latter design type and for what it is it's very good, though there is room for a little improvement.<br /><br />There are two main components to this lens. There is the clip to which the lens attaches, and there is the lens itself which is actually a pair of lenses. The clip is a solid and sturdy thing with a strong grip so I will not slip off the phone when in use, a problem I have seen with lenses of this type on occasion. The part that touches the back of the phone has a thin foam pad that provides grip, and the pad has a slight swivel action to it so in theory it will lay flat regardless of the phone's shape. It works in that regard, even with the phone case on.<br /><br />Now, that said, to get this lens to really work I have to take my phone out of its case. That's inconvenient but not a deal breaker for me because my phone case is a simple slip-on case. For those using a more complex case it may prove to be more tedious. There are things that could have been done to make it fit regardless of the case.<br /><br />The lens itself is a two-piece assembly, as many are. When assembled it is a wide-angle lens that enhances the field of view in the shot, especially when zoomed out. When only the base is used, it is a high-magnification macro lens that is great for taking clear pics of things that are very close. In both cases, I have found the images to come out with very little distortion and the images are clear and sharp. For the macro lens test I used my thumb as a test subject and I was able to get good ridge detail on my thumb print.<br /><br />The lens includes a nice cloth bag that keeps it clean and protects it from scratches. It's not much protection against crush damage when the lens is stored in a book bag but it's certainly better than nothing and will keep the lens mostly pristine when on the go.<br /><br />This is a good lens, let down by a basic clamp that could have been better. If you don't mind taking your phone out of the case to use this lens, the lens will serve you well and you'll be rewarded with solid, clear pics.",

    "title": "Strong Suction Cup, Easy to Adjust",
    "text": "I selected this windshield mount to hold a GPS navigator as the suction cup that came with the navigator is weak and has a bad tendency to let go unexpectedly. So far it is working well for me, though admittedly I have not had it very long so there hasn't been a lot of wear and tear on it yet.<br /><br />The main feature of this mount is definitely the suction cup. It's super-sticky and it holds even when the temperature outside drops below freezing. Most regular suction cups have a bad tendency to lose suction and release when it gets cold, usually at the most inconvenient of times. I don't know how cold it has to get before this one will let go, but it's definitely a lower temperature than a typical dry suction cup.<br /><br />The bracket that holds the phone (or in my case the GPS) is designed to be worked with one hand and it works well. It opens easily and snaps closed when a phone is pressed into the bracket. The problem I have had with other brackets like this one is that the foam grips on the brackets have come out and get lost; hopefully this one will not have the same issue, and so far it hasn't been a problem.<br /><br />I like the versatility in adjustments that can be made to get the position right. The arm telescopes out and the height can be positioned just right to either get it out of the way or to put it precisely where it needs to be so it's easily accessible. A word of caution, though – when mounting to the windshield, take care to put the suction cup exactly where you want it, because once it's placed it takes some deliberate effort to move it again. Typical suction cups are much easier to move and often can be shifted with one hand; don't try that with this mount. The only additional adjustment that would make this mount even better would be to have the base on a swivel so the mount can be easily turned. I haven't seen any mounts like that so far.<br /><br />So far I'm happy with this mount. It seems to be holding up well and the suction cup is nice and strong. It's a bit difficult to move once it is mounted though this is one of its strengths. It has other adjustments that make is versatile enough to have limited movement once attached, and getting your device in and out of it is easy. This is easy to recommend based on my experience with it so far.",

    "title": "Best Smartwatch I Have Used So Far!",
    "text": "Many people do not wear watches anymore, as a cell phone is a quick way to get accurate time without consulting a separate time piece that itself requires maintenance. A cell phone is not always convenient to carry though, and personally I prefer wearing an actual watch. This is the first smart watch I have used that I really like, and though I have barely tapped the potential of it I am very pleased with what it does for me so far.<br /><br />I will start with a comment about the company: I have seen very, very consistent quality with ASUS, and for some reason their products are generally more affordable than other big names. Because of the name, I expected (and got) quality right out of the box.<br /><br />This is a very nondescript watch right out of the box. It is very plain-looking and the leather band, while nice, does not stand out for either good or bad reasons. Overall, it is very basic-looking and dull – until you turn it on and start interacting with it, and then it comes into its own.<br /><br />Getting the watch to work properly really requires a Bluetooth-enabled device running either iOS or Android. The application Android Wear is in the store for both operating systems. Note that this means that Windows users are just out of luck. In addition to sending a time sync to the watch, it also allows for setting reminders and alarms as well as mail and voice integration.<br /><br />This particular smart watch has a feature that, to me, makes it worth having in that the face can be changed very easily and quickly. There is a selection of many, many watch faces and it is a snap to change the appearance – just select a face, wait a moment and the face changes to the selection without any fuss. So, if you need something fancy you can set it to that and set it to something more casual later.<br /><br />It has some other settings and functions too, though I have not yet learned how to use and/or access them all. It does keep track of my steps and it tells me when I have reached some milestone but because I have not made any settings changes it is very sensitive and registers my steps when I am riding in the car. It has a slew of other settings too – weather conditions with variances on location, traffic conditions, sports scores and a lot more (and some of them leave me to wonder why I wold want such on my watch).<br /><br />Though there are a lot of functions on this watch, they are all out of the way and are accessible on demand so it is not cluttered like I have seen on some other watches. Even though there are a lot of functions I personally will not use, they're bound to be useful to others and they hurt nothing by being there – and they can be turned off.<br /><br />Charging speed is phenomenal. I have drained the watch down to close to 0% battery and plugged it into the charger, and it is completely ready to go at 100% about an hour later. With modest use, it takes 3-4 days to drain. I really can't complain about power consumption with this watch.<br /><br />This is a very nice watch and it works very well for me. I love being able to change the face on demand and I like the rich feature set even though I have only started to scratch the surface of all it can do. This is presently my watch of choice.",

    "title": "Solid but Expensive Case",
    "text": "I recently added a Droid Turbo 2 phone to my calling plan and I have been looking for a good case for it. That phone was expensive and it was an investment, so I wanted a good case for it to protect it and keep it safe. The Lifeproof case is one I had heard about and I was glad to have an opportunity to test it and see how well it worked for me. So far, it has met my expectations.<br /><br />This is a full-enclosure case that completely covers the phone on all sides, not just a back and bumper guard case. It is all plastic and the material is neither the strongest nor the cheapest plastic, meaning it could be stronger but that would drive the cost up even more. It seals to be waterproof, and it includes the dongle to allow connecting headphones to the audio jack without having to open up the case.<br /><br />I had no problem getting the case on my phone and it sealed up nicely. I am not brave enough to test the case for waterproofing while my phone is in it, but I have been able to demonstrate that the case is very splash resistant and it has kept the phone protected when outside during rainy conditions.<br /><br />The face is a thin plastic layer that does not seem to impact sensitivity. I was a little surprised at first that it is just a plastic membrane, but having dropped the phone and the screen did not crack or scratch I have to assume then that the membrane is to facilitate keeping out water more than anything else. Perhaps it is just me being fussy but I do prefer tempered glass for screen protection.<br /><br />The case includes full instructions on how to install it, maintenance and care.<br /><br />For drops and falls, so far this case has kept the phone free of damage. I have been told it holds up when the phone is dropped from a height of over 20' but I have to question under what circumstances I would have that happen to my phone. The only real negative I can find is the price, as it is far and away more expensive than a good number of other cases I looked at, even though this one definitely provides the most solid protection. If you do not have a problem with the expense and you want a good, solid case that will definitely keep your phone safe, this one is worth consideration.",

    "text": "I have an iPhone 6s and I have a bad tendency to break my screen protectors on said phone. I am loathe to replace them since they tend to be expensive at the store, and they're not something I think to buy when I have one that is not broken. I was given an opportunity to test these screen protectors and they have proven to be worth their salt. These are much more affordable than those you buy at a store and they work just as well.<br /><br />These come in a two-pack which is great news for this clumsy fellow. I have a very bad tendency to drop my phone and invariably the screen gets caught right on the edge and the cracks spider out, so having an extra one close by when I do break one again is a good thing. I presently have one of the two applied to my screen and so far it has held up for a couple of weeks. I have dropped my phone a couple of times but so far the screen protector has held.<br /><br />Application is simple and easy. I am used to seeing alcohol wipes in the package with most protectors, but this package did not have one. Everything you need is in there, though. If you are careful and you follow the directions on the package, you end up with a screen protector that fits right and does not have bubbles. I got it right on the first try.<br /><br />The screen protectors do not cover the curve which I have come to regard as a good thing. Screen protectors that wrap around the edges to the metal actually interfere with some phone cases or vice versa.<br /><br />I do like the anti-fingerprint coating which does a decent job of keeping the screen more visible. I dislike a smudged screen so I like how this screen protector helps. It is not 100% fingerprint-proof but it does cut down the prints quite a lot.<br /><br />So far it has not appreciably diminished sensitivity on the screen either. There is certainly some desensitizing that it brings but it is not enough for me to notice. The screen has remained responsive and clear.<br /><br />I have nothing to criticize when it comes to these screen protectors. They go on easy, they fit right, they do not show every last fingerprint and they are substantially less expensive than what you buy in the stores.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Great Way to Upgrade Your Phone's Camera",
    "text": "With a camera in practically every phone made these days the point-and-shoot camera has become an endangered species. A lot of the cameras in phones are actually quite capable and they do a very good job, but software-driven cameras lack some of the features that are available on more dedicated cameras, like very close-in shots and fish-eye shots. And, unless you have a special case that allows for lenses to be attached and changed, you get just one lens with a phone camera and that's it. This kit works around that and provides a set of optical lenses that work for practically any phone camera.<br /><br />This set of lenses provides four different lenses: a fish-eye lens, a wide-angle lens, a macro lens and a circular polarizing filter (CPL) lens. With the exception of the wide angle lens these are all stand-alone lenses, but the wide angle lens relies on the macro lens to work (this is the normal configuration for this type of lens). Each lens screws into a clip that simply clamps onto the phone, over the phone's built-in lens. It's a simple design and requires no special case or modification to the phone.<br /><br />It should go without saying that the lenses work a little better and you get a better shot when the lenses are close to the phone's built-in lens. I have a battery case on my phone and it holds the clip about 1/4” from the phone lens and these lenses still work well for me, though I do have to adjust and fiddle with the clip to light things up properly. That's not a fault with this specific lens kit, it's a problem with any lens kit if you plan to use it with a thick case.<br /><br />The fish-eye lens it my favorite of the bunch, and it works surprisingly well for a small, clip-on lens. The fish-eye effect is very pronounced with this lens and it is easy to get a very wide angle with it. The wide angle lens is nice and it does capture a wider field of view, though I do not use wide angle lenses even with my dedicated camera so I personally do not have a lot of use for this lens. The macro lens, however is one of the best I have seen, particularly for a clip-on lens, and it does a superb job of getting very close shots. The CPL lens works well too and it is easy to see its effect in testing by pointing it to an LCD screen and turning the lens, and the screen will blacken and come back through the camera. Outdoors this lens does a good job of brightening colors.<br /><br />The lenses come with a nice little carrying bag as well as covers for each individual lens.<br /><br />I am quite pleased with this set and am happy to recommend it. The fish-eye and macro lenses make this set worth the asking price all on their own, but the wide angle lens as well as the CPL are both good in their own right. Overall, this is a very nice set and will definitely enhance the camera in your phone.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at minimal or no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

    "title": "Nice Case, but Not a Snug Fit Along the Short Edges",
    "text": "I have an iPhone 6s and I am pleased with it, and I have been looking for the right accessories for it. I have tried dozens of cases and there are two basic types – cases that protect the phone and cases that are more of a fashion statement. This case is in the former category and it's a nice case overall. I have found one issue with it that is potentially a real problem, though for the moment it is just an irritation.<br /><br />This is an unusual case when compared to many others I have used. It is a two-piece case that most easily goes on the phone in two steps. The main piece is a large rubber shell with squishy bumper protection that makes an excellent shock absorber. Most cases I have used have harder plastic bumper protection or even a metal band, and these are fine but they do not absorb shock as much as something softer. The other part of this case is a hard outer shell that clamps onto the back of the phone and holds the rubber shell in place. If you try to put the whole thing on the phone at once it is quite difficult, but when done one piece at a time it is easy.<br /><br />The case provides soft button covers for the power and volume buttons. These are well placed and seem to work just fine. This is not true of all cases so it is reassuring that this case has the buttons lined up properly. It also has openings for the charging/data port, the speaker and the audio jack. And, the case does not interfere with the vibrate switch.<br /><br />The issue I have with this case is the fit, actually. The case is snug around the long length of the phone which is as it should be. It is loose along the short edges though, enough that bits of debris get in between the case and the phone. On the long edge, the case is tight where the hard shell holds it, but over the buttons it is quite loose like along the short edges. I have not found a workaround for this. The loose fit is the only issue I have found with this case. It's not loose enough to make the case fall off and it does not compromise the protection, but it does open up the possibility of getting dirt under it.<br /><br />This is a nice case and I do like it. It looks nice, it provides good protection and it is affordable. It is not a completely snug fit, though, which is the one flaw I have found with it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at minimal or no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

    "title": "Add Wireless Charging to Your iPhone 6/6s",
    "text": "I am relatively new to the iPhone, having carried one for just about a year after my older phone died. My previous phone came with a special back that allowed for wireless charging, and I have sorely missed it. I was given the opportunity to test with this case for the iPhone 6/6s and it does work very well for wirelessly charging my iPhone. There are a couple of minor issues I have with it but these are not enough to discourage my use of this case.<br /><br />Charging cases in particular serve two purposes – protecting the phone and providing a mechanism for wireless charging. Wireless charging is an excellent feature – no wear and tear on the lightning cable and no fumbling with a cable that almost fits when there's a good case on the phone.<br /><br />For wireless charging I will confess to having some initial disappointment that turned out to be not the fault of the case but the charger. With the phone in the case, I set the phone on the charger and it would start to charge and then stop. It did this repeatedly. I thought it was the case until I tried it with a larger, square charging pad and the case worked flawlessly and my phone charged up fairly quickly. Use this case with a larger wireless charging pad for consistent results.<br /><br />The case charges the phone by snapping to the back of the phone and there is a lightning insert to plug into the phone's lightning port. When fully in place it looks good and the fit is tight – very tight. Getting the phone in the case is no issue, but taking it back out requires some finger strength. This is good and bad at the same time: it is good in that it will not pop off the phone and fit loosely, but it is bad if you want to take the case off for any reason. Plan on exerting some effort if you like to swap your phone case on occasion.<br /><br />In terms of phone protection this case provides basic corner and edge protection. The case frame is very hard and rigid and this is good for preventing corner dents which are more likely to shatter the screen. I would like to have seen more shock absorption in this case on the corners, though, which would add more damage protection for the phone without driving up the cost or interfering with operation. The case does not come with any kind of screen protection other than the bumper guard, so plan on buying a tempered glass screen protector to go with the case. To be fair, very few cases have screen protectors with them so this should not come as a surprise.<br /><br />The main feature of this case is that it can add wireless charging to your iPhone 6/6s, and it does this very well. I am pleased with the charging aspect and I will use this when I am in the office. For protecting the phone, it does an adequate job of corner and edge protection, though a little more shock absorption would be a welcome addition.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Allows for Multiple Intervals",
    "text": "A timer outlet like this one is useful for a number of things, such as setting the coffee pot to go off in the morning just before you get up or for turning a lamp on and off at night to make it look like someone is home when this is not the case. Most of the timer outlets I have seen and used have been simple, analog devices that are pretty easy to set and are mechanical. This is the first digital timer I have seen and used and so far I have had good success with it, save for minor issues.<br /><br />This timer outlet features a large LCD display with the time, day of the week, timer status, mode and whether the timer is set for random mode. It has an internal battery so that it will retain settings during a power outage once it is charged. It has multiple programs that can be set so that it is possible to set the timer to work at the same time every day or to create several different time intervals to power on and off.<br /><br />Setting the timer is mostly easy though I found that setting the time interval worked the exact opposite of what I expected. I contacted the seller and after a discussion with them concluded that I am either reading the instructions incorrectly or reading the timer wrong. Regardless, I have a handle on how to set the timer now and have found a good use for it.<br /><br />I plugged my router into it and used the timer to down the router at a certain time in the night (I have teens – that should explain why I am doing that). I set the timer to shut off my router at midnight and turn it back on at 4am. It did exactly as I had hoped and at midnight the router shut down very abruptly. At 4am it powered back up and worked as expected.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are 10 different programs that can be set so that there is no simple “on at time x, off at time y” setting like with analog timers. Using the various buttons you can set a program to trigger on a certain day, every day, every other day, just weekdays and a lot more. In addition to the day of the week there are buttons to set the hour and minute, turn on random intervals and reset the timer. It's easy to switch between the clock and timers as well.<br /><br />So far this timer has worked out well for me, though there was some learning required when I first started working with it. Now that I have it figured out it does a good job for me and I like it. I had some issues with figuring out the way it determines when there is power supplied to the device and when it cuts power. The number of different programs and how they can be set up is impressive and this timer can do a lot more than the old analog ones can. It's a decent timed outlet worth some consideration.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Good for Daytime Use",
    "text": "I have played with several dash cams and they all tend to work about the same. They are useful for recording events on the road provided you have enough storage in them and they usually have good daytime resolution. The differences are usually in the specific features/capabilities and in the extras in the box. They also can differ when it comes to night vision. This particular camera is good for daytime work, but it suffers at night time with poor imaging in low light situations.<br /><br />This is a nice-looking unit that is about 1/3 the size of my GPS navigator. It comes with the extras you need to get going right away – the suction cup, USB cable, car charger and the memory card. The product description is a little off: it says it comes with an 8GB card, but mine came with a 16GB Class 6 card.<br /><br />The camera has a couple of different modes for capturing images. It can capture HD video (which can be ratcheted down, of course) and it can capture still images. Both of these are useful modes depending on what you are trying to accomplish. Keep in mind that this is no substitute for a regular camera or video camera.<br /><br />I had no trouble mounting it on my windshield in the car and I was able to set it up to record. I particularly like the fact that it can record continuously instead of requiring short clips of fixed sizes (unless you want that). I set it to record continuously and went for a drive, recording the whole trip. The image was clear and bright, though the image was slightly distorted due to the wide-angle lens.<br /><br />Others have had some difficulty with night recording so I tried it after sunset too, and I understand the criticisms. It does not adjust well for night driving. When I upped the exposure enough to get images the colors got funny. So, apparently this camera is not well-suited for night recording though it can be made to work.<br /><br />The menu system is fairly straightforward and it is easy to adjust settings. I was able to tweak exposure levels, resolutions and more.<br /><br />I have noticed that the camera drains the battery faster than it can charge when plugged in. So, even when fully charged up and plugged in it will eventually cut off with a dead battery.<br /><br />This is a neat little dash cam and I like it. It does have a couple of small issues but there have been no deal breakers so far. This is a decent little dash cam that works well – in the daytime.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Much Better than a Standard Charger for QC 2.0 Compliant Devices",
    "text": "Most of the electronic devices in my house do not support the QC 2.0 standard so the majority of devices I have cannot benefit from this charger. However, my son's HTC One M9 does support the standard and the charger that came with his phone does not, so this provided us a good opportunity to test and see how well this charger works and how much better it would perform versus a standard charger. The difference is dramatic and obvious.<br /><br />This is a single-port charger that will work with all manner of USB devices, but it is specifically designed to handle the QC 2.0 standard for devices that can handle it. If a device that does not support the standard is plugged in, it will receive a normal charge which I have been able to demonstrate with my phone. My phone charges at its typical rate when I use this charger. My son's phone is another matter entirely – when we plug it into this charger it charges up in roughly one-third of the time it takes with the charger that came with it.<br /><br />I have not yet put a power meter on this charger to see the difference in output. I will do so when I get the chance and come back to update this review.<br /><br />This is a solid little charger and it compacts for travel. That is, the prongs fold in so the unit can be packed up in a travel bag and is good to go. This is good for my son as he can take a charger with him and leave one at home, so he will not be without a charger.<br /><br />Overall, this charger has worked out well for us. It is definitely much better at charging the QC 2.0 device we have tried with it than other chargers, including the manufacturer's charger. It is small, compact, suitable for travel and it works very well. The price is quite reasonable too, making this a good charger if you have a device that can get the full benefits from it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Well-Made Leather Wallet Case",
    "text": "I have always liked wallet-style cases, as much for the aesthetics but also for the added screen protection that the flap offers the screen. Shieldon makes good wallet cases, and this one is for the iPhone 6/6s. So far, I am pleased with it and have no complaints.<br /><br />The plastic shell fits my phone very well. It is a thin but hard plastic material and it snaps on the phone with minimal effort. It went on easy enough that I was concerned about how well it would hold the phone, but I had a much more difficult time taking my phone back out of the case than I did putting it in. Based on that, I believe it will be a good case that will not let the phone escape from it.<br /><br />The shell is bound to the leather case very well and I was unable to get it to give any without putting enough strain on it to damage the whole. It should be fine for most drops and falls, though like any other leather case there is a limit to how much stress it will handle before it breaks loose.<br /><br />The leather flap has three credit card slots as well as a longer hidden slot for larger things like money. Cards fit in the pockets easily and this is a convenience for when you do not wish to travel with more than just your phone and keys.<br /><br />I looked this case over for blemishes and flaws and found none. The stitching is very tight and straight, the leather itself is pristine and clean and the seams are uniform. I have seen a few cases with loose stitching, but this one is made well.<br /><br />If you prefer wallet cases to traditional shell cases, this is a good one to consider. It is made very well, it fits the phone correctly and it is not overly expensive. Consider this one if you want a nice, wallet-style leather case.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "WaterProof Case for iPhone 6; Impacts Usability",
    "text": "I have looked at a lot of different phone cases for my iPhone 6 and this case is one of the ones I looked at. I was interested in the waterproof aspect of it, but I also was curious to see if it was going to be a solid case that would hold up. I would say it's a good case to a point.<br /><br />This is a full case that completely covers your phone on all sides. It snaps together very stiffly and it is very difficult to pry open again after it has been closed. This is a good sign in that it is not going to accidentally come apart when you need to to stay together most. I am very willing to put up with the tightness in exchange for security for my phone.<br /><br />This is a stiff plastic case and it actually has little flex to it even when it is empty which is good. The plastic is not so hard that I would call it brittle, but it is hard enough that I am curious to see what will happen when it is sufficiently cold and I accidentally drop my phone. I am not sure if the plastic will be brittle when it is cold, though I would hope not.<br /><br />The case has a built-in screen protector and this is a very good feature. I like the fact that there is a screen protector at all, though I would have preferred a tempered glass front instead of just a plastic anti-scratch front. Still, many cases come with no screen protection at all and so I think having the plastic anti-scratch cover is more than most have. Keep in mind that this just protects against scratches and will not help against impact damage.<br /><br />The main feature of this case it waterproofing. In limited testing it does seem to work well in that regard. I am not willing to submit this case (with my phone in it) to a submersion test but I can say it passes a running water test when the ports have been sealed. It likely will be fine in a brief submersion situation though I would get it out of the water as quickly as possible.<br /><br />The waterproofing comes at a price, though. With this particular case, the microphone slot is covered and it interferes with the call. Others with whom I have spoken when my phone is in the case have told me I sound muffled. The plastic screen protector covers the speaker through which you listen as well and there is a very small impact when carrying on a conversation – not enough to interfere, but enough to notice. Also, there is a plastic film over the hole for the camera flash, and it is hard to clean when it gets dirty due to being recessed in the case. This is enough to degrade the effectiveness of said flash.<br /><br />This is not a bad case. It is actually a decent case and it seems to work well for its intended purpose. It does provide good protection for the phone and it is very hard to open once closed, making it very likely to keep the phone secure within. It does interfere with calls, though, and this is something to consider when looking for a waterproof case: it is not easy to get the phone out of the case very quickly, so it might prove a little frustrating when trying to use the phone with this case.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "text": "If you have Apple and Android devices you know the aggravation of having a tangle of separate cables on the desk. Apple does not support the micro USB plug so it needs its own cable. This cable does a lot to help eliminate some clutter and reduce cabling – because of the special converter plug on the end, it can handle both types of interfaces.<br /><br />Without the cap on the micro USB end, this would be a normal USB cable that is in use with almost all other phones. The difference is the cap that converts this cable into a lightning cable when put on the end correctly.<br /><br />Being a non-Apple cable it is important to have MFi certification. This cable is certified and when plugged in to my Apple phone it takes a charge from this cable without any issues at all – no annoying warnings about unauthorized cables.<br /><br />I like that Abusun pout their name right on the cable plug itself so there is no question who made this cable. This is a good thing, as too often I find that manufacturers put no effort into branding their merchandise. When a manufacturer does this, it is a good sign that the manufacturer believes in their product enough to advertise.<br /><br />This is a good cable that fills the need for two separate cables in one.

    "title": "Basic But Effective Bumper Protection for a Decent Price",
    "text": "Having recently purchased on iPhone to replace my Windows phone I have been looking for cases for this that provide good protection against drops and bumps. Most cases provide little for screen protection and those that do are usually marginal at best. I decided to try this phone case by MouseLemur and so far it has worked out well for me. I would recommend getting a tempered glass screen protector to go with it of course, as it offers little in the way of direct screen protection.<br /><br />Most of the damaged screens on smartphones that I have seen have been the result of corner drops. This is the most common kind of accidental damage that a phone will sustain and the corner drop surprisingly effective at actually causing a lot of damage, as the screen bears the brunt of the shock of hitting the ground. A tempered glass screen protector is a good idea for protecting the screen, but in my experience the majority of cases where such a screen protector is important is in impact damage. For really cutting corner drop damage, a good case is much more effective, and really you need a rubber bumper case or a comprehensive case for that kind of damage protection. (Note, I am not saying to not use a tempered glass screen protector, but I am saying that a case is more important.)<br /><br />This case is a mostly clear case, with colors around the edges and corners. The edge and corner rim is a bit thicker than the back so there is more cushion where the phone is likely to make contact with the ground. The idea here is that the case will absorb most of the shock which cuts down the amount of shock that transfers to the screen. Along the bumper are the cutouts and false buttons which are placed correctly and do not interfere with the operation of the phone.<br /><br />I like the clear portion of the case which is nice if you want to see the phone itself instead of a design. This is strictly aesthetics, but it is a consideration nonetheless. I like being able to see my phone as it is an elegant device.<br /><br />It fits my phone snugly which means it is not likely to let the phone slip out. It takes a little effort to get it in the case and it takes a little more to get it back out – a good fit.<br /><br />The big selling point of this case is actually the price. It really is not an expensive case and I have seen more pricey cases that offer less bumper protection.<br /><br />This is a nice bumper case. It is nothing fancy, but it serves a functional role and for that purpose it is designed well. Between the bumper protection, good looks and great price point, this is a good phone case that's worth consideration.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "text": "A screen protector is one of the most important accessories you can have for your smartphone. There are a number of options available for the iPhone 6 Plus, the best ones I know of are tempered glass. This is a tempered glass phone screen protector and it covers the screen from edge to edge, something that not all screen protectors actually do.<br /><br />This is a very thin screen protector, thinner than most of the others I have seen. That said, it is still tempered glass which makes it superior to most of the cheap plastic screen protector sheets I have seen.  Because it is so thin it does flex a bit but do not deliberately bend it as you can snap it in half if you are not careful (I have done this with others).<br /><br />Application of this screen protector is typical. Make sure the phone screen is completely clean, dry and free of any particles of anything. I have issues with dust when I apply these to screens – no matter how clean I get the screen and no matter how careful I have been I almost always have some little bit of something that gets on the screen as I lay down the screen protector. I got lucky this time and came out with a clean application.<br /><br />This is a full edge-to-edge screen protector and leaves no edge around the screen exposed. This is good – I have lost at least one screen protector because of damage that happened right on the edge of the screen and taking a hit on the actual screen itself was s close call. That little bit of added coverage that many screen protectors do not prove can be the difference between a cracked screen and just a cracked screen protector.<br /><br />This screen protector does not interfere with the screen sensitivity. It is very thin, though I have used thinner, and it allows for full sensitivity on the screen. It is also nice and smooth so my finger glides on the surface without issue.<br /><br />The claim is that it is fingerprint-proof. That's not quite right, though it is resistant to getting as dirty as quickly and it is very easy to clean off.<br /><br />I like this screen protector. It's easy to apply, gives good screen coverage and does not interfere with the  operation of the screen.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

The few that do offer screen protectors usually include cheap plastic sheets that are fine for reducing scratches but they do little to prevent shatters from drops or punctures. This screen protector it tempered glass and provides much better protection from gash and drop damage than a plastic protector could ever provide.<br /><br />This is a clear screen protector, not a tinted or privacy screen, and it really has no impact on the screen's clarity or color. It also is smooth to the touch instead of matte finish so your finger slides effortlessly across the screen. To be fair, I do not mind a screen protector that has a slight bit of texture, but those tend to interfere slightly with the sensitivity of the screen.<br /><br />Application of this screen protector is very easy and straightforward, but it does require some preparation. Included are wet and dry cleaning cloths, but I have found that cleaning with a microfiber cable is basically required to get all contaminants off the screen. With the screen cleaned, dried and devoid of link, hair or other little particles I was able to apply the screen protector with almost no issues.<br /><br />Though this screen cover is thicker than any plastic sheet I have used, it is thinner than every other glass sheet I have used for any phone. It has zero impact on sensitivity (well, I don't notice any difference).<br /><br />This is a decent screen protector and it works very well. It is super thin for a glass protector, it's easy to apply and it's very smooth so it doesn't affect using the phone.

    "text": "I grew up always loving music. Even as a youngster I had a radio in my room and listened while doing homework. Music has changes a lot since that time and so has the way we listen to it. Bluetooth headphones, headsets and speakers abound, bringing private wireless listening to most people now. My son has a beanie similar to this one so I was happy to get one for myself. The obvious feature is the inclusion of a Bluetooth receiver and speakers, but it also is a nice beanie that will keep your head nice and warm.<br /><br />This is a knit beanie of unknown material. I am not sure if it is cotton or a blend. I do know it is not actually wool. One thing I noticed right out of the package is that it has a very distinctive smell to it, like it has been stored in an old wooden chest or a closet for a long time – not mildew or must but distinctive and unmistakable.<br /><br />I put this beanie on my head and it was of course a little tight at first. Once I got it adjusted and it had a chance to relax it got very comfortable and warm. The speakers along the rim fit over my ears perfectly and are not uncomfortable, though I am definitely more aware of the control side when wearing this beanie. Even so, this is more comfortable than most on-ear headphones.<br /><br />Pairing the beanie is a non-event. I turned it on and paired to to my phone. It identifies itself as “BT-03S” and it paired and connected easily and without any issues.<br /><br />I turned on the music and it definitely comes through clearly. As the beanie does not fit tightly and the speakers are not pressed tight against the ear, the bass is a little lacking which is to be expected. I did not expect this to have heavy bass and I was right. The bass is a little better than I thought it would be though, but it's a far cry from a set of headphones.<br /><br />The Bluetooth receiver has about a 20' range. I walked about that far from my phone before it started to cut out and stutter. This is very much in the range of reasonable.<br /><br />Controlling the beanie is easy. There are buttons for powering on and off, moving between tracks and raising/lowering volume.<br /><br />This is a nice beanie that makes listening to music a lot more fun and enjoyable. The beanie will keep your head and ears warm, and the music will keep you smiling. If you have a teenager in the house, this makes a good gift idea too.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "text": "Lightning cables are a necessary part of owning an iPhone, iPad or iPod. The problem is that Apple-branded cables are expensive and not all third-party parts are worth buying. I have seen cables that are poorly made with sub-par materials and I have seen some high-end cables too. This three-pack of cables is a no-frills set of cables, but it has one thing that is unusual that makes it very much worth consideration – a lifetime warranty.<br /><br />This is a very inexpensive set of cables, costing (at this time) just $10 for a three-pack. That's about half of what a single Apple-branded cable costs. That alone gave me pause when I ordered – would these be made well enough to hold up over time?<br /><br />They seem to be made well enough. The plug ends are hard molded plastic with no seams so they will not fall apart unless broken or cracked. They have rubber sleeves to help reinforce the connection with the wires which adds some strength when bending. The wires themselves are insulated in tight-fitting plastic that is well-attached to the plugs – I was unable to pull the insulation away from the plugs which would have exposed the wires underneath. This is a no-nonsense design.<br /><br />What makes these cables worth the purchase is the fact that the company offers a lifetime warranty on them. To service a $3 cable will cost the company far more than $3, so they must feel confident that their cables will hold up. They would not stand behind them with a warranty of any kind.<br /><br />As plain cables these are not especially remarkable, good or bad. But, considering that the price per unit is so low, the quality seems to be comparable to Apple-branded cables and the company offers a lifetime warranty, it is hard to ignore these as a viable option, especially if you want more than just one cable.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "text": "Note: There are several different packs of cases offered here. I have the 8-pack and my review is written to reflect such.<br /><br />Having just bought an iPhone 6s I look for accessories that will work with it and especially ones that will protect my investment. I was a little skeptical of an 8-pack of cases that goes for less than $10, but after trying these I think it's a good deal. These offer minimal protection and I would not recommend them for full-time protection of the phone but they do offer more than enough to justify the price per case – at the time of this writing working out to about $1.13 per case.<br /><br />These are about the simplest cases I have seen. They have clear plastic backs and colored bumper guards. They provide everything a case should have – openings for the speaker, audio jack, camera and microphone and button covers that allow one to work the buttons even when in the case. The bumper guard is thin and it offers minimal protection but it is better than nothing. It can mean the difference between a shattered screen when the phone is dropped from a short distance and a screen that remains intact. There is not enough cushion in the bumper guards to help with a bigger drop.<br /><br />The phone snaps in easily and everything is lined up nicely with these cases. The fit is snug and it will definitely keep dirt from getting in, but it is not so tight that putting the phone in or taking it out could be called difficult.<br /><br />These are the most simple and basic of cases. If they were priced as much as $5 per case I would be reluctant to recommend them at all. However at the price they do offer some value and they give you some choice of color based on your mood. If you want minimal protection and you want choices in colors to suit your mood – and you want to keep it inexpensive – these are a great buy. Again, I cannot recommend these as the primary case to use with the phone, but for occasional use and as a fashion accessory they're just fine and are worth the asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Looks Good, Made Well and Protects the Phone",
    "text": "I recently gave up my previous smartphone for an iPhone 6s. The unfortunate part of swapping phones is that it means accessories that worked with the old phone do not necessarily work for the new one. A prime example of this is whatever case you have for the old phone – unless you get the same make and model, the likelihood of the case fitting the new phone is very small at best. This case is one of the available choices for the iPhone 6/6s and I have always favored wallet cases. I have not had it long but so far I am very pleased with it. It looks great, it seems to be made well and it definitely protects my phone.<br /><br />This is a folio style of case, a type that I especially favor as I like the added protection against scratches and gouges that the flap provides for the screen. On the inside of the flap are three credit card pockets and a place for bills though the pocket for bills is not long enough to accommodate cash without folding the money (this is a function of the size of the phone, not a problem with the case). I should mention that this kind of case does add a lot of bulk to the phone in terms of the thickness.<br /><br />I have been trying to figure out what kind of material was used to make this case. There is a leather border around the edges, but the main piece of material is something else, almost like a pressed vinyl or waxed canvas? Is it not clear, but it is a tough material that looks good and provides some padding as well as protection.<br /><br />I snapped my phone into the case and it is a very tight fit. So, I know I do not need to worry about my phone slipping out at an inopportune time. The hard plastic holder provides access to all of the important ports, outputs and buttons, though the button covers are a touch stiff and hard to push – not enough to hinder operation, but definitely more effort is required than when using the buttons directly. The charging/sync cable plugs in without obstruction, but plugging in a 3.5mm headphone jack requires some effort as the case does make connecting headphones with all but the smallest plugs a little more difficult due to how close the plastic molding is to the edge of the port. To me this is a small price to pay.<br /><br />The plastic holder is reinforced on the corners and provides some drop protection. I have seen folio cases that offer little reinforcement there which is ok for short drops as the leather portion of the case does provide a limited amount of protection. It is a small detail but it is important – the extra protection can mean the difference between a cracked screen and a phone with no damage.<br /><br />Many cases do not come with an actual screen protector. This one does. It is a plastic sheet cover for the screen, which for a case like this is fine if you plan to keep it in the case most of the time. If you plan to take it out of the case or use your phone with half-shell cases too, you might instead consider getting a tempered glass screen protector as well.<br /><br />I had my phone in my pocket and went to a local pumpkin farm and spent some time in the barn there. There was dust everywhere and it was hard to breathe. When I left the barn I dug out my phone, and the case had kept is mostly free of dust and debris. That's about all I could ask.<br /><br />I really like this case. It looks good and it protects my phone. It's not really very expensive either. If you like folio cases and you have an iPhone 6/6s, this is a good case that's worth a look.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "text": "We recently had to replace the banana stand we had used for years, after it finally broke. It was a basic plastic device but it did the job. I was much more interested in finding one that would last and looked more substantial than the cheap one we had and I was very pleased to have the opportunity to work with this banana stand. It is far and away better than our old one and I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />Instead of plastic, this is a metal frame banana tree. It is made of steel and is painted a dark brown, almost black. It weighs substantially more than plastic stands and it is definitely stronger. My older stand was all plastic and what eventually gave out was the hook – this will not be an issue with this stand.<br /><br />This is a fairly large banana stand, quite a bit taller than our previous one. It can accommodate even larger bananas and it keeps them off the counter. It is also very solid and steady and does not seen to have any issues with stability, staying stable even when loaded up heavily. My older plastic one had some difficulty with this and would occasionally tumble if we tried to load it up too heavily. It is refreshing to not have to worry about this anymore.<br /><br />Aside from being heavy and stable, this is also an attractive stand and it matches well with modern kitchens as well as country or rustic kitchens.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this banana stand and am happy to recommend it. Don't bother with a plastic stand, get a good one. This is a good one and will serve you well for a long time.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "text": "NOTE: This review is for the bamboo wireless charger.<br /><br />I have a phone that is capable of receiving a wireless charge and it is a feature I use frequently. I like the convenience and I like not having to mess with plugging in USB cables. This is a nice wireless charger that works well and it's attractive too.<br /><br />This is a small charger about the size of a coaster and the outer shell is made of bamboo. I like the grain pattern and how it is laminated together; I count 14 layers of lamination and the layers are very smoothly bonded so that the whole unit feels like it was cut from a single piece.<br /><br />When this charger is plugged in and there is no phone to charge, there is an LED that shines solid green to indicate that it has power. When the phone is placed on the charger the LED switches from solid green to flashing green and blue to show it is delivering a charge.<br /><br />Like most chargers, positioning is important and if the phone is not aligned correctly it will not receive a charge. Fortunately it is easy to get the alignment right and so far I have had no issues with the phone not charging. I have also observed that the charger will not charge the phone when flipped upside-down, so ensure that the charger is right-side up when using.<br /><br />I have observed that this particular charger does not suffer from heat retention as I have seen with other similar chargers, particularly ones with plastic shells. My phone gets warm when it is being charged wirelessly, so I need a charger that does not get hot with the phone. This charger does get slightly warm where the phone sits, but it is not as bad as with some others I have tried so I am satisfied with this charger's performance there.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with this wireless charger. It works well, it looks nice and it does not get as warm as other chargers I have tried.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

I do have a reservation about it though when it comes to practicality. It is very close to ideal, but it misses that mark by just one thing – different connector types.<br /><br />This is a USB cable above all. It is designed to plug into a Type A USB port on one end, and the adapters included give you micro USB connectivity on the other. Herein lies the problem – there are two included adapters, and both of them are the same. Why? This cable would have been a lot more versatile and useful if the adapters were different. That is, why not include a lightning adapter, a wide Apple adapter or the older, larger micro USB interfaces? Instead, this cable becomes a simple micro USB cable and little more.<br /><br />As a micro USB cable, it works just fine. I have been able to charge my phone and transfer data with it which is really all I need.<br /><br />As a USB cable, this is a good one and I am pleased with it. As a cable with changeable adapters on the end, it is a disappointment, not because it does not work but because there is only one single adapter type.

    "title": "Good Grip and Good Heat Protection",
    "text": "Silicone utensils and bakeware are the current trend in home cooking circles and one of the more interesting ideas of late is silicone baking gloves. These replace oven mitts and pot holders and have some very distinct advantages. I have had the privilege of working with this particular set of gloves for a couple of weeks and so far I am very pleased with them.<br /><br />First, these are gloves, not mitts, and that in itself is an advantage when it comes to grip. Because the fingers are all separate, it is easier to grip and hold things that are otherwise more difficult when using mitts. Even something like a dutch oven with handles is easier to pick up with gloves versus mitts.<br /><br />These are made of soft silicone and they are covered all over with little heart-shaped bumps that help improve grip. These are especially useful when picking up things made of glass such as a baking dish, though on things like cast iron this is less impactful.<br /><br />I decided to try something with the gloves to see how well they help with grip and I wore them while cleaning fish. This was a bad idea and it did not work out. The fish was a lot easier to hold without the gloves on. Lesson learned. However, they worked very well when scooping hard-boiled eggs from hot water - I got a good grip on the egg and I avoided scalding my hand, though after a couple of eggs the gloves did start to pass on some of the heat. So, these are fine for a quick dip in boiling water but not sustained work.<br /><br />One big advantage these gloves have over their fibrous or textile–based counterparts is that they are waterproof. Cotton mitts might be comfortable but if you get them wet and pick up something hot it will scorch the glove and burn your hand. That does not happen with these gloves.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with these gloves. They work well, they keep the heat out and they are grippy enough that I can pick up things a lot more easily than if I used mitts.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "text": "We have arrived at the point in technology where most new computers and all tablets have touch screens. The problem with touch screens is that it is all too easy to leave fingerprints on them. These pens come with a rubber stylus on the top which is designed for touch screen use and so far these pens have worked out well for us.<br /><br />These are attractive pens in six pretty colors. The lower half of the pen body is a solid color and the upper half is clear with colored crystalline stones inside. The very top is a rubber stylus and the lower chamber contains an ink cartridge. For their size they are very slightly heavy and they feel absolutely solid. Overall, nice pens.<br /><br />I took one of them and wrote a little bit. The ink came out smooth and I got a nice, clean line with no clumping, no blotting and no skipping. These write very nicely. The ink cartridge within is a little on the small side which is the only disappointment as it means they will run out of ink sooner rather than later.<br /><br />The stylus works very well. We tried these pens on a laptop screen as well as a tablet screen and both devices responded beautifully. I have used other styli that skip and stutter a little because they catch on the surface of the glass; these do not suffer from that problem in my experience. Scrolling was smooth and clean and highlighting text was also effortless.<br /><br />Overall these are really nice pens that double as touchscreen styli. They write smoothly and the stylus does not skip or stutter on the glass which all I could ask for. For those of us with fat fingers, these solve a problem with touchscreens and bring the extra function of ink pens to the table as well.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

Although less of a concern I do not like powering off my phone or turning the volume all the way down all of the time even when I need to silence it.  This little pouch seems to be a good solution.<br /><br />In appearance on the outside this little pouch does not appear to be anything special. It is a nylon weave bag about the size of a business envelope with no remarkable features on the outside. However, on the inside is a pocket made of reflective, tightly woven material that does not appear especially interesting - until you put your phone in there.<br /><br />I have a Nokia phone and I put it in the pouch, in the pocket where the reflective surface would face my phone on both sides. Before I put in my phone I observed that I had a good LTE signal, 3 of 5 bars in my basement. Within 30 seconds of putting my phone in there and partially closing the flap, my signal was gone and the phone was not able to even recognize the service provider to which it should connect. I pulled the phone out and it shot back up to 3 bars immediately.<br /><br />I have not yet had an opportunity to see if it will work to prevent the phone from demagnetizing a hotel key but I will get to do so next month. When that happens I will return here to update my review.<br /><br />This pouch definitely isolates the phone and makes it easy to lturn the phone off without actually turning it off.

    "text": "Even a minimalist phone case that provides basic protection is a good investment. Most of the damage to phones I have seen has been when they have been dropped and they hit on a corner, and as a result the screen shatters. This case provides enough protection to help alleviate that problem and it does so at a very minimal cost.<br /><br />This is a clear half-shell case that protects the sides and back of the phone. It does not offer screen protection but this seems to be becoming the norm anymore. It fits the iPhone 6 very well and provides easy access to the buttons on the sides as well as providing for the audio jack, charging port and speaker on the bottom. There's a cut-out for the camera as well.<br /><br />What is most interesting about this case is that, even though it is somewhat stiff this is a very flexible case. As an experiment I folded it in half (literally - I touched the top of the case to the bottom by folding it like a sheet of paper) and it popped back into shape without a single indicator that it had been treated so, save for my fingerprints. It's a little rigid to fold lengthwise so the sides would touch so I didn't push it.<br /><br />The case is sufficiently flexible and pliable to absorb most drops and jolts. The case should absorb the majority of the shock and protect the phone it holds on the sides, corners and the back. I am not willing to test this on purpose for what should be obvious reasons. That said, when in place with the phone you can push hard on the corners and feel that the case offers some give which will absorb a modest shock.<br /><br />There really is only one negative and it is because of the fact that the case is clear: all dirt, dust, fingerprints and other marks are plainly visible on this case. If this bothers you, be ready to clean it often, but if it does not then there's nothing about which to worry. I won't say this is a big problem, just a point about which to be aware.<br /><br />This is an inexpensive case but it provides some protection for the iPhone 6. If you have limited funds and you want to protect your phone from most drops and bumps, this case is worth a look.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

I had high expectations for this cable and so far it has met those expectations.<br /><br />This cable supports the larger 3.0 USB interface on the device end. Most devices use the mini or micro USB interface so be sure your device needs this specific cable before you buy.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I look for in cables. First, I look for connectors that are attached properly and are unlikely to pull loose or allow the shielding to separate. With this cable, the shielding is part of the plug so there is no concern at all about separation - a good sign. I also look for shielding that is tight and is unlikely to snag or catch on sharp things around my desk or along the edge of the floor, and with this cable the shielding is very tight around the actual cabling.<br /><br />Speed-wise, this cable is very capable of supporting and maintaining USB 3.0 speeds and I have been very pleased with the throughput I get with it. I have it connected to my printer and the printer has been very responsive when I have sent data to it.<br /><br />Though strictly aesthetic, I like the fact that this cable happens to be a dark shade of blue instead of black, white or gray. This makes figuring out where it is connected a lot easier since the other USB 3.0 cables I have are almost all black. I do wish NewLobo had actually put their name on it somewhere as they offer a warranty with the cable, though because it is the only blue one I have it will be easy to identify if it fails.<br /><br />This is a good cable, just as I expected it to be. It has good throughput, it seems to be made very well and the fact that it's blue makes it stand out. It also happens to be inexpensive. If you want a good USB 3.0 cable, and you prefer to keep it inexpensive, this is the cable you need.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Basic Protection for an iPhone 6 on a Budget",
    "text": "A phone case is not just an accessory for your phone, it is an investment to protect your phone. Even a less expensive case can save you a lot of money in repairs later. This is one of those less expensive cases that provides very basic protection for an iPhone 6. Normally I prefer something a little more substantial than this type of case, but this case is targeted for base level protection on a budget and for that purpose it is a fine product.<br /><br />This is a very basic case, a simple rubberized half-shell sleeve that provides protection to the sides and back of the phone. It is sufficient for corner and back drops, though it is not enough to protect against crush damage and it does not protect the screen. This is the kind of case you buy when you expect your phone to be used gently and not exposed to an environment where it is more likely to be dropped often.<br /><br />It snaps easily to the phone and exposes all of the important ports and interfaces - the camera, the audio port, the microphone and the speaker. The buttons are covered but the case provides equivalents that allow for easy button pushes that require very little additional effort.<br /><br />So, for such minimal protection, why would I rate this five stars? Simple - this is not designed to be a high-end case, it is meant to be very basic protection and it does that. And, considering the price, it provides this protection on a budget. For a simple rubber sleeve, this case is actually a pretty good deal and most of the time it will keep the phone from damage when the phone is bumped or dropped. If that's all that you expect to happen to your phone, you don't need anything more substantial than this case.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Works Well with My External Hard Drives",
    "text": "I have a couple of USB 3.0 external hard drives that I use for storing pictures and software archives, and both of them use this exact cable type to connect to the computer. I was interested in the NewLobo cable as a spare cable as I am always misplacing the ones I use with the drives and having a backup cable would be very handy. So far this cable has worked out very well for me and has given me no issues at all.<br /><br />First things first - NewLobo offers a 1-year warranty on their cable and that says a lot. It's not a particularly expensive cable and it would cost more to replace the cable under warranty than the cable is actually worth. This says that NewLobo believes in their product and that's a big deal to me. I have used so many products that have a nameless, faceless manufacturer and when it breaks there's no recourse. Even if it is just a simple cable, I find it reassuring that the manufacturer stands behind it.<br /><br />This is the flat-style cable, not round, and there are some advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, it is less likely to tangle. That said, I am usually not a fan of flat cables as I can't help but think that a flat cable is weaker at the ends where it connects to the plugs. This is based on speculation only and has no basis on experience.<br /><br />Operationally, it is a perfect drop-in replacement for the cables that come with my drives. I did not notice a speed difference between this cable and the others I use and I had no trouble mounting/unmounting/accessing my drives through this cable. I am satisfied with it.<br /><br />The fact that these come in a 2-pack is gravy.<br /><br />I am satisfied with this cable and am happy to recommend it. It's a no-nonsense cable that gets the job done, and it is not expensive at all - especially in a 2-pack.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Tempered Glass Privacy Screen - Works Great",
    "text": "Most people think of screen protection for a mobile phone as a glass or plastic cover that prevents the actual screen from shattering. That's true, this is the most important aspect of screen protection. But, what about protecting the data displayed on the screen? I have seen privacy screens for laptop screens, but this is the first I have used with a mobile phone and it works exactly like the laptop screen protectors.<br /><br />Similar to a regular screen protector, this is a thin sheet of glass that applies very smoothly and easily with no bubbles. It has fine screen coverage to the edge of the phone - this has been an issue on some other screen protectors I have used but not this one.<br /><br />With this screen protector in place, the screen is definitely darker than usual and it might be helpful to adjust the screen brightness. It is a lot like looking at your screen through a pair of sunglasses. Turning the phone at a 45-degree angle makes the screen appear completely black as if the screen has been turned off - no light can be seen at all.<br /><br />Before I put this protector on the phone I held it up to a light source and saw a repeating pattern of the light source itself, almost like I had held up a mirror to a mirror to get a replicated image. I think this protector works via polarized light and the repeating image is an effect of that - I have seen similar phenomena when wearing polarizing sunglasses.<br /><br />If protecting the data on your phone screen is as important to you as protecting the screen itself, this is the screen protector you need. It works great, is easy to apply and is sufficient protection for you phone's screen to prevent physical damage. Just make sure you have the right one for your model of phone.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Beautiful Wallet Case",
    "text": "I prefer wallet cases to traditional half-shell cases for the simple reason that they protect the screen a bit better from puncture and crush damage. This particular wallet case is a lot more elegant and exotic than most that I have seen and it has some nice features to it.<br /><br />First off, this is a real leather wallet. I have the cappuccini version which is a creamy brown color. It's not cow leather but instead is (I think) ostrich leather. It is covered in the distinctive pock marks for where feathers were when the bird was alive and as such it gives this case a very distinctive and exotic look. I have seen men's wallets made with this same leather.<br /><br />Inside there are five pockets on the left side (the flap) and the fifth pocket has a clear plastic window for showing a picture ID like a driver's license. Behind the pockets is a place for larger items like cash. If you don't wish to carry more than the phone and you would rather leave your regular wallet or purse at home, this case can store everything you need except your keys. The right side holds just one thing - the phone.<br /><br />It took me a few minutes to figure out how to get the phone in the case before I realized that there is a small flap that is not sewn down on the left side of the phone holder that slides out from where it's tucked in to make room for getting the phone in the holder. One the phone is in, the flap is tucked back in and the phone is very secure. It is very highly unlikely that this case will allow the phone to fall out, though I imagine if you shake the case very hard it can be done.<br /><br />When snapped shut this looks like a miniature version of a woman's purse. The wrist strap adds some functionality and also furthers the image of being a purse.<br /><br />I have looked over this case very carefully and have found no loose stitching or uneven seams. All sewing seems to be very tight and well-done. If not abused this case should last longer than the phone it is designed to protect.<br /><br />In terms of protection, this case does a fine job. It keeps the screen from taking direct hits and it provides sufficient edge and corner protection to absorb drops and falls without too much trouble. This is not a crush-proof case by any means and will not help if shoved in a back pocket and sat upon but it is enough to keep the phone safe from most dangers.<br /><br />This is a very nice and elegant case, well made and providing good protection for an iPhone 6. It does add some bulk, of course, but it makes up for it in style. Overall, this is a very nice case and is worth consideration if you want a wallet case.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "text": "We live about 5-10 minutes from a water park and what to do with my phone while there has been a concern I have entertained for a while. I do not want to just leave it in the car and lockers are expensive. My particular phone is not waterproof so I have limited options. This particular waterproof pouch/case is just the solution I needed.<br /><br />The pouch portion of this case is a polyurethane bag of sufficient thickness to protect against most bumps and scratches. It has a clear front so that the face of the phone can be seen and it allows some interaction with the phone. The clamp on the top is a two-piece assembly with plastic hooks that snap the two halves together and close the bag, forming a seal. I was skeptical of this design until I actually put some air in the bag and closed it with the clamp. It's not just water-tight, it's actually air-tight. If you put your phone in this bag and seal it properly you can submerge your phone underwater without any concern. That said, I would probably not go diving with it as it is not clear as to how deep it is certified to protect when submerged.<br /><br />Included with the pouch is a lanyard so that it can be warn around the neck if desired as well as an armband. On the back of the pouch is a loop for the armband but it will just as easily work as a belt loop.<br /><br />I can't really find any problems with this case and I think it's a great solution for anyone wanting to keep a phone - or any other small device or item - dry without worrying about leaks or water damage. This little case is going with me whenever I go to the lake or into the woods - and it's definitely going to the water park.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "A Lot of Phone for a Little Price",
    "text": "[[VIDEOID:1874099f0059609f7c4c05ea34c2343e]] Finding a good smartphone is easy. Finding the right smartphone is a lot more difficult due to the large number of choices available. Of all the choices available, Android is probably the strongest choice (though some would argue that an iPhone is better). The IRULU V1S is a *large* Android phone and has a number of excellent features that make it worth your consideration, especially when considering the low price point. There is one catch with this phone that is important to note, though - it is 3G, not 4G.<br /><br />As mentioned above, this is a very large phone boasting a 5\" screen. That said, it is very thin and streamlined, just a quarter inch thick which makes it easy to drop in any pocket or tuck into a purse or briefcase. It is very reminiscent of the Motorola RAZR line of phones - very thin and compact.<br /><br />A big screen is not useful if it is unresponsive or if it isn't bright and sharp. Fortunately, this phone's screen is very responsive and very bright and crisp. On most phone screens I have seen at least occasional problems with touching the screen and getting either no response, a delayed response or bad calibration and so far this phone has shown none of these problems. More impressive is the fact that the screen resolution and quality make for exceptional sharpness and the screen is brighter than average. In fact by default it is so bright that it hurt my eyes in a dark room and it wasn't even turned all the way up. I ended up changing the setting to auto-adjust the brightness for me and it is much, much better.<br /><br />Sound quality is also excellent. On the back of the phone, close to the bottom there is a row of pinholes to expose the speaker. The placement is fine but you have to be aware of it when using the phone for playing music as it is easy to cover the speaker holes with the hand inadvertently. So far I have found no issues with the quality of sound - everything is clear and mostly balanced.<br /><br />By far the very best feature of this phone is the camera. The back camera is a whopping 13MP which is the best I have seen in a phone. There are more capable smartphone cameras out there but the price differential between them and this phone is very large. The autofocus is very fast and seems to be very accurate and the phone offers many of the controls that I have on my SLR and point-and-shoot cameras (such as panorama, facial beauty, white balance and a lot more). The front camera is a more modest 5MB, but I remember my first digital camera being less than 3MP so I have a very difficult time finding fault with the lower megapixel rating. Both cameras do a good job of trying to adjust for low light though you can see some flickering when the light is sufficiently low. Picture quality is great and I love the ease of switching back and forth between the live camera and the filmstrip view. Even if you don't want to use this phone as a phone, the camera is worth the asking price on it's own merits.<br /><br />There are a couple of things about this phone that came as pleasant surprises. Included in the box is a screen protector shield which is a very unusual addition with a phone - normally these are purchased separately or they come with a phone case, so the inclusion is a very welcome addition. A bigger surprise in the box, though, is a pair of earbuds with a built-in micropohone. These earbuds are nothing special in terms of sound quality but they're certainly not unacceptable by any means. If you don't have a set of earbuds already, it is no longer a problem. Also in the box is a USB charging and sync cable - standard fare anymore.<br /><br />Another plus is the fact that this phone has a fingerprint scanner for access control. I have seen phones with this capability but this is the first one I have used and it seems to work fairly well. My fingers are a little wider than the scanner face so I have to be particular when I line up to swipe. Someone with smaller fingers will have an easier time.<br /><br />There is one thing not in the box that was a small surprise and that's an AC-to-USB adapter. I am not sure why one is not included but its absence is not a deal-breaker. I have a bunch of these so it's no big deal, but if you don't have one you will have to charge the phone by connecting to a computer instead.<br /><br />With that thought in mind I plugged this phone into my computer's USB port to see what my computer would do with it. Windows correctly recognized the phone as an Android phone and loaded up the MT65xx driver. I was able to locate it in the control panel but by default was unable to interact with it. I was able to enable shared storage though and could copy files between the computer and phone.<br /><br />One of the things Android phones are good at is running applications. This one works well and runs them *fast*. It has a quad-core processor and it smokes through games and other applications. There should be no problems with this phone and sluggishness with applications.<br /><br />I did discover that when I turned on the WiFi and looked for networks the phone could see and connect to my 2.4GHz network but not the 5GHz network. I inquired about this and was informed that the phone's WiFi adapter cannot operate at 5GHz. This is ok, but it is an important consideration when buying a phone with the intention of connecting to wireless networks. I also discovered something else - this phone is not capable of 4G connectivity but is limited to 3G and below. I would be more critical of this except that the phone is really inexpensive for everything else it provides.<br /><br />Call quality - so far I have had no issues. I can hear the person on the other end enough issue and so far no one has complained about the sound quality on my end. Phones tend to degrade over time and I am interested in seeing how well this one holds up. My record for a phone was a first-generation Droid which lasted 4 years, so I am anxious to see if this phone can match that.<br /><br />IRULU makes a good phone, loaded with features and priced very competitively. This phone is worth a look if you want a feature-packed phone and are on a more limited budget.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Better Built than the Average Monopod",
    "text": "There are two different kinds of “selfie sticks” (also called monopods). Most are Bluetooth devices that connect to the phone and operate the phone shutter via remote in the handle. These monopods require occasional recharging though the battery life is lengthy. The other kind plugs into the audio jack of the phone and the button operates the shutter via wire. There is no battery and all power comes via the audio jack. This particular monopod is of the latter type and it works well, though I do have an Android phone that will not work properly with it (not unexpected, see below).<br /><br />This monopod is similar in design to most others; it is a telescoping rod with a base for attaching the harness on the end and it has a rubberized handle with a covered button. Where it differs, though, is in the quality of the rod which is a bit better than average and it is definitely sturdy enough to support the phone without bending. This actually needs to be emphasized as I have seen some monopods with very weak rods that flex a little too easily.<br /><br />The audio jack cable extends from under the base at the end of the rod and has some flex to it that allows it to attach to almost any size phone without too much trouble. Because the cable is coiled it will retract into the rod if the base is pulled off so exercise a little caution when extending. That said, the base is well attached so there should be no issue if the monopod is not abused.<br /><br />I tried this monopod with three devices. The first was a Windows Phone which is not listed amongst the supported devices, the second was a Kyocera phone running the right version of Android and the third was a Sony Xperia Z running Android. The Windows phone was a flop as expected, and when the button on the monopod was pressed it turned up the volume on the phone. With the Kyocera phone, pressing the button caused the image to zoom in. This is a problematic phone and has not worked with any monopod I have tried, Bluetooth or otherwise. With the Sony, the action worked as expected and pressing the button caused the shutter to snap. This is exactly the same behavior I have observed with these three devices and other monopods of this type. So, it is safe to say it works with a majority of Android phones and it does not work at all with the Windows phone. It was worth a try.<br /><br />This is a nice monopod, better than others of its type that I have used. It is more solidly build than average and has a good, firm telescoping rod and it is assembled well. If you want a monopod and you want/need to avoid Bluetooth, this is a fine choice.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "The Right Case for My Phone",
    "text": "I carry a Nokia Lumia 822 phone and it has been a great phone. The problem is that it is not the most popular model of phone available and as a result it is difficult to find accessories for it. I used to have an Otter Box for it but that case completely fell apart. I tried the Incipio case and while it worked well enough it did not really cover the phone and had a tendency to slip off the right edge of the phone. I finally found the Trident Aegis case and decided to give it a try. I figured it is not an expensive case and in the worst case I am out a few dollars and have to keep looking. Fortunately, my search for a phone case has ended.<br /><br />This is a half-shell type of case that is a fusion of hard rubber for the edges and a hard plastic back that protects the back of the phone. The hard rubber provides enough cushion to protect against a good amount of drop shock but is pliable enough to allow getting the phone in and out of the case without a huge amount of effort. The case provides flaps to cover the audio and USB ports too, not enough to call it waterproof but enough to keep the majority of dust and dirt away.<br /><br />I like the fact that this case provides hard buttons similar to what the Otter Box provides. With some other cases I have tried I have had difficulty pushing the buttons on the sides because the case either got in the way or would not line up properly. This is not a problem for this case.<br /><br />I really appreciate the fact that this case includes a screen protector. Some cases to not come with a screen protector but this one comes with one that is easy to apply to the face of the phone. This particular screen protector is not going to be of much help for hard impact damage but it will prevent scratching and cutting of the screen in most cases. That's good news for me as I have a bad habit of dropping my phone in the same pocket with my keys.<br /><br />I went with the blue version of the case which I expected to be a nice, electric blue. It is more of a turquoise color which is fine, just not quite what I expected.<br /><br />I have seen some other reviewers comment that this case doesn't fit right? In my case it fits my phone almost perfectly.<br /><br />If you have a Nokia Lumia 822 phone, this is probably the best case available for it, better than even the Otter Box. It fits well, seems to be made nicely, it is attractive and it includes a screen protector. For the price, this is a great case. I wish I had started with this case - I never would have bought the Otter Box or the Incipio had I known about the Trident case.",

    "title": "Good Half-Shell Case with Bumper Guard",
    "text": "A good cell phone case is a wise investment for any smartphone user. Even a cheap rubber sleeve case that costs very little provides some protection for that expensive phone, though better cases provide more and protect in different ways. The Iron Shield case by Verus is a very nice and attractive case that does a nice job of preventing drop damage, particularly around the edges.<br /><br />This case is different than most phone cases I have used in that it has a removable aluminum ring that runs around the edge of the case. The ring helps with corner and edge shocks and it also helps with keeping the case in place when protecting the phone. When snapping the phone into the case the ring is removed to allow the case more flexibility when inserting the phone and then the ring is reattached afterward.<br /><br />I have not really tried to test how well this case protects the phone but I did notice a couple of things. First, the ring adds some rigidity to the case so that when it's in place the case is a lot less likely to twist, even when the phone is not in the case at the time. I also noticed that for corner and edge drops the ring takes the brunt of the impact. For a flat fall the case will protect the phone as long as it lands on the back; if the phone is dropped on the face, particularly on a surface like a gravel driveway or other hard textured surface, the case can't really offer a lot.<br /><br />The one thing I wish this case included is a screen protector. Some cases come with a plastic scratch-resistant sheet that applies to the face of the phone and while it is of little use for impact damage it is good for scratch prevention. Most cases anymore don't seem to include such which is unfortunate.<br /><br />The case fits the phone very nicely and properly exposes the audio and USB ports as well as the camera.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice case that provides good protection for an LG G3 phone. The metal bumper guard adds impact protection to the sides and corner of the phone where it is needed most. It looks nice, too, which is an added bonus.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Improves 3G Coverage Adequately Over a Small Area",
    "text": "The cell signal in our house is good everywhere except in the basement, which is partially finished. I have put together a home office down there so I spend a good deal of time in the basement and when I receive a call it gets a little spotty due to the reduced reception. When I do get a data connection it is often 1X and unreliable. Connecting to the WiFi network resolves the data issue but it does not help the call quality nor does it reduce dropped calls. I looked to this booster kit to help improve the connectivity and reception in the basement and it does work; however, it requires some planning when setting up and it may not be the right fit for your configuration depending on the coverage you need.<br /><br />First, it is important to understand that this is a 3G booster and has limited use with current 4G/LTE phones. If you have a 4G phone, you are better off with the 4G version so you can get the benefit of the 4G speed boost, not just call quality improvements.<br /><br />The unit consists of an indoor box that handles processing, an indoor antenna and an outdoor antenna. This requires some planning and coordination. The two antennas require some distance apart to work properly or they interfere with one another a little, so planning ahead is going to help the install go smoother. The higher up you can place the outdoor antenna the better. Because I wanted the unit in the basement and I wanted the best possible signal, this meant mounting the outdoor antenna at a much higher point on the house. The indoor antenna is a directional one and it requires a little planning as well – don't point at the outdoor antenna and decide where you want to place this antenna to maximize the coverage in the room.<br /><br />Double-paned windows are not your friend when it comes to this unit. The glass interferes with the signal and prevents the unit from really working properly.<br /><br />Once everything was all connected and the unit configured properly, I went to the furthest area of the basement where the signal is typically weakest and almost always fails over to 1X. I turned off the WiFi and let the phone figure out what to do. After a short time, it picked up the 3G signal and was usable. It wasn't a particularly strong signal but it was enough to make stable phone calls with good quality and no drops so far. This particular unit is designed for small area coverage like a room or two, so if you need full house coverage consider one of the other units that offers a stronger signal and better range.<br /><br />For boosting 3G coverage over a small area (a room or two), this unit seems to work fairly well. Installation requires some pre-planning, and the signal strength is not super-strong, but it's good for correcting holes in coverage in a home.",

    "title": "Stylish iPhone 5S Wallet Case",
    "text": "I have not used wallet cases in the past, having stuck with Otter Boxes and other similar cases that provide good protection on all sides of the phone but little on the glass face. Most cases come with a plastic shield that protects the glass from scratches but few offer any kind of impact protection. This wallet case is the first case I have used that actually does protect the face of the phone, and so far I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />Out of the box, this is a nice-looking and sturdy phone holder. It opens like a small book with the hard plastic holder on the right and a place for a couple of credit cards or a driver's license on the left. The phone snaps into place without any difficulty and the case holds it securely but not so tightly that it cannot be easily removed. The plastic portion has the holes in the right spot so that the phone can be used as a camera or a music device without having to remove it from the case. Overall, it is a well thought-put design.<br /><br />When closed, the case protects the face of the phone from most simple impacts. If dropped and the phone hits something just right it can shatter the glass, but with this case protecting the phone the leather absorbs many of those impacts and keeps the glass from taking the brunt of an impact.<br /><br />Aside from protecting the phone, this is a very stylish and attractive phone case that somewhat resembles a new brown leather wallet. It is far and away the most attractive case I have ever had for a phone. As a bonus it does not add appreciable bulk to the phone.<br /><br />As mentioned, the case has a place for credit cards facing the phone and this just strikes me funny. I have demagnetized hotel room keys with my phone by getting it too close to them and I have been very gun shy about putting my phone close to anything magnetic since. However, the pocket for cards is just right for a driver's license, business cards or even a small amount of cash. There is a small magnet in the case on the flap side too that works to gently hold the case closed. So far I have not encountered any issues with this magnet interfering with the phone but again I would be hesitant to put in a card with a magnetic stripe. Perhaps I am just a little paranoid.<br /><br />This is a really nice phone case, more attractive than most and it protects the phone a little more completely than other cases I have used due to the leather flap that closes over the face of the phone. I hesitate to put anything with a magnetic stripe in the pocket but the pocket has other uses that make it very useful anyway. Overall, I think this case is excellent and am happy to recommend it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

    "title": "Cell Phone Bike Mount/Tablet Mount - a Combined Review",
    "text": "This review is a little different than most I have written in that it covered two products at once. Amazon will not allow two reviews against the same listing, and sometimes multiple products are grouped under the same listing. In order to review both, both products have to be combined in the same review. I received both the bike mount and the tablet mount for testing and review, so I have combined them into this one review. This is possible because they are both excellent products and I would give them the same rating separately. I will review the bike mount first, followed by the tablet mount.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Cell Phone Bike Mount:<br /><br />A bike mount is a specialty item useful to those who spend a lot of time on a bike, for commuting, touring or running trails. It is important to get a good one if you're going to invest in a mount for your bike, in particular if you are planning to hit the trails off-road. I have come to associate AVANTEK with inexpensive but high-quality electronics and accessories so my expectations were very high for this bike mount. It has not let me down. I did find one minor concern with it that is worth mentioning.<br /><br />I will start with the price - $15.99 as I write this (please be aware that the price can change at some point). There are less expensive bike mounts available but you likely will not find one as good at even a higher price. For the money this is about as well-made and thoughtfully designed mount available.<br /><br />My main cell phone is a Nokia Lumia and I was able to get it to fit in the bracket absolutely perfectly. The bracket is a slider type that adjusts to accommodate just about any cell phone available. There is a latch on the back so that when the bracket is adjusted just right it can be locked into place. It also has a supplementary band to add additional security to keep the phone from coming loose. When I put my phone in the bracket, it did fit but not perfectly until I removed it from it's normal protective case. This may prove to be a problem for some but at the same time consider that the mount is a form of protection in its own right and you're not going to drop the phone when it's in this bracket.<br /><br />With my phone in the harness I picked up the phone mount and shook it very vigorously in an effort to shake my phone free. It did not let my phone escape in this very unrealistic test but it did tell me I can count on this harness to hold my phone securely no matter what kind of terrain I encounter.<br /><br />The clamp that attaches to the handlebar is probably the most impressive part of this whole mount. It works in principle like a pair of vice grip pliers and once tightened has a latch on it that holds it just a little tighter in place and it prevents the clamp from loosening up. The harness clips on to this clamp and snaps into place so it will not shake loose. The base where the harness attaches actually swivels so the phone can be mounted almost anywhere on the bike (within reason).<br /><br />This is an impressive bike mount and you likely will not find one that's better for even close to the same amount of money. It is very well made, it holds the phone very securely and is very affordable. If you want a phone mount for your phone to go on your bike, give this mount a look.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Tablet Mount:<br /><br />Many people use GPS devices and mobile phones as navigation devices in vehicles. There is no reason that an adequately connected tablet cannot serve the same purpose except that tablets are usually larger and more difficult to secure. Avantek's tablet windshield mount answers this need, though caution is advised when using it due to the size of device for which it is designed. That said, I have found an interesting non-vehicular use for this mount that makes it more useful to me.<br /><br />The mounting harness itself accommodates larger tablets, up to 10&#34;, by employing spring-loaded arms that slide out to allow a larger tablet to fit. Each arm is capped with a molded rubber corner that holds the tablet in place without slipping. The harness also has hard rubber padding that further keeps the tablet in place and reduces play in the grip. When using this mounting solution it is very unlikely that a tablet will come loose.<br /><br />The mount has two jointed connections, one a straight hinge and one a limited-range ball joint, that allows positioning the tablet just right. The ball joint moves smoothly and has infinite angles of positioning. The hinge joint is graduated and with each point (approximately 30) in the joint the position clicks audibly. This type of hinged joint is less prone to slipping, even when not completely tightened.<br /><br />The suction cup on this mounting bracket is one of the largest I have seen. When attached to a glass surface it holds tightly with excellent suction. I suspect that, like all other suction cups I have ever used, it will &#34;let go&#34; when mounted on a cold glass surface, though I am optimistic that it will hold longer than smaller cups.<br /><br />I have one reservation about mounting this to the windshield for a tablet. A large tablet mounted like this will, if not placed properly, interfere with visibility. That said, I was able to position my tablet in such a way as to not appreciably impact my view of the road. I would recommend not using this mount with a 10&#34; tablet in a vehicle with a more narrow field of view out the windshield.<br /><br />I found an alternate use for this bracket that has worked out well for me. Instead of using it in the car, I use the bracket in my home office by mounting it to the window next to my desk. This makes my tablet a lot more accessible without taking up any desk space, it still allows me to grab the tablet and move with it and it allows me to operate the tablet as an appliance while still having my computer up and running at the same time.<br /><br />This is a nice bracket for mounting a tablet that works well. It holds the tablet securely, it adjusts for just about any angle and it holds larger tablets in place. Caution should be used when mounting with a larger tablet to the windshield but when mounted to avoid interfering with visibility it opens up the ability to use the tablet as a GPS (data plan permitting).<br /><br />---<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided samples of these products in exchange for fair, honest and thorough reviews. Even though I received these products at no cost I have rated and reviewed them without bias, based solely on my experiences with them.",

    "title": "Very Convenient USB Charger; Consider Size when Placing",
    "text": "With multiple electronic devices that require a USB port for charging, it's easy to run out of places to plug in. One solution is to use a powered USB hub but I have not found one that is able to keep up when plugging in multiple devices for charging - more devices means more power required. Myoho's 4-port charger is a good solution to this problem, but it has one possible negative point that's worth consideration, though it is not a showstopper.<br /><br />This charger provides a total of 4 ports, two of which provide 2.4 amps (\"PowerCharger\" ports) and 2 that provide 1.2 amps (\"Universal\" ports). I plugged my tablet and my GPS in the PowerCharger ports and my phone in one of the Universal ports and the charger kept up without breaking a sweat. This one charger easily replaces four on my desk - this is a great benefit, as I have limited plugs on my power brick and frequently have to play games with my plugs to charge things up.<br /><br />I found only one issue that merits mention and that issue depends on where this charger is plugged in. This is a fairly large adapter and because of the placement of the 110V outlet prongs the charger can block the other socket when plugged into a 2-socket wall outlet, regardless of which socket is used in the pair. This is particularly a problem when the other device being plugged in has a ground prong and the insulation molded around the prongs is thick. A plug that has no ground prong, like a lamp, is unlikely to cause any issue. Whether this is a worthwhile tradeoff is something that should be considered. If there are two chargers already taking up the outlets, this is a wonderful trade. In my specific case this is actually irrelevant as I have it on a power brick where the sockets are offset enough to compensate.<br /><br />Myoho has put together a great USB 4-port charger. It does a fine job of charging USB devices quickly and in parallel.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Great For Charging My Tablet, Excellent Data Rate",
    "text": "Most USB cables are no-name cables that serve a basic purpose. The manufacturer does not put any indicator of who manufactured it on the cable (though the packaging sometimes does) so when a cable fails, it is simply replaced. This cable is different in that Myoho saw fit to put their name right on the cable and warranty the cable for a year. That's a good indicator that they stand behind their product. My experience with this cable has been brief but so far I am quite pleased.<br /><br />This is a very unassuming cable, simple black casing and molding on the plugs and the Myoto name and USB logo printed on either end the of the cable. However, this is the heaviest gauge microUSB cable I have ever used. I have had at least one of these types of cables come apart and degrade (came with a Nokia phone), but I doubt this will be an issue with this cable.<br /><br />I decided to use this cable with my tablet, a Sony Xperia Z tablet that is particular about the cable used to charge it and sync with my laptop. The fact that it works with my tablet is a huge plus right out of the box. I noticed two things about this cable when compared to the cable that came with my tablet: it allows my tablet to charge faster than the provided cable, even when powered on, and it facilitates excellent connectivity between my computer and tablet, again achieving a better data rate than the provided cable. This cable is now permanently assigned to my tablet.<br /><br />The full retail on this cable is $15 as I write this and that's a little higher than the average cable (it is selling for lower here on Amazon as I write this, though). That said, I see few manufacturers back their cables with a warranty nor take enough pride in their work to put the company name right on the product. All indicators so far are that I am very unlikely to need the warranty coverage and considering that it allows for faster charging and faster connectivity between my laptop and my tablet that's worth the slightly higher price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

    "title": "Decent Stylus",
    "text": "We have a couple of computers with touch screens as well as a tablet so a stylus for touch screens is very much something we can use. Having worked with a Wacom Intuos5 for a while I thought I knew what to expect. I was right in some ways and wrong in others. Overall, this is a nice stylus.<br /><br />This is a small and lightweight stylus. Having hands like a gorilla I expected this to be a little too small for my hands but it's actually quite comfortable. It's a little shorter than a typical ink pen but it's about the same width as a standard wooden pencil, so it will be comfortable for most hands. This is a plus right off the bat.<br /><br />I expected this stylus to have a soft rubber tip, and I was partially right. The tip is covered is a fine mesh weave which should make it glide a little more freely across a glass surface. Some thought went into the tip.<br /><br />On our tablet (a Sony Xperia Z) we had no issues with this stylus at all except in the learning curve involved in touching the screen with something other than a finger. We had no trouble in using it to navigate the web, open and manipulate applications and more. So far, so good.<br /><br />I decided to try the stylus on my laptop with a drawing application and I encountered the only real issue I have with it. As I dragged it across the surface, unless I bore down on it, it would skip often. I am still trying to figure out why this is the case - the tip should almost eliminate all of the skipping. Turning the stylus such that the tip's weave is parallel to the direction of movement helps with this but does not completely eliminate the behavior.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good stylus that works well as a pointing device, especially for those with large fingers that could use a little help with pinpointing things in the screen. I am a little less enthusiastic about it as an art tool but it is workable in that regard.",

    "title": "Works Better for Holding Post-It Notes than Cell Phone",
    "text": "We have a million pens and pencils all over the house and we have them in assorted cups, bins and drawers, so a pencil cup is a very useful item in my house. This particular pencil holder is designed to also be a cell phone holder. It does a poor job of this but is much better suited for sticky notes which makes more sense anyway.<br /><br />I like the weighting of this cup. It has a heavy base which makes it more stable when it is loaded up, which in turn makes it a lot less likely to tip over and spill its contents everywhere.<br /><br />I also like the size of this cup. There is enough room for a set of magic markers or dry erase markers, with a little room left over. In addition, there is a small space for the likes of paper clips or push pins which is a very nice thing – most pencil cups do not have such and if you put small items like paper clips in you have to dump the cup to get to them.<br /><br />The issue with this cup is actually the fact that it's touted as a cell phone holder. Please, do not waste your time with this if you want it for holding your phone. While it will hold a cell phone and there is a place for the cord while the phone is on the cup, anything other than the smallest phone will block access to the pens and pencils unless you turn the cup. It seems silly. Instead, the place intended for a phone is much better suited for a square of sticky notes which fit nearly perfectly. Having a supply of sticky notes along with the pens and pencils makes good sense.<br /><br />This is not a bad pencil cup and it is very useful. There are some thoughtful features that have been implemented on this cup. However, it is ill-suited for holding a cell phone as advertised – instead consider using it for small note pads or sticky notes which usually are no far from a pen cup anyway.",

    "title": "Good Phone With a Few Negative Behaviors",
    "text": "I have been a Verizon customer for several years and I had a first generation Droid for many of those years. I have used phones from Samsung, Motorola, LG and Nokia but up until this point I have never used a Kyocera phone. I was interested in trying the Hydro Elite, and so far my experience has been middle-of-the-road - there are some areas for improvement.<br /><br />First things first - I received the phone through the Vine program and it did NOT come with the SIM card. This is probably because it was not a purchased phone but is an evaluation handset. The phone does not come with service right out of the box, it has to be activated and a SIM card is needed for that. People buying a service plan should get a card. People (like me) who are already on Verizon and already have a smart phone will have a card in their old phones which can be used in this new phone. The SIM card itself does not make the card work, it needs the data written on it. Verizon customers (new and existing) will get what they need to activate this phone, so if you buy this phone and subscribe to a plan you'll have a card in it when it arrives.<br /><br />I took the SIM card out of my current phone, popped it into the Hydro Elite and powered it on. It immediately connected to the network, acquired my phone number and activated itself. Within just a couple of minutes, it was ready to go.<br /><br />The Hydro Elite is a petite Android phone, smaller than most other smart phones I have seen. Very curvy and smooth, it is similar in looks to an iPhone, but it's actually an Android-based offering. It's a tight and solid little device, built to handle a little moisture and some jostling.<br /><br />I particularly like the brightness and clarity of the screen. In spite of being slightly smaller than other smart phones I have used, the screen is very clear and crisp.<br /><br />One of the main complaints I have seen regarding this phone is about call quality. I think the call clarity is acceptable although I have used clearer and better-sounding hand sets in the past. It has the very slight sound of talking in a tunnel or in a can, though I have to look for this in order to really mind it much. The volume is fine too and can be adjusted. That all said, the sound quality when the speaker phone is used is mediocre at best.<br /><br />My first issue occurred when I tried to connect to my wireless network. It located it, allowed me to put in my security key, and then constantly insisted the network was out of range - even when I was three feet from the router. I deleted the connection, put it in again and the problem is gone. I suspect I entered the key in incorrectly, but I never received a message as such.<br /><br />The next issue I ran into involves the Verizon stuff installed on it. Once I connected to the wireless network I get a very persistent message that appears about Verizon's location service sending a large number of SMS messages. I have not yet figured out the silver bullet to make this stop and it interferes with everything I try to do on this phone. I am sure there is some way to make this quit happening but I have not found it yet. I don't care if the application sends SMS data or not - I just don't want to hear about it every 10-15 seconds (yes, it's that persistent). This is not Kyocera's fault - this is Verizon's issue, and for me this is absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />I use my phone in my car every day and my car is set up to allow Bluetooth phones to connect to it for voice commands and hands-free operation. Connecting the Hydro Elite was very simple and I had no difficulty connecting the two. However, one thing that did not happen was that the phone book never downloaded and I could not call anyone by voice command. This is an inconvenience and is probably not entirely Kyocera's fault, but I have not figured out how to get the car's system to see the phone book which was automatic with other phones I have used. I can still use the dashboard buttons to dial, but that's not ideal.<br /><br />This is not that bad of a phone. It's actually a nice little phone and it works pretty well. I love the screen and it's an attractive little device. However, it has some issues with implementation that make it a little harder to recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/30/13: Following the suggestion of a fellow reviewer, I allowed the phone to connect to the Play store and updated the VZ Security application and this solved the issue with the persistent message about SMS data. It is unfortunate that Verizon's application made it out the door in this state but I am glad it has been fixed. From the message that would appear, it was not at all clear that the security application was behind the issue. I am leaving the rating at 3 stars for now.",

    "title": "Elegant Device With A Few Quirks",
    "text": "I moved to a Lumia 822 Windows Phone after having had a first generation Droid for several years. I was happy with my Droid and it worked well, but after it finally started to degrade it was time to move to a new phone. I decided to try the Windows phone platform for no reason other than wanting something different, and of the options available to me I was most impressed with the Lumia 822. I wish I had made this switch a while ago...<br /><br />The Lumia is a larger phone than my original Droid, and I was a little apprehensive when I bought it because of this. My concern was that it would be bulky and would be cumbersome to use, but this has not been the case. It fits almost perfectly in a pants pocket and it is just the right size when in operation for comfortable talk. It is large enough to allow for talking into the actual receiver instead of relying on the way someone holds the phone which means consistent sound clarity for the person on the other end.<br /><br />Call quality has been great. So far I have had no issues with the ability to speak and be heard in a call. In fact, when switching between speaker phone and regular calling mode the person on the other end has said that they cannot always tell the difference. This was an unexpected bonus - most phones I have used do not work as well as speaker phones.<br /><br />It is important to understand that this phone does not have a standard physical QWERTY keyboard but instead has a virtual keyboard that it displays on the screen. This is becoming the norm anymore, though I personally prefer having a phone that has a physical fly-out keyboard. In use, the keyboard works fairly well though I have occasional issues with tapping the right keys as I have larger fingers which means that sometimes the phone registers the wrong button pressed. This is more the exception than the rule but it happens often enough to merit attention - if you have larger hands, be aware that typing can get a little frustrating if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />The greatest difficulty I have had with this phone is when using it with the car. I have a Ford Focus with full Sync system, and my Droid worked flawlessly with it. The Lumia works almost as well, though I have had the same problem many have had - when making an outbound call the system can shift into privacy mode and no one on either end hears anything. I have found that by using the phone to dial instead of using voice or the dashboard keypad the problem can be completely avoided but this is inconvenient. Recently my phone downloaded a large update and since then it seems to be working more consistently - time will tell if this has truly fixed the issue, but for now I have an acceptable workaround.<br /><br />Now, about Windows 8 on the phone... I am not a huge fan of Windows on the normal (non-touchscreen) computer, but on a touchscreen phone it seems like this is the way a phone should work. The Windows phone OS is very intuitive, easy to use and it just works. I love the tile-based screens. With my Droid I occasionally had issues where I somehow scrolled to a different screen and got icons messed up because of it; I have not had any issues of that kind with the Windows OS and so far am absolutely pleased. The one drawback I have with the platform is that once in a great while the phone will simply reboot without warning - never during a call (so far) but always unexpected. To be fair, I had the same problem with Android at about the same frequency, but it still needs to be mentioned.<br /><br />As at least one other reviewer mentioned, the number of apps in the online store is small compared to the quantity of apps in the Android or iPhone store. So far I have had no problem finding applications to suit my needs. There are more applications being added all the time but the problem is that the market share does not favor the Windows phone. The biggest targets are Android and iOS and that is where the majority of the applications are found right now.<br /><br />There is one application that I have been unable to find that I think is sorely needed - a reputable security suite. As I write this I have found none at all. I have looked at Norton and Kaspersky in particular for applications of this type and they do not support Windows 8 on the phone. To me, this is a big deal. There are partial solutions in the store but so far I have not found an antivirus or anything else that would be termed good mobile security. I do sincerely hope this is corrected soon. This is not a shortcoming of the phone itself; rather, it is a reflection of the Windows 8 mobile market share.<br /><br />The Lumia 822 is not without its quirks and issues but overall it is a very nice phone. It has a good feature set, it is easy to use and it's the right size for me. When it eventually dies, I will likely get something similar.",

    "text": "I have been using Kaspersky Mobile Security on my Droid phone for the better part of the year. I decided on Kaspersky because I use Pure 2.0 on my home network computers and am very pleased with it. So far, Kaspersky's Mobile Security (just Mobile Security from here forward) has given me only minor issues.<br /><br />Installation was a minor event and did not take too terribly long from start to finish. After loading to my phone and installing itself, Mobile Security presented me the requisite welcome and options screens for setting up everything. I was able to set up my password first then manage all of my settings after which the package was ready to go to work for me.<br /><br />After I finished all of my configurations the application has quietly sat in the background. It is rare that it lets me know that anything is happening, though when it feels the need to request input it does so with a full-screen dialog box.<br /><br />Probably a function of my phone's hardware, scans of the system tend to be slow. This really does not bother me, but it's something to consider. More interesting through is that Mobile Security is always doing something in the background, evidenced by the occasional messages about applications passing scans.<br /><br />I have SMS and number blocking set up on my phone and this is one of the areas where I have found that Mobile Security is not right. When I receive an SMS message, it comes through, *after* which I get a dialog from Mobile Security asking if I want to block the number. This seems a little bit backward. I would rather be given the option to reject a message from an unknown number before I see the message at all. Also, the dialog can be dismissed without touching the screen, simply by touching the back button. This is true for calls and messages. Now, once a number is blacklisted or whitelisted, there's never another dialog about that particular number ever again.<br /><br />The most irritating thing that Mobile Security has done was to advertise an update but then would fail to download said update. I got messages repeatedly for weeks about an update and I was not able to successfully update Mobile Security until it finally worked. The update, when it finally downloaded successfully, installed itself quickly and so far has had no observable impact on my phone.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained of international text message charges, but so far I have not had any of this happening to me. The charges have been unchanging and very consistent. I am not sure if the problem others have seen is a function of having something turned on/off or being on a particular network.<br /><br />Resource usage seems to be low with Mobile Security. I monitor available memory closely and I watch battery strength and have not observed any outrageous resource usage since installing Mobile Security. This may vary by architecture but I have no other units against which to test.<br /><br />Important to me is the ability to use my phone as a tethering device on occasion. I was worried that Mobile Security might interfere. Fortunately, it has not.<br /><br />I have no idea what will happen if Mobile Security finds an issue. It has found nothing amiss since I have loaded it.<br />So far, Kaspersky Mobile Security has worked to my satisfaction. It does have a couple of minor quirks with it that can be irritating but so far I haven't seen any real issues. In my experience it's competent security.",

In short, the seller did a great job, the device came as expected, was in condition stated; this phone is absolute crap and I wouldn't recommend anyone buy it as a doorstop, let alone a phone.

The flip down  holder is notched & has a concave groove lined with non-slip rubber to hold your device.<br />5.

The stand has large slide in clips which holds the bag securely open while you fill it. The 2 arms articulate so it auto adjusts as you fill the bag. The stand folds flat for easy storage<br />2. Gusseted bottom allows the bag to ‘stand' open when attached to the stand while filling and after it is filled<br />3. The Max Fill line is clearly embossed on each bag. Since it is not printed, it will not wear off over time<br />4. The sliding sealing mechanism is truly leak proof. The slide extends beyond the opening on one end and is sealed on the other end. I think the only way these would leak is if you overfilled and put it in the freezer.<br />5. The silicone is very pliable but it is also thick. I cannot tear these. Very durable. I expect these to last a long time. Also, I can squeese out the extra air before sealing, which I cant do with glass containers.<br />6. They store flat, so I can stack them which takes up very little space. I purchased 2 sets which replaces 8 bulky glass storage containers. WooHoo - that free'd up a significant amount of cabinet space.<br />7. I hand wash these. They are pretty easy to clean. I do towel dry to ensure they dont get any mold or foul odors. I dont use a dishwasher, so I cant comment on that.<br />8. I love that you can drop these in a pot of boiling water to reheat left overs.<br />9. This company put extra effort into their packaging. Comes in a nice flip top box.<br /><br />CONS:<br />None - At first I thought these were a bit pricey but now that I am using them, they are worth every penny.

It even has tiny bits to fit screws on eyeglasses and any kind of electronics you can think of. The driver itself it magnetic, high quality metal and everything not only feels like something Apple designed and produced, its LOOKS great too. Could not be happier. The hinged magnetic lid works great too. Only things they could improve would be including the nice soft case that is on the Pro Tech kit and if the lid/screw tray/sorter had a magnetic layer to keeps screws from sliding around but those are tiny things that don't matter that much.

I'm also concerned that the one that is currently working, might stop working if the quality is questionable. I don't want to be caught unaware while vacationing and have to scramble to buy another power bank. The size is nice and compact, fits easily in a waist pack. It's disappointing that only one works.<br /><br />UPDATE- After waiting a few days I tried again to power up the 2nd power bank. Strangely enough it began to work, though it took 6-7 hours for it to charge completely. I brought both power banks with me on our vacation, and they worked great to power up our phones.

(I just got this one on December 24)<br /><br />Well, wouldn't you know, one of my kids decided to mess with the phone when I wasn't in the room, and apparently, the phone was dropped. They didn't tell me, I just happened to notice when I picked my phone up and saw the cracks. I do not know what surface it was dropped on or from what height, but I can tell you that the top 2 corners on the protector were chipped and broken and there was several cracks running down it, HOWEVER, no damage to my screen!!! WHAT A HUGE RELIEF. This definitely works and I just ordered a 2nd one, to replace this one that is cracked and damaged.  I attached pictures showing the damage to the phone.",

I have no clue what that is, but it has happened in multiple places. Im guessing I'll want to stop using this case within a few more months if it keeps up the trend.<br /><br />----<br /><br />This case is very cute. I got the gold and it goes nicely with my black phone. It even fits my iPhone 6 just fine! You don't get a ton of protection, but you get some and the back of course will remain scratch free. It's pricey for a case that does offer a lot of protection, but it's a designer case, so it can't be too practical after all. :)",

Delivered ahead of schedule which was great. No scratches or blemishes on the phone at all. This is my 2nd renowned purchase and both were Samsung Galaxy products that were in like new condition.  I would definitely not hesitate to go this route again. Very satisfied.  I also went with the optional drop protection for the screen.  Company is great to work with and it is emailed to you. No issues with the phone so far. If I do I will update. This specific phone was locked to T-mobile which was not an issue for me as that is my carrier.  I would just make sure before purchasing you ck with your carrier to make sure it is compatible with them.",

Looking back, I wish I would've ordered the screen protector and GG adapter, but I was in such a rush to get my pre-order locked.<br />I digress.<br /><br />What I love about amFilm is I get two quality glass screens at an incredibly reasonable price. When amFilm first posted the protectors, they were 9.99 USD for a pack; just a few days later, when I placed my order, the price increased to 11.99 USD. But even at the 2 USD increase, the price is more than justified. The pack comes with the usual: two glass screens, screen-cleaning supplies, and an installation guide. The latter may seem trivial, but I've always referred to it to ensure I get proper installation. Since the time I received the Pocket, I kept the factory plastic protector on the screen. When I was ready to apply the amFilm protector, I simply removed the plastic screen and applied the amFilm protector within seconds. The protector comes with two removable, plastic tabs on either side to aid in application. So far, no noticeable dust or particles. Sweet.<br /><br />The screen protector is so smooth it feels like water. With other devices like the Switch and our mobile devices, this sheen doesn't last long due to constant interaction with skin. I hope, at least, that the Pocket's silky-smooth layer stays on longer. I notice no difference in color between the previous plastic protector and this amFilm one. The edges are rounded off, which looks very handsome on the Pocket. It's like a bubble flattened as much as possible without popping. Nice.",

This meant that, if you had bigger phones, it was a bit awkward to take out. Not so with this mount.<br /><br />The clip holding on the vent loosened once so far. I retightened it and it seems very sturdy now, but I will wait and see.<br /><br />You have to assemble it when it arrives, but if you used multiple mounts in the past it's just like the others: just pop the socket onto the ball joint and tighten it. I can't really seem to move it much once it's completely tight. It's both good and bad. I don't want to have to loosen it every time just to change the angle slightly, but at least now I know it won't come loose while driving.",

I haven't had an iPhone in a while, and the Otterboxes seemed to have perfected that line of phones while Androids are hit and miss. Finally, as I have my Note8, I am able to encase my device with an Otterbox case. I was wondering if the curved screen of my device would be obstructed or cause any interference with the case, but alas it does not!<br /><br />I have a &#34;skin&#34; type screen protector on mine, and it covers the entire screen area. The Otterbox Commuter case does not interfere with it, thankfully. It reaches where it needs to at the bottom and at the sides, and nothing more.<br /><br />The case itself feels nice. It's a nice, matted texture on the hard plastic with a softer, almost rubber-like texture on the inner case. They go on surprisingly easy and didn't interfere with my plastic screen protector. The case I had on before was a Spigen Tough Armor. Spigen is always my default case because they provide aesthetically pleasant cases at a reasonable price, and are usually some of the first to arrive on the scene of a new phone. That case, unfortunately, ate a bit of the screen protector at the bottom. I had a hard time trying to tuck it back in, but it never would.<br />With this case, the bottom lips covers that area perfectly, so no more trying to tuck it back in.<br /><br />It feels great in the hand. The textured main case, while textured, is a bit smooth so it does sometimes feel as though it will sleep out of the fingers if carried loosely. But it's very snug to the form of the phone and doesn't really add much bulk. I used to be a proponent of fatter phones. The phone I had previously was the S5 and I had the Anker battery case, which pretty much tripled the thickness of the phone and quadrupled the weight. I was fine with it because it felt comfortable in the hands, especially when playing games, but it got to be too heavy after long sessions so I opted to use a phone ring with it.<br />With this case, the edges are nice and rounded enough to fit comfortably in the hand, and the size of the phone makes it easier to hold comfortably in adult hands for long sessions, even while remaining relatively thin.<br /><br />I like the color; a nice, deep navy, but I wish it came with more color combinations. I prefer a pop to my phone, but what can you do?<br /><br />Very satisfied with my first Otterbox. I like that the volume keys are separated from the Bixby button, making it much easier to press the volume buttons and avoid pressing the Bixby inadvertently.",

I've been wanting to own a \"premium\" stylus with more accuracy, so I was pretty giddy when this came in the mail.<br /><br />The first thing I tried it on was my Galaxy S5. I know this stylus is touted for the iOS devices, but I wanted to give it a shot anyway. The phone wouldn't recognize the pen, so I enabled Touch Sensitivity and sure enough the stylus worked like any other stylus.<br /><br />Next, I tried it on my iPad 2. I turned on Bluetooth, but the iPad won't detect the stylus. I followed the instructions to the dot, but I'm not sure what the issue is. It could be the stylus, it could be the iPad; I'm guessing it may be my iPad. I'm going to keep trying.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I downloaded two free apps to try it out. Photoshop was one of them as I like to have a doodle app to fiddle with. There was a slight split-second delay between my drawing and when the iPad registered it. That, and the line on the iPad was slightly lower. I'm guessing that once I connect the Bluetooth properly it may be better, but that's what I'm stuck with for now.<br /><br />Immediately after that, I tried it on my S5 again. It worked flawlessly, and I didn't have to turn on Touch Sensitivities. I should note that I have a glass screen protector on my S5 and a plastic one (Otterbox) on my iPad. Not sure whether they make a difference, but it seems important to point that out.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the stylus, but considering the price range I can't recommend it. The tip doesn't stay firm. It slides in a little bit when you press against the screen, though that could be how more accurate styli are. That, and the features the stylus promotes (app connectivity, Evernote, Bluetooth) don't work for me as well as they should, if at all.",

    "text": "When I had an iPhone 5 I had a Belkin battery case that worked great. Sure, the battery life lost its longevity over time, but I never had an issue with it breaking or damaging my iPhone. When I upgraded to an iPhone 6 I knew I had to get a battery case because there was no way I was going to live without one!<br /><br />I was offered a chance to get this and didn't hesitate.<br /><br />When it arrived I immediately loved the way it felt. I'm not sure what the material is, but it has a soft feel to it that makes it easy to grip. There are patterns on the back that run diagonal that also aid to its usability.<br />I initially found the &#34;security&#34; features to be a bit cheesy, but then grew to like them over time. The physical security features are basically just a slider to cover the two cameras. At first I though it unnecessary, but then I realized I often slid the the cover over the compartments when my daughter had my phone. Then I didn't have to worry about her taking pictures with them on.<br /><br />To utilize the main feature of this case, however, you have to slide another lever at the bottom half which holds the battery. The logo of the company indicates the battery life, and by sliding the switch you charge your phone. There's a recessed button to the left of the logo which indicates how much battery life is left in the case itself.<br /><br />However, after a small incident the case was rendered useless.<br />I knew the materials used for the switches felt a bit cheap when I used them but I didn't think much of them because they worked. But yesterday I accidentally dropped the phone from my pocket as I grabbed it; I was in my bathroom so it fell on a soft floor. I'm not a very tall person, so I'd say the drop distance was about 2-3 feet max. When I picked up my phone I found a crack on my phone's screen. Initially I was panicked but then realized that it was of the glass screen protector, which easily can be replaced.<br />Later in the day, after putting my phone on silent, I heard the phone go off during a conversation. I thought it odd and switched it off again. That's when I realized that the switch to put the phone on silent had broken. I had to force it to turn the phone on and off silent.<br /><br />Then, when I was back home and wanted to charge the battery using the case, I realized that the battery slider had broken. Earlier I indicated that, in order to charge the phone by the case, you had to switch a slider at the bottom. Well, that slider slides no more. I tried forcing it to the charge side and it won't budge, not even a smidgen.<br /><br />I'm pretty bummed. Not only did the case not protect my phone from a small fall, but the case itself broke in several places. There was also a small crack in the case near the top. All of that from a short fall onto my bathroom floor.<br /><br />The only major gripe I had before this incident was that the case often came apart. It attaches onto the phone in two pieces, and because I wear somewhat fitted jeans the case usually came apart in my hand when taking out the phone from my pocket. It wasn't a deal-breaker more than it was an inconvenience, but now after yesterday I have many gripes about the phone.<br /><br />I miss my Belkin case from my old phone. Sure, it wasn't the best case I've ever used but at least it prevented my phone from damage from the three small drops I've caused it in two years, all the while keeping a charge over 70%. And it was $40 cheaper than this model, and that's considering I first received the Belkin case two years ago.<br /><br />I'll update this review as time goes on.<br /><br />***UPDATE 7/21/15***<br />I had contacted the company immediately after this review, and they responded the next day. They indicated that they had worked on an update to the case and will send me a replacement. That was over a week ago and I haven't heard back, let alone received the replacement. I contacted them again yesterday to follow up. I will keep this review updated.",

Not a deal breaker, but something to be mindful of if you like using docking devices.<br />A little confusing with the earphone jack placement, but once you figure it out, it's not a problem.",

    "text": "I use this car mount everyday.  It is extremely helpful when wanting to use the GPS system on my iPhone.  It is easy to install and I love the fact that you can position your phone vertically or horizontally.  I was shocked that this mount used the CD slot in order to work, but it does indeed work!  It is slightly inconvenient though when you are trying to change the stations on the radio because the mount and phone block your view of the buttons.  This can become very irritating when driving.  Even with this inconvenience, however, I would recommend this car mount.  It is sturdy, easy to use, and fits my phone nicely.  I continue to use it everyday.  The convenience of having my phone accessible and in view for GPS navigation outweighs the inconvenience of not being able to see the radio stations.",

    "text": "I've been testing this case out for a week and I can say with brutal honesty that Amazon makes some strong competitors with their AmazonBasics line.<br />If you're looking for a \"basic\" case for your iPhone 4 that offers just general protection, this is it.  It's not exactly drop-proof as it is, after all, a thin, soft silicon layer, but it gets the job done.  I have a very similar case ([[ASIN:B003QP423M Amzer Luxe Argyle High Gloss TPU Soft Gel Skin Case for iPhone 4 (Smoke Grey) (Fits AT&T iPhone)]]) that was $3 more when I purchased it, and the AmazonBasics is just as good with the exception of covering the buttons and the Apple logo on back.  I was a bit worried that since it doesn't cover ANY of the buttons it would become a problem, but so far so good.  Only time will tell.<br /><br />The case does have some sharper edges than the Amzer's rounded ones, but it hasn't become a problem yet.  In fact, it actually adds some grip when I play Angry Birds!  I let my father use my phone once and he complained that the case hurt his ear, but I haven't experienced any problems yet myself.<br /><br />AmazonBasics is just that: basic accessories made and sent from Amazon.  If you want a generic case that will save your phone from a small drop, look no further.  If you expect to drop your iPhone from a three-story building without any issues however, then you need a different case.  Or a slap in the face.  Either or.",

    "text": "I really like the concept. Probably me and 3 other people in the US does not have unlimited calling on their cellular plan, I felt like this will be an ideal solution. I would hook this up to my ATA (Analog Telephone Adapter), and set Google Voice to ring the ATA which will send calls to my cellular phone as a Wifi call, or to my cellular number when I'm not in range. This is a great solution, and it worked for a few times.<br /><br />However, the next day, I noticed that my phone was not ringing, instead - I was getting missed Landline call notifications. Everything is fine, it is plugged in, and running, and the app is connected. I used another phone to call myself, and so be it, my cellular phone was not ringing. I go to voicemail, and get the dreaded missed call notification. I contacted support by their message form, and waiting to hear back from them. However, while I loved the concept, it has failed so far to be a practical solution. If I can't get any satisfaction from Invoxia, I will have to return the product, and get my money back.<br /><br />In case anyone wants to know, the phone is a Moto Z Play with Android 7.0",

    "text": "I really wanted to love the phone. Being a purist, and my last two phones being a Nexus, the very heavy Zen UI skin was a little to get used to. Also, the physical capacititve buttons should have been omitted for onscreen buttons. The phone is powerful, and if getting the 64GB model with a 64GB card, you can have 128GB of storage which competes with Samsung and Apple phones for half the price. I am returning the phone the next business day after buying it. The reason of why is for some reason (likely the Asus Phone dialer at fault), the phone will ignore Google Voice. If you use Google Voice, you know that it will dial another number so your GV number can display. This will not work with the ZenFone 2. This is also not just the phone, nor any setting as this seems to be a regular problem with other ZenFone 2 users. Since only my GV number is provided, this phone would not work for me. And yes, there are people that will say use Hangouts dialer, but on cellular, this consumes data, and you don't want hangouts ringing at the same time your phone is ringing.<br /><br />If you rely on Google Voice to make phone calls, simply put, do NOT get this phone. It doesn't matter its specs, or capabilities if the phone won't make a phone call the way you want it too. Oh, I did call Asus support, and they pass the blame game. Considering the large number of reports, I am confident that Asus knows of the problem.",

Once docked, I could then charge my iPhone and also play songs/books from the iPhone through the radio speakers.  Also, the radio controls would operate my iPhone.  Apparently with my new iPhone 4S/case combination, caused it not to dock snuggly and not work with my iPhone docking radios.  I purchased the dock extender cable in anticipation that all would work as it did previously.  The cable appears to make a good connection and the iPhone make a sound when I plug it into the cable.  Unfortunately, the iPhone will no longer play through the radio nor will any of the radio controls work with the iPhone.  I guess I will have to look at getting a different type of docking radio.  Also, I tried a different dock extender cable from another Amazon vendor and it also did not work.  I posted the same review as on another extender cable because they both did the same thing.",

We have dogs that compete and they move so fast it's hard to film them.<br />And now with this gimbal after learning how to use it (think the hardest thing was getting my phone to balance- you definitely can't have a case on your phone) I can finally video my dogs jumping - it's awesome! Plus, I love the time lapse feature- I'll have to come up with something fun to video for that.",

    "title": "UPDATED on rock climbing!!!!!! PERFECT FIT for series 4 Apple Watch!!",
    "text": "Can I get a subscription or bigger pack of these? I love them. And yeah I'm gonna break them. But for the price of these and price of my Apple Watch it's worth it. I use my watch to track climbs so taking off my watch isn't an option. Have broken 6 in 5 months. All from climbing or hitting them on the metal doors at work(still keep on the screen till it's shattered to hell because they have great glue.) my watch is scratch free.<br />Update: The screens really look nice. I can't even tell there is a glass screen protector. I have had ZERO problems with the touch interface. THOUGH as a rock climber I still break these... usually on top rope or lead climbing. Have not broke one bouldering (knock on wood). I have broken three so far in about a months time. They are way more durable than any other screens I've used. And can take a beating of everyday activities. They do not hold up to impact on rock. I still need to be careful when climbing but that's understandable.<br />Once broken they still really really stick to the screen. So I can keep going until I shatter the heck out of it.<br />Again I HIGHLY recommend!<br /><br />Original Post: Best screen so far. It fits tight on the screen and perfect fit around the bevel on the watch. The touch screen works just the same as without it. I've tried multiple screens and unfortunately not many companies make a good glass screen for the series 4 yet since it's still new. This one is by far the best. Havnt went climbing in it yet. But there is no lip around the edge so I feel it'll be more durable.<br /><br />Installing is difficult if you don't have patience. You do need to repeditly lift one edge and push the bubbles out. But that's because of the 3D Touch and bevel on the screen. But trust me you can eventually get them out and they will stay out.<br /><br />Highly recommend.",

And that pin removal adjustment tool is the best bonus/free/included item I might have every received. I have a very elaborate watch kit for case/battery/band adjustments. And the pin tool included in this kit was silver lining to setting up this watch band set. I would recommend all users of the tool to rub a candle on the threads to ease use of the tool.<br /><br />If you have the Pixel Watch, hate silicone bands and like the metal band style. This might be the only feasible option till the market decides if the Pixel is worth making nicer accessories for.

I have not seen any way to rotate screen while the watch charges on its side. Also should mention I use a men's stainless metal watch band and it does not affect the charger. The basic Pixel silicone bands are no issue either. This charger block stays put on all flat surfaces.<br />I may still 3D print something a bit fancier.

And this is part of why she never replies to messages or answers calls.

It's also a great way to see incoming notifications and calls while she watches TV. While she has many other colors. She uses and raves about this purple one and had me buy more to give to the nurses who help her with daily needs.<br /><br />Long story short. Buy a color they love, and you might get older users to adopt an upright stand to help them see what they are missing when their phones are beeping and booping.",

Once you get it into a shape you like. You should be set, as long as you don't mess with it repeatedly. I saw many reviews with these broken at either end. Mine is wrapped around my couch arm. I tried to make the bends a couple inches away from the ends to keep the clamp end and phone ends straight as to not stress them too much. This model is far superior to the other 3 I paid about the same price for. It is longer, and much stiffer.<br />Many other options and there might be better versions. And time will tell if mine breaks like others have had happen. For now, it's a decent purchase. Kind of wish for the price it included the car style clamp as well.

I have an iPhone 8+ and it worked well. I'm giving this 3 stars because after 2-3 weeks, the ring became really loose and somewhat defeated the purpose. Another issue was that the bat symbol is actually really sharp around the edges in some spots because it's made of metal. It's not a big deal, just a little annoying. Finally, with the ring, your phone will never lay flat by any means because the connector for the ring is tiny and slightly taller than the rest of the gadget. With a pop socket, your phone has 1.5 inches of flat surface area to rest on so you don't have this issue, so if your phone is on a table or something it's really annoying to text or even switch songs because the phone will just wobble so much.

They emailed me after i contacted them about the shipment. I paid for 2 days of shipment to received the product 5 days after the promised date. I'm sure their shipment will be more stable/reliable later on, i'd give 0 star for their shipping.<br /><br />Product: So i put my iphone 6 plus in the case and it fits well. Material seems like nice. While they are not the expensive real leather, they feel soft/smooth. Magnet holder works well, both ways. After i put my phone and 4 cards the case gets a little fat but it still closes well. I've ordered the other brand with similar design(that one's suppose to be the best seller?) and with the same number of cards inside, it didn't close. I am returning that one and keeping this one.<br />Buttons are accessible without any issue and stand functions well.<br />It measures about 6.5 inches x 3.4 inches x 0.5 inches when closed.",

    "text": "I get a bit when a product says it will brighten skin. Years ago, my sister used a skin brightening cream under her eyes that made her look like a raccoon. lololol.  Thankfully, that doesn't happen with Alteya's Organic Eye Cream. I like the consistency of the cream; at first I thought it appeared to be a bit on the thicker side but that's not the case. Its nice and lightweight, VERY easy to apply (a little truly does go a LONG way!) and absorption is fast.  No greasy/oily look or feel is left behind.  Adds much needed moisture to the skin under and around my eyes, replaces dark circles /puffiness with some brightening while reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  It feels nice while being applied, as it absorbs and after absorption is completed. I have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues with the cream.<br /><br />There is a rose scent that I find to be very strong.  I'm not a fan of most things rose scented and that includes this cream. But it doesn't take very long before the scent is undetectable to me.<br /><br />I never heard of the Alteya brand before but now, I'm a huge fan of this eye cream.  I love the results it delivers and does so quickly.  The jar contains  0.51oz. I know that doesn't sound like much but I stress that VERY little cream is needed to adequately cover the area around the eyes. I use this twice a day , this jar will still last me a LONG time.  I find the price reasonable. I'm not deducting stars from my overall rating with regards to the strong rose scent since its no longer detectable to me after a short amount of time.",

Frustrating doesn't even begin to describe it.<br /><br />Then I found this beauty from Andobil! I am *extremely* pleased to share that this mount does indeed mount securely to the round type air vents found in Ford F-150 trucks and remains attached and stable even when driving on dirt roads and two tracks! In fact, I was so happy with this purchase that I literally did the Walter Houston dance! Ha! Since I only installed it a few days ago, I cannot speak to the durability of it yet but it seems as if it is well built and should hold up for quite some time for us.

First off, it adjusts and holds my Galaxy S10 (and previously held my Galaxy S8 and Droid Turbo) nice and tight. A lot of my driving includes \"turn off the paved road\" which results in quite a few bumpy stretches and this charger holds on so tight there is barely any noticeable movement. Due to the depth and shape of my dash, I can't use the included dash mount plate so I will not be including that install method in my review. I can say, however, that the air vent clip is magnificent! It latches on and doesn't move. The wireless charging works flawlessly. And the auto open and close feature is a dream! The only downside I've found with this setup is that the auto open and close feature will refuse to operate if the ambient temperature is below 40f. At those times, I just put my phone in the center console and after a few minutes of running the heater the charger has warmed up enough that the auto open and close feature will operate again.",

    "text": "The PureGear fits my Turbo BN perfectly. I am quite pleased with all aspects of this case. The precision cuts for the camera/flash/sensor/speakers on the rear of the case are perfect. As are the cutouts for the headphones jack and charging port. The aesthetics of my BN finish are not covered which is one of the main reasons I wanted to give this case a try. The PureGear puts my BN backing on display nicely. (Now if I could just figure out how to remove the Verizon logo from the BN back.. it appears to be similar to an iron-on patch or whatnot. I've noticed some Turbo BN phones do not even have the VZW logo. Would be wonderful if someone has removed this and take a few moments to explain the process to me!)<br /><br />From my experience with cases for past phones, this is extremely thin and lightweight. It doesn't appear to add much bulk, if any. With eyes closed, I wouldn't even realize a case was on my Turbo except for the grippy plastic feeling. A major bonus for me as the Turbo is pushing the limits of my female hands when it's naked, let alone in a case.<br /><br />As for slipperiness, which I know is an issue most have with the clear cases... check out the picture below. I tried to take a picture of the back of my hand to emphasize the angle the phone is at, but I about dropped my phone, lol. Suffice it to say, in this picture, the phone in the PureGear case is resting on my palm.. no fingers are gripping it nor is a corner resting on my palm.. absolutely no support is provided to the phone/case combo. My hand is at about a 85 degree angle and the case is not slipping. Needless to say, I am pleased with the no-slip-grip it seems to have. Granted, if you put this on a slick surface, like a book, binder or arm of the couch.. then yes, it will glide right off. To me however, it is the grip in hand that counts and so far it's got it where it counts. lol<br /><br />Only issues I have noticed..<br /><br />It is rather difficult to remove once it's on the phone. This may ease over time and use. However, on the other hand, it is also a comfort knowing that it is on my phone snug and won't slip off on a corner like some other cases for the Turbo BN are known to do.<br /><br />Also, the power button responds without much extra effort but the volume buttons/rocker is another story. I have to press harder than I believe I should to get any reaction from them. Hopefully, like with the difficulty of removing the case, the stiffness in the buttons will relax over time as well.<br /><br />Neither of these issues are deal breakers for me. I still love the case and the appearance of my phone in it. Overall, I would deduct only 1/2 a star, if I could, for these. As it is, I'll rate it as a 5 here as I don't see these issues as being bad enough to merit a full star reduction.<br /><br />Since I am a case fanatic, I will certainly be ordering a few others so I can swap them out depending on my mood (actually eyeballing the clear/black option from PureGear right now). But the PureGear clear/clear will remain in my arsenal and for now will serve as permanent case. Personally, I give it 4.5 stars (reduced due to the slight difficulty of removing it).",

    "title": "Finally a holder that works",
    "text": "Installed in my 2012 Dodge Ram 1500<br /><br />Ever since I got my new Droid Razr Maxx, I have been searching for a holder for it to use in my truck on longer drives. This item fills the bill perfectly. The base can be twisted to expand and contract making it easy to fit just about any cup holder. My phone fits between the arms fine, even in its case which is nice not having to remove that. And the arms, and back panel, are padded so if you happen to not have a case on your phone, then it should not scratch it much, if at all. The upper part rotates allowing you to view your phone in profile or landscape mode. The gooseneck is tight and difficult to position - I admit that I thought I was going to break it at first. But once you give it a little more elbow grease, it will budge and allow you to aim it at the angle that works for you. I especially like the arm release button which makes removing my phone from the arms quick and easy. With my phone installed and the holder installed in one of my center console cup holders, this holder does not bounce, shimmy, shake or move whatsoever while my truck is in motion. A major plus! All in all, a great purchase that I recommend.",

    "title": "The best tips, but very short",
    "text": "After receiving my first Kindle (and first tablet) for Christmas, I had to do research on what the best stylus' were. I learned there are different tips available and how they differed from one another. I quickly leaned toward the micro-fiber tip as I like the reports and claims of not requiring as much force to be recognized on the screen. I purchased this set as I couldn't decided which color to get and am pleased with my purchase. The colors are vibrant and the tips glide effortlessly and beautifully across my Kindle's screen.<br /><br />My only complaints about this set are:<br />#1 The clips are not very tight making it very easy for the pen to slip off of whatever you 'clip' it to.<br />#2 The length is a bit short and I have found small blisters forming on my hand as the pen is shorter than normal pens which causes me to hold it unusually.<br /><br />For now, these pens are fulfilling my needs, however I am on the hunt for a similar micro fiber tipped stylus that is a bit longer.<br /><br />***UPDATE 2/4/2014***<br />The seller sent me a complimentary set of these stylus' [[ASIN:B00D9JH7MI The Friendly Swede (TM) Bundle of 2 Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip Capacitive Stylus Pens 5.2\" + 4 x 15'' Rubberized Steel and Elastic Tether Lanyards + Cleaning Cloth (Zebra Hot Pink + Purple)]] after they read my review above.<br /><br />The customer service is beyond superb with this seller. So rest assured that if you make a purchase from them and you are not satisfied, they will work with you to fix the situation or issue. And very quickly, I might add!<br /><br />This new set has answered my aforementioned issues with the clip and length. The clips on the new set are much more superior in both design and weight and they actually stay clipped on whatever you clip them to. They are also longer and I have learned that my hands require the longer length when it comes to stylus'. The weight of the new set is also more substantial. It feels like I am nearly holding a regular ink pen and not grasping onto air. All of this together equals, to me, a more superior product overall and one that I will both recommend to others and purchase in the future should the need arise.",

I thought it would be best to post my review here as well since this is identical to my purchase but the inclusion of the holster.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My husband and I both have a Droid Razr Maxx. His was purchased October 2, 2012 and mine was purchased March 21, 2013.<br /><br />We originally purchased two [[ASIN:B006WC0U4G Otterbox Commuter Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]] as I had an Otterbox on my previous phone (a Droid Incredible 2) and loved it. The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.<br /><br />After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all. The cases purchased and compared were:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00829HLZS Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0077IQA2K Trident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007KZQNP4 Seidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br />&<br />[[ASIN:B007UNHTSG Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-PR ACTIVE Case and Holster Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Combo Pack - Retail Packaging - Amethyst]]<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />First, the Asmyna:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It is easy to 'install'.<br />-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.<br />-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.<br />-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.<br />-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.<br />-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.<br />-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Trident Aegis:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy, two part design.<br />-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.<br />-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.<br />-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.<br />-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, he got to keep the black version (we returned the other three reviewed above) and I purchased and received this purple version for my phone (I prefer a color that stands out more than the over-popular black).<br /><br />The purple color of my case is extremely close to what is depicted here on Amazon. It does appear slightly lighter though and seems to have a more metallic appearance than pictured here. But this could easily be attributed to resolution differences which varies from computer to computer. If this is a color that you are interested in purchasing, just know that there is very little difference between the online picture and the actual case in hand. It took me holding my phone next to the picture here to notice any difference.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",

This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",

This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",

I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",

I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",

    "text": "Purchased for my husband to use with his Droid Razr Maxx. He is very tough on cases and this one seemed capable of standing up to his active work days. The phone fits well when naked (no case). I purchased a TPU cover for him which was put on the phone and then put the phone in this holster. Technically, it fits.. but it is a royal pain to remove from the holster now. He knows he must have a protective cover of some kind on his phone and he really prefers the holster style case.. so our search continues for the best combination for him. I gave it 3 stars because it does work, but docked 2 stars as it will not accomodate the Maxx with any cover on it (which the majority of the population do prefer).<br /><br />Bottom line: this case does indeed fit the Droid Razr Maxx very well. It simply does not leave any room for a protective cover to be simultaneously installed on the phone.",

    "text": "Purchased 2 Otterbox Commuter Cases for both my husband's Razr Maxx and mine. Just received them.. and I got mine on without too much hassle. The inner rubber layer required a little wiggling to get the port protection flaps to lay just right and getting the phone (with the inner layer on) into the hard outer shell took a bit of coercing, but that proved to me that this case is fit perfectly for my phone, as described.<br /><br />The number one feature of this case that I absolutely love and appreciate is that the charging location is fully accessible *without* having to remove the case. I have had too many cases for other phones in the past which required the case be removed in order to charge the phone. I also like the company's warranty. I hope I never have to use it. but glad it's there for that unplanned catastrophic event. Thank you, Otterbox!<br /><br />I see this case serving as a wonderful protector for my expensive Razr Maxx for as long as I have it.. but I will update this review if any problems come up. From what I have experienced with my Otterbox Commuter Case so far.. I would highly recommend it mainly for the superb fit, charging access and the company's lifetime warranty.<br /><br />Update:<br />My husband and I have come to terms with our Otterbox cases. They are simply too thick and add too much bulk to an already sizable phone. Also, the silicone port covers/flaps have stopped seating properly and have began to tear off from the rest of the inner silicone liner (and this is without ever removing the case after first receiving it - so I know it is not caused by repeated installs and removals).. they pop out of place all the time when removing the phone from a purse or a holster which has lead to a noticeable amount of dust build up in the ports they were meant to protect.<br /><br />We have removed them from our phones and, after lengthy research and ordering multiple other cases, we have settled on the following cases as our replacements:<br /><br />Husband's Razr Maxx - [[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br />My Razr Maxx - [[ASIN:B007UNHTSG Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-PR ACTIVE Case and Holster Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Combo Pack - Retail Packaging - Amethyst]]<br /><br />I love that we were able to find suitable, and comparable, cases that are offered in a choice of colors. Something that I have been waiting for Otterbox to do, but it seems that they will have no plans of ever doing for any phone other than a very select few. This makes is possible to, at a glance, differentiate between our two otherwise identical phones.",

This screen cover snaps on and completely encases the screen safely, then the protective back fits right over the phone. To me, this is the PERFECT CASE AND SCREEN COVER.

The cover is quite thick and I knew if it didn't take the charge through it, I would need to return the charging pad. But it does and that makes for an easy charge. If you choose to, you can plug the charger into a 'fast charge adapter', such as the one that came with my phone originally and get the charge faster if you need to. But with this pad, I avoid the need to plug the phone into the bedroom charger, or remove the plug and bring it into the living room where I need it. For me, this is perfect.",

I bought it for my gal and she's really tough on phones - landscaper that keeps it in her hip cargo pocket.  Her complaint is that her cards fall out if she's not careful and that really shouldn't be.... but, if you're looking for a cheap product to carry your phone around protected, this product looks great too.  Slots are probably better for business cards or something you're fine with losing.  Otherwise I'd say good purchase.",

If you buy it, it will break the first time you drop your phone on it's face or hit it on its edge.  That's what it's supposed to do!  It absorbs the energy so your phone's actual touchscreen doesn't.<br /><br />The warranty replacement is somewhat confusing so let me make it simple.  The warranty is for 2 replacements per purchase.  When something happens to your screen protector don't throw away the old screen protector before you take a picture of it!!!!  The seller or manufacturer wants to see a picture of the broken screen protector (see mine above).",

It will likely be easier to use than this one. Someone thought this was a good idea. Just looking at it, I don't think it lives up to that good idea.

I used a ball to ball adapter because this was extraordinary inexpensive when I ordered it. Using the phone holder from an Arkon phone mount with my Galaxy S9, it allows me to have the phone father from the dash, and easier to reach. It works fine with both, but it really isn't any more solid. The suction cup is larger, so it doesn't fit in the same space. All of the Arkon sticky mounts work well on slightly textured plastic. They work too well on glass. I honestly haven't found any suction mount that works as well on the dash of a commercial truck.",

My ear fits these too well.<br /><br />Be aware that this headset appears to no longer be fully supported online. Plantronics is now Poly. I just downloaded the latest version of Plantronics Hub from Poly's support site, which appears to be the remnants of Plantronics support site. When I run the Plantronics Hub and try to update the headset I get, \"Plantronics Hub is unable to connect to the server.\" I suspect that the update server no longer exists, though I can't be sure. The most recent firmware version is v.109, and may be the last one. That doesn't take away from the quality and usefulness of the headset at all. It's still the best noise-cancelling headset I can comfortably wear. Driving a truck I wear one all the time.<br /><br />Having said all that, I have had issues with some of the ones I've purchased more recently, and my wife has too. Some of them don't cancel noise as well as others, though they all come up as the same product, and the same firmware version. Early on, they were all flawless. Lately, they're not. We've had a couple that failed before we managed to destroy them ourselves. And it's possible that more modern devices don't connect as well to the older version of bluetooth these support. This is a very good legacy product.<br /><br />Last note: My wife has one of the newer 5200s, and didn't like it nearly as well as these.",
