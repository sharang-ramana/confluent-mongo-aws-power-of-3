The YouTube video helped a ton with installing the new screen. Highly recommend using a how to video when replacing your screen. The tools and supplies they provided were adequate. I did use additional tools from my home to successfully installed a new screen. My screws on the inside of the iPhone were stuck and I had to use an X-Acto knife to get them to come out. The glass Screen for the iPhone was beautiful and worked great. The screen protector that was additional came cracked (Not a big deal as it was extra in my eyes). I did need to use the X-Acto knife to cut off part of a plastic piece to make the final fit. So yes I modified the screen and instructions but ended up working great for me.<br /><br />I was very careful with all of the circuit boards and connections as recommended on the YouTube video. My screen replacement was very successful and I'm very happy with how it turned out.",

    "text": "This shouldn't be called a phone case!! Is doesn't have any designated spots for side buttons so although it “fits” it's left feeling janky poor quality and wiggly with every use of th side buttons or too much pressure from your hands. I have kids this will result in my phone getting broken because it barely keeps my phone secure. The only good thing is it's semi cute but even the word boys is cut out to ensure room for the camera. So if I could report under 1 start and y'all see this then I would but I wanted y'all to at least be able to see an honest iPods for review",

To my surprise it was! Super easy to install (unlike the last one), fits and adjusted to my wrist perfectly. The band (although rubber type as well) has a great ribbed look which makes it look different and fashionable. I got it in white and it looks great with the red face of my iwatch.

A few days after I tried it again and IT WORKED, I was so happy.  I mean it cost enough it should work ... right? I am absolutely happy now!",

I didn't believe him hen he said it charged his phone in less than an hour. I plugged my phone in at 27% and within 45 minutes it was already at 60% reported charge (Samsung Galaxy S5 active (2800 mAh).  Of course I know that will drop a bit once it's taken off the charger but I think this will work perfectly for his trip. As other reviewers have mentioned the pocket is useless for anything other than the included cable.  What I found to work best was used that flap to make a tent of sort of one of the solar panels and place the phone under there in the shade so the battery wouldn't get too hot from sitting in the sun.  this worked great in that configuration. It will also work good to strap it to top of his backpack and get a longer cable to place battery pack inside the top pocket of his pack to be able to take advantage of the sunny spots on the trail.  All in all, I would certainly recommend this charger to anyone looking for a lightweight powerhouse of a solar charger.",

I chose the pink - which darker than shown in photos - more of a peptobismal type pink - because that color was in stock - others I would have preferred were out of stock.  It feels like a poured, solid form.  Has a little weight to it.  You could put it in your purse if you carry a pretty big purse.  It holds my phone either standing upright or on it's side.  The only thing I will note is that the base of the holder needs a little something to keep it from sliding around a bit.  It is a plastic of some sort - but it feels like a really dense rubber like substance (?) - not sure.  Was hoping it wouldn't slide around, but it does. I am thinking of gluing a little non skid material to the bottom.  On the flip side, if you want it to slide around, it does!  All in all, it's handy for my purpose.

I hold the phone in my left hand, using the pop up grip and use my right hand to navigate and use my phone... I am not a \"thumber\"  You can stand you phone up with this one.. it pops out in about 3 different heights.. I like that because I can keep my phone off the table or other surfaces that might not be clean.  The design I chose sort of matches my cover... the ONE down side is that I cannot use my cordless charger.. for whatever reason, I am guessing it's because the grip lifts is just enough off the stand and it doesn't make contact.  Eh.  I got tired of taking my cover on and off every night, so I went back to cord charging.  I purchased another cover so I could go back to the cordless charger and not use the grip - but for now I am liking it.  I don't spend a huge amount of time staring at my phone (I don't twitter, you tube, etc).. but if you do, these really do relieve some tendon stress in my opinion.  Another note: once you peel off the sticker and place it on your outer case, whatever that is, you will NOT be removing it or moving the grip.  It's on - permanently.

Here's the thing... the best part about this cover print?  Its printed on the INSIDE!!  That means the print will STAY on a LOT longer than those that are printed on the outside of the case.  Trust me on this.  In any case, I am thrilled that the print I loved for all these years, the reliability of the case and funtionality is still available to me.  I have the black phone.  So the print really shows nicely.  I mostly use wireless charging platforms, and it easily charges through the case without any issue. When I have plugged into the phone with my car cord, no issues - stays plugged in while in the case. LITTLE TIP:  I actually put the little SD \"key\" inside the case as it usually gets lost -  it fits easily inside the case, is fairly hidden in the print and doesn't move around.  The case is firm, but not brittle plastic.. it's a bit rubbery so it fits the phone perfectly and protects from the daily bumps and grinds with a little lip/edge and reinforced at the corners.

In my use... the light board takes very little power so it lasts and lasts and lasts.

It is about the size of a deck of cards - maybe slightly larger.

You can set the easel back to any position that works using the side button (on the top of the easel - left hand side).  It is a flat black in color. The only other thing I could say about it is that is fairly heavy.  I had a pouch from something else and I drop into that to carry about.

I purchased my first one of these at the Sprint Store when I purchased my Galaxy 7 a month ago. I do love the ease and FAST charging ability. My phone is fully charged in about 1 hour. I purchased the black, two of them through Amazon. They both arrived with WHITE cords.... odd..... ?? The cords have a mini usb tip on one side, you plug into the stand itself (or, in a pinch directly into your phone - although it wouldn't be a &#34;fast charge I don't think), the other end is a large usb tip that can be plugged into a computer, or other large usb charging receptacle OR to the wall unit that works in a regular plug in. The cord feels sturdy so it should last. It's about 2ft in length - just eyeballing it. It doesn't seem to effect the charging ability that the cord color doesn't match the base... I noticed that the one I purchased from Sprint had matching color cord... and is silent (there is a small fan). One of the these is a bit noisier - you can hear the fan every so often. So I just moved that one away from the bedroom. Honestly I am suspicious of them - ... but they do work and nothing has caught fire ... yet. I would use caution.",

The holder itself is black.  It has a sticky, suction base.  The base has 2 adjustment spots...both are twist/screw type...  loosen, adjust and then tighten.  The top adjustment is like a ball swivel with a small amount of swivel.  The actual grabber area is interesting... you push in two tabs on opposite sides and the grippers pop open.  There is a &#34;button&#34; like knob in the center so that when you place your phone in the cradle it snaps the side pieces in place, grabbing and holding the phone.  I find that the side buttons sometimes are not very &#34;positive&#34; and you need to press them both equally at the same time or you will need to press the center button to reset and press again to get your phone positioned properly in the holding area.  There is also a loose, free moving bottom &#34;lip&#34; or &#34;edge&#34; that helps to hold the phone in place.  The circular base bottom is very, very sticky and has a reverse pressure lever.  It is VERY solid.<br />I was disappointed to see that the box I received had been opened and the item had been &#34;used.&#34;  That being said, it does work.  But I should have been sold a &#34;used&#34; product at a &#34;used price&#34; rather than the new price I paid.<br />I have included pics to help the honest buyer.

It is &#34;matte&#34; finished, sort of leather &#34;like.&#34;  The inside is a plastic-like material, no way to really see if the outside is leather or just a textured plastic itself.  It does fit, all the slots and holes are accurate. I have a sparkle/clear outer case (purchased at the Sprint store when I got the phone) that I use over the whole backside that provides a rubber bumper that covers the edges completely and then the outer plastic cover also provides a &#34;lip&#34; that protects the glass if the phone is dropped.  The pink shows through nicely, tho it is a very light pink. I think the photo is fairly close to reality (at least to the one I received). In my opinion, you'll be paying $70 for a back that is worth about $5 and that is being very generous.  Honestly, I would pass unless you just really want the &#34;look&#34; they advertise on TV all the time.  However reviews are ALL subjective and personal.

    "text": "This is an update AFTER I have purchased the honor 8 (with a heavy discount from manufacturer)<br /><br />Everything else is as most people have observed: quality build, smooth, ample memory ...<br /><br />However, one BIG complaint I have is the dual sim - Huawei's own manual (on model FRD-L04) says it CAN be used as dual-sim (or one sim and one sd card), numerous reviews said it support dual-sim, but it doesn't from what I can tell.<br /><br />why Huawei doesn't support more LTE bands, just like they do on Mate 9??<br /><br />Another issue is with dual camera - the wide aperture is a great misnomer, wide aperture on smart phone won't give you the bokeh effect, iphone's &#34;portrait&#34; mode is much easier on usability.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I bought Honor 5x as soon as it was out on Amazon: it was a good value proposition at the time. Not so for Honor 8.<br /><br />Honor 8 - I have hands-on experience, it is a step-up from Honor 5x, but not a $200 or double-priced step up.<br />Most folks who bought the Huawei phone are not because it is really better than iPhone at half the price (though I am sure Huawei wants you to think that way). Yes, it is beautifully designed, and I like 5.2 form factor more than 5.5. The dual camera is nice - but it is not pulling ahead of either iPhone or Samsung. All in all, a good step-up from Honor 5x released in US. That comes to my second point - it is an overpriced phone.<br /><br />The same phone or other similarly configured phone (from Xiaomi, Le2 etc) will cost about $50 to $100 less, which is significant in this price range. Huawei set this price simply because they can (and a bit greedy since this is US market). No other its fellow competitors from home  have released their phones in the US, yet. There maybe some pride on Huawei's part on about its reputation and quality that they think worth the extra. This is not so in my mind: I haven't seen any phone other than iPhone that can enjoy software update for more than 3 years, and hardware can withstand it. Given my experience with Honor 5x, Huawei is no exception either.  The bottom line is, I think this is over-priced phone, a bit over 300 or even 350 would have made its name and be more competitive.",

On the plus side:<br /><br />- Speedy finger prints (suffered from Samsung Tab S's clumsy and unreliable swipe finger print, this is heaven.)<br />- Good battery standby (2% decrease overnight)<br /><br />On the minus side, when I take a phone call, the screen goes complete dark and can't bring it back by touching (you can get it back by click the power key), also the speaker voice sometimes feels tapering off ... need more time to get used to; Also, the default system font feels weird, so it is thin and small, and doesn't match with the rest of the fonts.<br /><br />Bottom line: the best in its class. Hoping for Marshmallow update.<br /><br />Update: after a month, Honor 5X received its first update and it is a letdown ... First, the update itself is a 125MB package without any note on what it is for; Second, and more important to the take off of one star: after the update, two apps are added and put on, both seems to be advertisement, one is hotel booking, the other is a link to store. I think this is really a low play for such a nice phone. For some company like Huawei aspiring to be international and a premium brand, whatever the revenue coming with these two ad. app (which btw a common practice among Chinese mobile vendors) are just *NOT* worth it.",

I hear that the GPU (graphics processing unit) isn't as zippy as the one in Samsung's S6. But, I don't use it for gaming. Might use it for videos down the road. It's like a very small phablet, light enough that you can hold it for an hour or more late at night if you want to catch up on reading or dash off emails you couldn't get to during the day. The screen is super sharp! I've used it heavily on wifi for 2-3 hours at a time, which only drains the battery about 30%. Not bad. What a phone!",

Americans make their cars for 12 volts. I took this could from our American car to Europe, and so I found out it does not work, you have to order a plugin from your dealer which he orders from Europe. I own a Mercedes, VW GTI never used it in these cars only in my American made car. This will solve a lot of problems for you people with foreign cars it is not the plugin it is the European car. I hope this helps. Never take one to other countries or use it only in an American car. ( My husband has to plug his oxygen machine into the outlet and I used it for my phone in our Ford.

I bought another one (different brand) in a different color and there is a big difference in the material, the new one is already starting to look warped and stretched out.<br /><br />Full disclosure, I just got this so I can't remark on how durable it is but I like it so much that I came to look at the other designs. I came across those stretchy $25 watch bands with similar designs and couldn't see myself paying that much for an Apple Watch band and decided to take a chance on this and am glad I did. It's super comfortable, was easy to put on and fits great. It feels so much better than a sticky silicone band.",

    "text": "This phone is cheap. It runs an ancient version of Android, can barely run an app and make a phone call at the same time, and is losing compatibility with some basic apps that I used to use every day (e.g. banking). On top of all of this, the sound quality is fair at best, and you can't run bluetooth and wifi at the same time without them interfering with each other (they sit on the same chip).<br /><br />Despite all of the negative remarks above, I have had this phone for 3 years. 3 years! I've never had a phone last that long, let alone one I bought for $60 with no contract. It takes a beating, and still delivers in some key areas:<br /><br />First, the battery. This battery is insane (probably because the processor is so weak it doesn't draw any power...). I can forget to charge the phone overnight, and I'll still have a charge the next afternoon.<br /><br />Second, the durability. I have dropped this phone more times than I can count. Heck, I've even thrown it against the wall to prove a point to gloating iPhone owners. In spite of all that, it keeps ticking. Small cracks on the back cover are the only sign of wear. With the beating I give it, I would expect  it to look like Humpty Dumpty (post-fall).<br /><br />Lastly, size. This phone is very small for a smart phone. It's so cheap I don't bother with a case, and it fits very easily in a hand or pocket.<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />This is a great cheap phone. In spite of all of its shortcomings, it can call, text, and send emails. It can even load simple web pages (good luck if there are ads though...). If you just want a sturdy little phone that will get you through the day and then some, this is a fine choice. However, if you rely on apps, need to make business calls, or want a fancy gadget, you will be seriously disappointed.",

    "text": "This is the first OtterBox case I have tried.  The quality seems quite good and case fits good around the Samsung Note 8 phone.  A couple of cases I tried before seemed to come up around the edges too much, so that you couldn't use a glass protector, as the case would interfere with the protector and it would not sit tight to the glass.  This case seems to be designed in such a way that you could use a glass protector.  The problem is that because the case doesn't really cover the edges that well, if you were to drop the phone on the edge, it might break the glass. (Glass replacement for this phone is about $400 I have been told.)  I prefer a case that has a cover too, rather than a one sided case like this.  The problem with cases with a cover is that you always have to deal with the cover.  It can be a separate piece that you have to set aside when using the phone or a billfold type that you open up and then the cover is in your way when taking pictures.  If you like single sided cases so that your phone is always open for use, this is probably one of the best you can get.",

    "text": "This is a really nice case that holds a picture ID and several credit cards and provides an easy fold cover to protect the screen with a magnet to hold it closed. It is almost like a folding wallet.  If you have this phone (Note 8), you know that the glass is curved on the edges, so it is difficult to find a screen protector that doesn't provide full coverage and doesn't go around the curved edges.  The problem with a full coverage glass protector is that just about any case that you try needs to press against the sides of the glass to hold the phone properly.  That creates a problem because the pressure of a case on the sides raises the protector off the surface of the glass.  With this case, you don't absolutely need a screen protector, as you have protection once the case is closed.  I have tried two other cases and so far I like this the best of the three.  The case is nice and thick, but soft leather, so should provide enough protection without the weight that a hard cover case would have.  I like it a lot and if this wears out, I'll buy the same case again.",

The only question is whether or not it provides adequate protection.  I noticed that the rounded glass face on the Note 8 sticks slightly above the edge of this case.  If the phone were dropped on its face, the face could probably crack because of this.  Naturally I didn't try it to find out.  I generally prefer cases that have a cover, to provide much better protection of the face of the phone, which is more prone to breaking than other parts of the phone.  This is a single part case that essentially protects sides, ends and back of the phone, but seems to not provide much protection for the front of the phone.",

    "text": "I ordered this for my LG G Stylo phone, but it was designed for a Stylo 2, which is apparently just slightly different.  It does fit my phone, but it partially covers the camera flash and completely covers the laser detection auto focus. I believe it also covers the headphone jack. All the other holes line up okay (microphone, charging port, speaker and hole for the stylus).  All the front openings are available because this is a one-sided case.  If you don't use the camera that much or the headphone jack (which I don't), you could make it work.  It is very rigid, so it seems as if it would be very durable and long lasting.  Because it is a completely rigid case, it was a little difficult to slip the phone into it and I may have cracked the back cover of the phone (the battery cover).  It's possible that it was already cracked from dropping the phone a few times, but I know I made several of the cracks worse putting it in the case and then removing the case.  When I first removed the case, it pulled the back off the phone, in fact.  Possibly the fit might not be quite as tight on a Stylo 2, but if it was not a good firm fit, the case would not stay in place.  My suggestion - once you have it in the case, don't remove it, unless you have to in order to get to the battery or memory card inside your phone.  The only thing that I really didn't like is that this is a one sided case that covers only the back, ends and side of the phone but not the front.  My current case has a cover, to cover the front of the phone as well, so it protects it much better.  My attempts to fit this case to a phone that it wasn't quite designed for should not impact your decision to buy this case.  All I would say is to just be careful inserting it into the case, so as not to flex the phone at all, which might crack the back phone cover (the battery cover) as it did mine.

I will have to take an additional wallet with me to hold all my cards. Three slots are not enough. The magnetic side is also not strong enough. Again, I've had other wallets that grip the phone when reconnected. This one feels not as strong. However, the snap closure prevents the phone from detaching in a fall which helps. So, I try not walk around  too much with it open. The case itself is thin enough to allow QI charging on the pad and in my vehicle. I can drop it in to the slot and it fits allows for fast charging. Finally, the case feels like leather. I know that it's not but it's not plastic-y.<br />If it had enough slots to replace a normal wallet it would be perfect, but I will still give it 5 stars.",

    "text": "I preordered mine and received it on Sept. 19, the same day my iPhone 6 arrived. The color (I chose champagne / champagne) matches the phone perfectly. The case is very light with a sleek profile that makes you forget it's a case at all. Finishing is excellent; there are no rough seams, corners, or edges. After reading that several people had issues with Elago Outfit cases scratching their iPhone 5, I left the protective film on the back of my phone just in case, but don't plan on removing this case until I trade my phone in in a year or two.<br /><br />At first, I was worried that the thin plastic around the volume / power button might crack, but I've been using it for a month and it is as sturdy as the day I put it on the phone. There is also supposed to be a special coating that repels dirt and fingerprints, and I've been setting my phone down on multiple surfaces and it looks brand-new. If you see smudges / fingerprints on the aluminum panel, simply wipe down with a soft cloth and you're good to go.<br /><br />The one design feature I'm not crazy about is the fact that the top is left open; the bottom gives plenty of access to the speaker, headphone jack and adapter, and clearly Elago knew the power button had shifted from the top to the right, so I'm a bit confused why the top edge was left completely unprotected, as it seems likely that this is the surface that will hit first when dropped. The case does have a slight lip on the front, so you can set your phone face-down without worries about scratching the screen, but having the top edge enclosed would have made this a great case (so far the phone hasn't gotten scratched on the exposed edge, but I've been pretty careful with it).<br /><br />Things I like:<br />+ The case is made in Korea, not China.<br />+ Elago wrote a follow-up e-mail to ask how I liked my purchase.<br />+ Elago included several free gifts (a screen protector, cleaning cloth, and a car charger adapter) and a thank you note!<br />+ Smooth finishing (edges, corners, inside) means less chance of scratching your phone<br /><br />Things I'd improve:<br />- Enclose the top edge; since there are no buttons / jacks on top anymore, I can't see a reason for leaving the top edge of your phone / screen exposed to drops / cracks / scratches.<br /><br />Otherwise this is an excellent case and I would definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "A friend in London (England, not Ontario) convinced me that I had to see \"Bend It Like Beckham,\" (along with praise from Sundance and the Toronto Film Festival) so lo and behold, one dreary spring day I stepped into a surprisingly crowded theatre (I wasn't sure of a British comedy's marketability in North America). \"BILB\" proved every bit as wonderful as my friend said, and in a nutshell is a sort of cross between \"Monsoon Wedding\" and \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\"<br />Jess, a Londoner of Asian descent, plays football in secret since her parents strictly forbid it and want her to grow into a nice, traditional Sikh girl who can cook a full Punjabi dinner. Jess, however, has other plans. She teams up with Jules (short for Juliet), a fellow footballer, and the team coach Joe and an American scout eagerly appraises the two. Along the way Jess has to survive her sister's frantic, bipolar engagement and wedding, come clean to her parents about her joining the team, fights over her blossoming romance, and learns to follow her heart. Jess confides her worries to her David Beckham poster that hangs over her bed. Her room is filled with Beckham memorabilia. Jules' mother is similarly against her daughter playing football, convinced that she must be a lesbian since she favours sports bras, has short hair and wears boyish clothes. The two girls hang out often, finding more similarities than differences, but when Jess nearly kisses Joe, Jules is furious, having eyed him for herself, and a stony rivalry ensues.<br />The film is doused with Indian culture, including saris, salwar kameez, samosas, Bollywood musicals, singing game shows, bhangra rock, and more, but always finds a more or less comfortable balance between Indian and London cultures. The unbelievably colourful, extravagant wedding was one of my favourite highlights of the film since I adore bhangra rock and Bollywood. The soundtrack is similarly influenced, with many Indian pop songs, and my favourite of all, \"The Power of Love\" cover (Sitam version) by Amar. The cinematography is at times used for comedic effect, as in rapid cutaways to see the dazed/shocked/delighted expression of parents and relatives, in dizzying, rapid-fire football matches, the colourful exuberance of the Indian wedding, the sizzling energy of a German nightclub, and at times timed shots to capture the beauty of day turning into dusk.<br />The movie is blessed with a strong cast, a great story, and characters that draw you into their worlds, worries, and triumphs, not to mention a catchy soundtrack, great football action, and a tender romance. \"Bend It Like Beckham\" will certainly join my other honoured favourites such as \"Monsoon Wedding\" and \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\" Oh, and look for a \"There's Something About Mary\"-like singalong/bloopers during the credits. If you love football, romantic comedies, and/or Indian culture, you will surely score with \"Bend It Like Beckham.\"",

The metal ring was very tight and hard to turn and eventually it just gave up and broke. The second one I ordered, which I am using now, the ring is very loose so it is useless to prop your phone up. The phone just falls flat when you try to use the ring.  The fact that it's a square and not round makes it a little harder to get it in a comfortable position to hold it with your finger.

You can rotate this ring but the mechanism is really stiff and there is only a small piece of plastic holding the ring to the side of the mechanism. It is definitely not adequate and if you rotate it a lot, it will break eventually which mine just did.

It has multiple adjustments for the legs.<br /><br />The remote is very simple and has two buttons. One for iOS and one for android.

However, I do like having the Apple one, too because there have been times when my daughter or a friend has needed one. I took it with me for a recent day of tailgating. I started charging my phone about half way through the day when my phone was at about 40% I found it to be a bit slow. It seemed like it would take a couple of minutes for my phone to go up 1%. After 45 minutes my phone had gone up to 68%. I'm used to faster charging. It wasn't terrible and I can definitely live with it. I used it a couple of more times for shorter periods of time on that same day. By the end of the day, the charger was down to 60% which seems like less than other chargers I've used.

This Symmetry case does work with it. It also works with wireless charging where the Defender case did not. It's thinner and easier to put on your phone and take it off. I feel that there's adequate protection, but definitely not as tough as the Defender. The color is cute, but with the logo grooves, I'm already seeing dirt in some of the letters.

    "text": "I have been wanting a real OtterBox phone case for years. I have been jealous of all my friends who have them, but I always get the cheap Android phones that never have OtterBox compatible cases. I've ordered some for my daughter who has an iPhone. Even my husband had one with a previous phone, but not me. Well, I just got a new phone (okay, a last year's model) this summer and guess what! There are OtterBox cases that are designed for it. I can't tell you how excited I was! After a few days of carefully holding my phone because it didn't have a case on it, my OtterBox arrived. I  opened the box and immediately started pulling off the plastic screen protector that was attached to the case. It was in there good and tight, but I eventually tore it away. Well, guess what? You're not supposed to remove that! I did read some other reviews and a message board and learned that some people do remove it, so I don't feel like a total loser, but still......  I ordered a screen protector separately, so it was still protected. Now back to the case. It was a little difficult to get it on the phone, but once I did, I don't think it's ever going to come off, at least until I want it to come off. It's a great looking case and I feel that it offers superb protection. There are just a few things I'm not crazy about. One,  I use a magnetic air vent phone holder for my car. The magnet slips in between the phone and the case. This case is too thick for the magnetic waves to hold it on the holder. I'm really disappointed about that. I could put a magnet on the outside of the phone case, but then the case won't look as good. Another thing that I am not fond of is that the audio output and the charging port both have covers on them. I understand the need to keep dust and such out, but it is annoying. I accidently didn't put my charging cable in all the way last night so my phone wasn't charged this morning. That cover piece had gotten in the way. Other than that, I'm happy with it. The case doesn't interfere with the volume controls. It is easy to grip. There is also an OtterBox Symmetry case available for my phone, so I may try that out to see if it takes care of my issues.",

I have had some car chargers that don't have any light, so if they wiggle out a bit to the point of not charging any more, I didn't know it. With this one, if the blue light is not on, then it's not charging. The speed of the charging is pretty good, too. It's definitely comparable to other car chargers regarding the speed. My husband and I did try the seat belt cutter on some cardboard and fabric scraps. It didn't cut in a smooth line, but it did saw through our materials eventually. The hammer feature was tested out on a block of wood. It left some dents in the wood.

Phones are securely held in the headset. Some of the earlier ones that I have tried did not make me feel that my phone was 100% safe!  This works for simple VR apps. It does not have any kind of trigger mechanism so you can control your phone once it is in the headset. So if you're playing a game or visiting a VR world, you can not access the menu that shows up on your screen. I've used some VR world apps where that's not necessary, but there are a lot of them that do utilize a menu. It comes with some foam sticky buttons that you are supposed to put on the pull out try where your phone goes and line them up with the phone's buttons, but even with that, there's still no way to trigger the menu.

    "text": "This hybrid phone case looks nice and seems like it is going to offer adequate protection to my Galaxy J7 phone. The fit is pretty good but  the rubber corners pull away easily and every once in a while I have to adjust it to so it is covering it well. The cut out holes are adequate and don't interfere with charging. The side power button is completely covered by the phone, but it is very easy to operate without any problems. The volume button on the other side is also completely covered, but it is a little difficult to use. It doesn't always work the first time. I've always been able to use it, but it sometimes takes a couple of tries. The bottom of the case has little grippy bumps so the phone doesn't slip out of your hands too easily. Overall, this is a good protective case for my phone.<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",

Especially after we spent $79 repairing her screen recently. So when I got my new phone, I thought maybe I should get a screen protector. My daughter likes the tempered glass protectors, so I thought I would go with that. This came with everything needed to ready my phone. The glass screen protector was very easy to put on my phone. The holes lined up correctly. I did a pretty good job of not getting bubbles, though I did get one bubble in the top corner, but fortunately for me it's not noticeable. I can live with that. I have been very pleased with this protector so far.<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",

    "text": "I had to get a new phone over the weekend and needed a phone case for it. I've had mixed experiences with hybrid phone cases before, so I wasn't sure what I would get with this one. The issue that I had in the past was that if you had to take the cover off, it was a 2-step process. You had to take off the hard case then the soft case or the other way around, I don't remember. Then when putting it back on, I could never get them perfectly back in place. I finally stopped trying and got a new one piece phone case. Well this case is basically one piece, so it's super easy to put on and take off. The edges around the screen are raised so extra protection is given to your phone. I have noticed that the button on the right side of the phone is a little more difficult to use since this case doesn't have a cut out there. Other than that, all of the other openings/buttons work just fine. I am beyond thrilled with this phone case!!! I thought I might have to keep looking, but I'm sticking with this one!!!",

This charger has two different outputs (Mom gets the faster one!). I haven't driven any long distances with this yet, but I have noticed that my phone battery is usually &quot;topped off&quot; by the time I get to work after my 10 minute commute. Usually, my charger doesn't fully finish charging my Nexus 5 during that time. There is a small light that comes on when it's charging. However, that light is difficult to see during the daytime. I didn't even know there was a light until I was driving at night one evening and I saw the blue glow. I do wish the light was easier to see during the day. Sometimes a charger may not be fully inserted to the plug and won't be charging.

Her case has gotten very worn and is barely holding together. Because she has an older phone, there aren't a lot of options for her as far as new phone cases go. She was practically in tears when I gave her this case. It fit her phone perfectly. She loved the magnetic feature which allowed her to easily remove her phone from the wallet. It's made from PU leather, but it looks classy and like real leather. I have purchased some PU leather items that look more like vinyl, but this looks good. And I felt good giving it to her whereas if it had looked cheap, I probably wouldn't have given it to her at all. The zipper on the wallet portion zipped okay. It wasn't a super smooth gliding zipper. The case doesn't interfere with the performance of the phone buttons or controls. My friend/co-worker is thrilled with this phone case and makes a point to show it to me almost daily and thank me.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

There is a flexible plastic/rubber case that fits directly on your phone. Then that case has magnets in it that keep it attached to the faux leather folder/wristlet. There is a magnetic clasp that keeps the folder closed. There are 2 card slots as well as a pocket to slide bills into. That's plenty of room for a teen. You wouldn't want to put much more in there due to thickness. The whole thing would not stay closed as well.  The magnets on the back of the separate phone case are pretty strong. She was able to stick her phone on the refrigerator and it did not slip or fall. There are not a lot of reasons that you would want to put your phone there, but if you do, then know that it's strong enough to hold it there. This wallet style phone case is perfect for my daughter to use. She doesn't usually carry a purse with her, but she always takes her phone with her. Now she can store her student ID and a little bit of cash with her easily.

    "text": "I work in a Special Ed middle school class. I took this Google Cardboard into class last week and those students absolutely loved it. First of all, it was easy to put together. My husband has purchased other Cardboards and the earlier models required more work to assemble. This one was super easy and I was able to do it all by myself. I downloaded a couple of VR apps from Google Play and let the students take turns with it. My favorite moment is when one of the autistic boys had his turn. He chose the Ocean VR one. After a moment of looking through it, he started singing &quot;Part of My World&quot; from Disney's The Little Mermaid. Many of the students in my class come from low income families. And none of them had ever used one of these before, let alone seen one. They were completely enthralled with it. After allowing all of the kids to take a turn, one of the velcro pieces was starting to come up, but that's an easy fix as far as I am concerned. And other than that, it held up very well. It's definitely a high quality, cardboard.  Another fun moment was when I shared it with the other classroom aid who is almost 60. She just as excited about it as the kids were! It is pretty amazing how far technology has progressed.<br /><br />*I received this for free for the purpose of trying it out &amp; reviewing. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",

I found that it didn't always react to my swipes from inside the case. The case is made out of a thick vinyl material. It comes with a strap so you can wear it around your neck.

There's about 1/2 an inch space at the top and less than 1/4 of an inch on the side when it's in the case. There's not so much extra space that it's sliding around. In fact it stays in place very well. With the smaller cases, he found that some of the buttons were obscured by the framing of the window. That's not the case with this one.

Over the years, I have learned that not all USB cables are created equally! First of all, the plastic the covers the ends of the cables is a solid material. We have had several cables that with use, bend or break in the place where the actual cable meets. Since this is all one piece on the ends, that's not going to happen. The cable is a good length. It's long enough that if it's plugged in a lower outlet, it can still reach the end table, but it's not too long that you have a lot of excess cable getting in the way. I love that it's available in a few different colors. I selected the lime green one so it's very easy to see which cable is mine! And if anyone walks away with it, I know which child has it! At first I had this in my car with a car charger. But over the last week, I never was in my car for more than 10 minutes at a time, so I couldn't get an accurate feel for whether or not it was a fast syncing cable. This morning I brought it inside and plugged into one of our charging stations. My phone was at 50% so I was curious to learn how quickly it would charge using this cable. Within 10 minutes my phone had charged  an additional 10%. When I checked thirty minutes later, it was fully charged. I was quite pleased with that. I have a Nexus 5 phone and depending on where I am charging it, it often takes longer than that.<br /><br />*I received the Haweel Micro USB cable for the purpose of trying it out & reviewing it. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",

The biggest difference between this one and the other mounts I have is the grip clip. I think that is so much easier to use. Both types require 2 hands, but in my opinion, the clip is more user friendly. We have 4 different Andriod phones in our household and they all fit well in the mount. So far we have not had any problems with it staying in place. I am very happy with my purchase.",

Every time we go out together, she gives me her cell phone to hold. Her phone/case are too bulky to fit comfortably in her pockets and she doesn't feel the need to carry a purse if I'm with her. Plus, many of her clothing items don't have pockets. Her phone fits nicely and securely in this. The bag itself is a nice, shiny silver faux patent material. The inside is bright, pink fabric. The chain is so much sturdier than I thought it would be and is comfortable worn across your body. The top of the bag does not close, but as long as you are wearing the bag, that's not an issue. We went to see a movie last night & my daughter wore her new Gracie bag! She was very happy with it. And so was I!",

Because of the thickness, it doesn't fit as easily into her pockets as her previous phone cover. The case is a mix of a hard case & rubber. The kickstand seems sturdy enough. It's going to be difficult to keep the white portion of the case white. We've already noticed a few scuffs, however, so far she's been able to wipe them off. It took 10 days from ordering for it to arrive, which is forever for a young teen!**UPDATE** I just changed my review from a 4 star to a 5 star. After a couple of months, I am very impressed with how it is doing. It still looks brand new. All the little jewels are still in tact, the kickstand is still secure and the white portion still is clean. I really didn't expect it to look this nice after heavy use by my teen.",
