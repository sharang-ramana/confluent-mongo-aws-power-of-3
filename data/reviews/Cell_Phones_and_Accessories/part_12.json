I actually stumbled onto MYBAT on Amazon and tried the purple cover with the white polka dots.  MYBAT has the same total coverage for the iphone, except you need to provide your own face glass shield if you want to.  IMO, using this type of complete coverage for the iphone really protects the power button at the top, the side buttons, and the push button at the bottom of the phone from dust and grease.  (People who don't use covers which protects these buttons frequently complain of these buttons getting stuck, and not working - it's due to the constant exposure to dust and lint from pockets, purses, brief cases, etc., and mostly oil and dirt particles from your hands.)  The Otterbox cover surely has it's place and will continue to serve me, but MYBAT is quite affordable, and will resolve my need to change out my phone cover intermittently, without breaking the bank and offering me more variety.",

Now i have mounted it on the windshield and its holding it well together, overall I say this is a great mount, easy to install and alot easier to use on the daily bases.",

This mount is as easy as it gets, the only problem I see is, if you have a nice case, the magnet will ruin it, but if you can live with that, I think these magnetic mounts are the way to go. Oh you also get two mounts in this box, can give the second one as a gift!",

Being that I have to download an app and it's not completely Bluetooth that connects directly to your phone. I was a little sketchy about that<br />2. The camera quality on the app sucks<br />3. The instructions to get your own camera running to use the face recognition part was kind of confusing but it does work<br /><br />If you're kind of tech savvy it will be a bit easier for you to get it up and running as there are quite a few steps.<br /><br />Finally Would I recommend yes",

Also, the embroidering could've been better.. a thread started to unravel on the outside of the case and the only way to prevent it from coming loose any further was to singe it slightly with a lighter.

(2) I would have liked another position closer to vertical.<br /><br />I highly recommend it if you're looking for a simple stand for your phone. For the price, it's well worth it.",

    "text": "Good idea, but underachieved in the end result.  I mostly compared this phone with my (now old) Samsung S4, and in comparison the P8 disappoints.  The S4 is a superior device in just about every way: better graphics, better software design (especially ease of use), better sound, etc.  For example, I found it frustratingly difficult to get the right zoom level for a photograph.  And after I took several pictures, I found it quite difficult to review all the pictures, and delete the ones I didn't want.  It would seem obvious to be able to delete (or do something else) to a picture that I'm viewing ... well, not the way Huawei designers thought about it.  All the controls and options seem just a tad less smooth than you'd want in a good smartphone.<br /><br />For sound and visuals, the best way I can put it is that the P8 sounds a bit tinny and sort of looks it, too (if you can mentally translate the idea of tinny to visuals).  If you check the published specs and/or read published reviews, you'll see the detailed differences, so I won't bother to repeat them here.  Suffice it to say that 720x1280 just isn't good enough for a phone priced in this range.<br /><br />All the usual Google/Android apps work as expected, I didn't see anything particularly different about them, although I found the phone's responsiveness to touch and swipe and long-press less than ideal.  I've used both Samsung and Apple devices recently, and there's a reason why those two brands are so popular.<br /><br />That said, it's not a bad phone, and a perfectly reasonable option as your unlocked phone for international travel, for instance.  (So that you can buy a prepaid chip locally and use a phone without paying ridiculous roaming charges.)  But before you buy this one, check for alternatives, there are a few others worth considering (such as a Nokia Lumia, a Moto E, or even an Amazon Fire Phone perhaps).",

At the same time, it's large compared to my BlueAnt Z9, seems similar to the old Plantronics Voyager.  If you like a headset that goes over the ear and feels like it will just stay there, while being quite comfortable, then this one is definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Pairing with an Android phone was very easy, took less than 10 seconds (I think) after glancing through the easy start guide.  The sound quality is excellent, even in a somewhat noisy environment -- apparently the noise cancellation does work quite well.<br /><br />The controls are easy to use: fortunately, they didn't go with the \"one button for everything\" that sounds clever but is impossible to use.  There are separate buttons, well placed, for controlling power, volume, and call answer/disconnect.  There is one multi-function button (under the boom) that is a mute button during a call, for streaming music pause/play, or for some voice action (speech recognition) commands at other times.  If your phone supports it, you can also use the call control button to initiate voice dialing.<br /><br />Another cool feature is call announcement: an incoming call is announced, with caller name (if supported by your phone), and you can say \"answer\" or \"ignore\".  Or you can hit the call button if you're not the chatty type.<br /><br />I also liked the charger: there is a magnetic coupling between the charging end of the headset and the charger, so they fit together securely.  Nice thoughtful design there.  Note however that the charging cable is very very short, just about 3 inches long.  Go figure.<br /><br />If you want to find out more about the features & usage & customization, you can go to these links for PDF docs on the Plantronics website:<br />[...]<br />[...]",

The belt loop is relatively slim (compared to some I've seen), and is comfortable to wear.  It doesn't have a super-strong clip, so there is a slight risk of the case getting pulled off if it's caught on something (e.g., when you're getting in & out of your car).<br /><br />The case is well-made, with a simple & solid construction.

However, excellent reviews in Cnet & other places, description of the features, and the limited choices of such products convinced me to give it a try.<br /><br />So far I'm quite delighted, it has exceeded my expectations considerably.  (I'd probably give it 4+ stars to be cautious, but I'm being generous, and will downgrade if experience justifies).<br /><br />Firstly, the pairing was easy, once I figured out that my Samsung Renown (Verizon) didn't pair correctly if you had \"Auto Pair\" set.  (Don't know who thought of that dumb feature.)  And I was puzzled about the failure to download the phone book, until I read the Supertooth3 manual more carefully.<br /><br />After that, everything worked smoothly, with no trouble.  The sound is quite good, and the voice prompts and announcements are clear and concise.  (I kept it on British English, since I liked that better than the US English.)  All buttons are easily used, and conveniently placed.<br /><br />Voice dialing through my phone worked reliably, consistently, and easily.  Make sure you speak loudly and clearly, of course.<br /><br />I love the readout of the caller-id, which is surprisingly fast, and very clear.  Obviously a very useful feature when you're driving.<br /><br />I also found the automatic re-connect feature very useful, and it does really work.  (You leave your car to go into a store or something, the ST3 disconnects.  When you get back in your car, the ST3 reconnects, and tells you politely that it did so.)  The only thing I had to deal with was the manual disconnect at home, since the car in the garage is close enough that the ST3 won't disconnect until I move far enough away.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a bluetooth speakerphone for your car, this is a fine choice, and probably the best one out there.",

You have to get your phone out and disconnect the device from the bluetooth menu, then recycle the power on the device, then you can proceed again.

    "text": "Just got the Sidekick II and spent literally an hour with tech support trying to get around a bug. They said nobody before had asked them that question. I call a lot overseas and, surely, don't dial directly due to the cost. I use a calling card, a pin and then the number. Even the oldest cell phones have a much longer field length on the phone number, so that you can program the calling card (10 digits), the pin (10 digits) and a foreign number (12+ digits). The Sidekick II stops on the 28th digit! What an annoyance. I found, however, that if I use the speed dial function, the field length is not restricted. With only 9 speed dials, though, this is not much help.<br /><br />Another bug is that if you do a select-copy-paste on a phone, and copy the number to another speed dial (so I don;t have to type the calling card for every entry), it pastes the whole seeting, including the name and then doesn't let you change it.<br /><br />A third bug is that the phone does not allow you to save a draft of a text message. If you are not able to send a message (system outage etc), you can't just save the message to send later, but you have to retype it.<br /><br />Looks like the Sidekick II does not allow any change in color, plates or walpaper either.<br /><br />I like the phone - it's fun and very intuitive, but at this time I am pondering whether to return it and stick with my Nokia 3650 which gives me all of the same, just without the bugs. I activated a new account with TMobile, but I have little hope they'll let me carry over my old number. My plan was just to cancel the old service..but I may give it a try if I keep the phone.<br /><br />I wish these engineers didn't sleep on the job and stopped these annoying bugs from happening. After all, how hard is it to set a longer text field, if you are setting it on the speed dial anyway..<br /><br />Oh...did I say the phone also doesn't allow you to add a memory card?<br /><br />Good toy, though...I am nervous about putting work data on it, keeping in mind TMobile has access to it.

It is the best I have ever bought over the past several years. And my eyes do seem less strained. Great screen protector!",

    "text": "I love this cord for its length as it lets me use my iPad 2 without any real regard for how far away the outlet is.  I must say that the first cord worked wonderfully for about a month and then all of a sudden was not making a good enough connection to charge the device.  It seemed to be an issue with the angle the cord was connecting with the device.  Super customer service though--prepaid shipping to send the defective cord back and the new one arrived shortly thereafter.  I will update if the same problem arises, but I do not expect trouble.  Again great customer service and replacement under the one year warranty/",

My only concern was the description made it difficult to see that it does not have full screen protection, because the info is buried further down in description.  It does have raised beveled edges but no actual screen orotector, you will have to buy it separately which is not what I wanted. My previous iPhone was a 5S and the case was a real tree pink cami Otterbox. The Otterbox no longer makes the pink cami for iPhone 11 my new phone so I was looking for the same type of protection with built in screen protection that my Otterbox had but also wanted a pattern to the case. Since Otterbox only had plain black in case type I wanted I chose to look elsewhere.  I will use this case till I find one that is like What I want. Price is great for what you do get, a study face edge, a silicone center and hard sturdy back.",

I had to reserve to cutting the silicon material on the bottom of the case to make it larger and uncover the microphones. Other than that I like this case, its kinda heavier than Im used to but thats not a biggie.

That gave me some time to reflect on the fact that I just needed more room and I /really/ didn't mind switching carriers for a locked phone deal and a sparkly new compatible sim.<br /><br />I'm happy with my decision because I tend to leave lots of apps running and have lots of tabs in chrome, and even brand new, the 6a had a little trouble managing that. In particular, the developer options section in settings would lag and freeze, even when I was just scrolling through and had closed most other apps.<br /><br />If you put your phone through a lot, consider going with the 7 or better for the processing capabilities. The only thing I preferred about the 6a was the slightly smaller size; I have smallish hands and it fit them better.<br /><br />Also... if you're trying to decide whether to move your physical sim from your old phone or to download an e-sim, you should probably just go the e-sim route. Once I had a new sim (my new carrier sent me a physical one, so I just used that despite my younger sister's disdainful laugh at the thought), the Pixel 7 handled phone calls perfectly.",

The big test was would it hold my Asus Chromebook - 12\"x 8.25\" and weighs 11.75lbs? At its lowest height setting, the stand was sturdy and safely held the Chromebook, at an angle. The weight did not cause the stand to slide down or sink. I was quite impressed.<br />I like the stand. Think I might buy another one for myself as my wife seems to have appropriated this one.",

I may get a case with a magnetic detachable phone cover so that I can use my phone easily without the wallet if desired, and use it on a magnetic car mount without the wallet as well.<br /><br />Only minor negatives, it feels pretty stiff to be able to fold backward and stand up. Because of the stiffness, I am not sure how the leather would wear repeatedly doing that. The magnet on the front clasp has a little divet - and it has to be perfectly aligned to stay clasped... while it doesn't really snap, it does have to be in the hole, to stay \"magneted\" closed, so it takes a little more attention to detail to close.<br /><br />Overall if you are looking for leather wallet iPhone case in this price range, it is a great choice.",

This time, it said \"In\" so we left it to go. That was at about 10am.  It is now EIGHT HOURS LATER and it has only climbed up 22%.  In EIGHT HOURS.  So I read the small details.  It recommends a block with 5v/2a or 5v/2,4A power.  I checked mine.  It is 5v/.3 which is waay too weak for this (but works great with our phones).  I checked another block here, it is 5v./1.55  I checked another.  It is 5v/1a.  So not one single block in our home is the recommended size for optimal charging.

At first I was worried that having this case would cause issues with using Samsung Pay because of the metal peice that allows for magnetic car mounts, but I was pleasantly relieved when it still worked (I literally don't use my physical cards anymore so this would have been a major bummer for me but overall not a deterrent). Plus I now purchased a magnetic car mount and now I love this case even more! Also, wireless charging still kind of works. There are a few things though that keep this from being a perfect 5 for me.<br /><br />1- The cut out around the fingerprint sensor is small and has resulted in frequent misreads, which prompts me to key my pin in often (1st world problems, right? Lol)<br />2- The cut out on the back is also a downer for camera use. I can't easily wipe the lens of the camera when necessary and I always end up having to remove the case in order to clean it. I don't take a ton of photos, but I do take enough for this to be a nuisance.<br />3- When it comes to aesthetics, then I wish they would have opted to not paint the ring. It looks really great when you get it, but the paint eventually chips off easily and that makes it look ugly. I'm not rough with it, but I do set it down on tables often and I assume all the chipped paint is because of that. Other reviewers mentioned this too so at least I was prepared for it.<br />4- Finally there are some issues with wireless charging because of the ring. I have a Samsung wireless charger that I keep at work and it still works  perfectly well with this case. However, at home I have an alarm clock on my nightstand with built in wireless charging but unfortunately this case isn't compatible with it, so at home I have to plug in. (Another 1st world problem, lol)<br /><br />Overall the pros outweigh the cons and the price is fair in my opinion. I feel confident that if I ever need to replace my case in the future, then I will most likely repurchase this case.<br /><br />I hope that helped (^_^)",

It worked fine when I got it, no issues at all as far as I remember. Now I'm no artist, but I thought I would have fun doodling with it, turns out pen and paper just feel better for me. After using it for a week or two I learned drawing on a computer wasn't what I thought it would be and stored the pen back in its box in my closet. The thing laid dormant and untouched in there until recently, in January 2020. I started studying again and thought the thing would work fine to take notes with at least. The tip and barrel buttons still work fine, but the bluetooth module on the back won't turn on at all. At first I thought it was that maybe the batteries had died and I spent $10 buying replacements (I stupidly bought the AAAA first because I thought it was the only battery, but realized only after replacing it that I needed the tiny SR527SW for the bluetooth module). Unfortunately replacing the batteries didn't work. The writing still works fine, but I wanted the bluetooth to work too so I could easily tap the back button to toggle between my note taking app and my online webinar app. If I had kept using it when I got it then I'm  sure I would have been able to replace when it decided to stop working. I'm not sure what the problem is, but I'm pretty sure some component got loose because the light won't turn on and I can hear a  I can hear a faint rattle. What upsets me the most is that I spent $10 on batteries I can't return and I don't have any other devices that use them. I feel confident I could probably fix the bluetooth module myself but I have no idea how to get to it without destroying the pen to get into it. Unfortunately it looks like no one else on the internet has taken it apart successfully to give me a guide either so I'm plum out of luck. For now I'm settling for using a partially functional pen, but for the price I expected it to have an operating life longer than the 50 hrs I actually used it for (and that's probably a generous estimate).",

The only thing I feel I should mention is that when you use a solid black watch face, the rim does this sort of rainbow effect that reflects a faint greenish color. It's very minor and faint, but I know some people can be picky about that kind of stuff so I thought I would mention it. If a more colorful watch face is used the effect is unnoticeable.",

The buttons are easy to find and push, and the installation is a breeze. The phone just snaps into place. The front of the case barely sits over the front of the phone, I would have liked to see a higher/thicker front part of the case to save my phone from belly flops, but overall it is still ok. The stand on the back is just plastic and probably not the most resilient, but it still does a great job of being a stand. Given the limited kickstand cases avialable for the Note 8 that offer portrait and landscape viewing, I'm totally satisfied with this case.",

There's a wrist strap to help you carry it, and the 'Anthracite' leather crackle is an interesting finish with the silver/black if a bit rough and perhaps not the longest wearing finish, either.

This case snaps on (and off) without too much of a hassle, and for the most part there isn't too much of a difficulty using the power or volume buttons (nails help with the mute button). I'm not too terribly hard on my phones (and having typed that, will live in dread of Murphy's Law), so the occasional drop and such has stood up well to this case, and I like the rubber feature along the sides to help keep the case from sliding. Not a big fan of the 'Apple window' - don't much see the point of it, and wish this was a pure solid case - if I was buying a case I'd go for one without the hole.<br /><br />Still, for the price I think you're getting a lot of value here.

    "text": "I bought this product for my new Samsung S6 and I absolutely LOVE this wireless charger!  :)<br /><br />Usually, if something you pay for is cheaper than the original or something that is high quality (in this case, the Samsung wireless charger that costs $50), &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Well, I am happy to say that is not the case. I really did take a chance on this product, and I am glad I did. I love how it is secure (non-slip whenever my phone is on it, unless you try to tilt it off enough, of course--then it will--because it is supposed to lay flat), how balanced the wireless charger is when it is a on flat surfaces, how it is non-slip on the bottom as well, it's lightweight for travel, and how it lights up & lets me know when it is on (RED), charging (BLUE pulsating) and done charging my phone (GREEN). Qi in Chinese means &#34;light force&#34; or &#34;energy flow&#34;, so this product in real essence is of Qi, in terms of your phone. It really makes you feel like your phone is a living, breathing thing. Our phones are literally our lives after all, in this day and age.<br /><br />Now, some people that reviewed this product on Amazon addressed some downsides: that this does not come with a USB wall adapter, that the wireless charger does not charge your phone fast enough and that it is lid up too much & bothers their eyes, especially while they try to sleep at night--Although it may NOT come with a USB wall adapter to keep this product on, it DOES come with a USB cord, in which you can connect with your regular Samsung USB wall adapter or a spare USB you have around. I think any wall adapter will work with this, as long as you have and can connect with a USB cord. I personally feel that the USB cord that this device comes with is a bit short from my nightstand so I just use my Samsung USB cord as well for extension. As for the charging, it does take a considerable amount of time to charge (about 2 hours or so, depending if you are the type that lets your phone go as close to 10% dying or charges it after 50% of battery life is lost) but that is still fast than perhaps other wireless chargers. Remember that most of the wireless chargers I browsed through here don't even light up at all like this one does. So consider the &#34;slow&#34; charging as an overstatement. It charges well enough. Still, if you have a busy lifestyle and use your phone from 9-5 like how your work schedule may be, this wireless charger is best used when you wind down for the night or you're better off using the traditional method.<br /><br />The ONLY THING why I took a star off for is when it is supposedly done charging or when it immediately turned green when the very FIRST TIME I tested/used it, my phone was at 95%. It still charges but my point is that sometimes, it can make you believe it's fully charged when it may not be. It did also initially heat up my phone when beginner use but this has improved overtime and it works with a case on. Not so sure for metal phone cases. I wouldn't advise use of this product if you do because it will heat up your phone in the beginning (not sure why). But it is SAFE to use, and I love how it also serves as a nightlight for me, haha. Lights don't bother my eyes at night. But if you are the type of person that is sensitive to these kind of things, then this is also not the product for you. Take a chance on other brands but this is the best one for the value, price and convenience.<br /><br />All and all, I am a happy customer! :)",

It doesn't seem to always work correctly though.<br /> I have to admit that the service is not good at all.<br />It is sent to my landlords house, not mine! I've talked to people over and over. They keep telling me they'll help but things are still being sent to my landlords house and not mine.<br />I have to carry almost every product around to my door! Which may not be hard for some but is hard for me.<br />I am grateful to those who pay attention to my instructions and thank them for being humane.<br />I ask the others to pay attention to my instructions and will not give a 5 review until my instuctions are followed.

The wood feels great in the hand. I love that it comes from a renewable source and I've gotten several compliments about the cool case<br />Craftmanship: It really is amazing that you can make a case from wood. There are so many little touches, like the beveling around the volume control that makes you appreciate the product.<br />- Price: I looked at a lot of cases and I think the cost is very reasonable.<br /><br />Disadavantages<br />-The edges are a little bit thicker, it is by no means a slim case, but no where big as an otter box. It takes a little while to get used to the thicker edges, I found I had to re-train my hand to turn the power button on/off, but now it is no big deal at all. Also, the thicker bottom side doesn't allow for using the 30 pin to lightening connection without taking the bottom part of the case off.<br />- In regards to that, I found after putting the case together, I'm now not able to take it apart. The two parts have fit together so snugly that I really don't think I'll be able to take it apart without breaking the case.<br />- As another reviewer pointed out, I'm not sure how protective it is. I'm sure it would protect from at least 1 drop from waist height onto a hard surface (oddly I haven't dropped mine yet)<br />- I have noticed a partial break already in the front of the case. I've also stopped putting my keys in the same pocket of the phone, because the wood can scratch.<br /><br />Overall<br />- Despite it's limitations I really enjoy this case. Feels great in the hand, plenty of compliments. You do have to put up with some drawbacks, but I think they are well worth it.",

Would not purchase again.",

It has a grid on the inside of it perhaps for protection?? But to me it makes it hard to really read my Fitbit and I have to re tap it a few times to get my results. When it says it's clear I expected it to be clear. 2. Even though its rubber it's already got scratches on it, but better than having the scratches on my actual screen. 3. It's hard to press the button on the side with the way the opening fits over it. And it's kind of hard to slide over the Fitbit without getting smudges on the surfaces.<br />I love the idea of the product but expected a better result.",

The case itself does not cover the areas shown in the photos so more of the phone is left exposed to potential damage.<br />The graphic image on the backside is off-center and ends up making the whole image look tacky. This was not a screen print as other reviews have mentioned, the “Ideal of Sweden” is on a small gold-plated frame inset into the plastic design and looks nice. The colors are bright and the pattern is very pretty if you don't mind it being crooked.<br />The microfiber lining also does extend the length of the case as indicated in the photo.",

It does not seem compatible with various proprietary fast charging standards, but it also doesn't charge things slowly, it puts out plenty of power to top off devices even during use.<br /><br />It feels very sold - it has some heft in the hand, the materials are dense and smooth, there is a pleasing matte finish to it. I'd like it to seat a bit better/more tightly in the cigarette lighter socket, but that may be the socket and not the charger.<br /><br />My major complaint is that the power on this unit is not isolated, which means it is capable of creating a ground loop with analog audio devices, thus putting out a hum. This is disappointed for a device of this kind, even if analog audio is considerably more rare these days than it used to be. I have a much less expensive USB DC-DC buck converter which I tied in elsewhere in the car, and that does not have any such issue. Indeed this is how I know the noise is from the Anker - the exact same setup on the buck converter, which is connected to the same socket, has no issue were as the Anker has noise where ever it is connected. This necessitates the use of an isolator somewhere else in my setup.<br /><br />If you don't care about the noise, then there's no problem, this is a good car charger. If noise is a potential problem, I'd look elsewhere or prepare to do your own isolation.",

It is just soft enough to offer some grip, but not so soft that its liable to sustain damage from daily activities.<br /><br />If you live a rougher life, or are more careless with your phone, then this probably will not offer the protection you need - for that you'd want a full shell. However, if you aren't too active, or at least only bring your phone into relatively controlled environments like regular shopping, the office, the classroom, ect. this would probably work for you.<br /><br />EDIT: I bought a magnetic mount for my car (SCOSCHE MPVB) and attached the metal plate to the inside of the case. It holds just fine. So this is thin enough to use with such a mount without needing to attach the plate to the outside.",

    "text": "I purchased these for my brand new Moto X4, along with a case. This model of phone isn't all that pricey, but I'd like to keep it in good shape anyway.<br /><br />Installation was very easy - the rigidity of the protector makes it easy to install without bubbles of any kind. Just put the phone down in a clean, well-lit environment, wipe it down with the included alcohol pads, clean it off with the included microfiber cloth, line up the top or bottom edge and lay the protector down on the screen. Very simple.<br /><br />The protector is oleophobic; this means that while it does accumulate fingerprints and such, it cleans off very easily. For example, I keep the protector in my suit jacket pocket, and its screen always comes out clean, no fingerprints at all. It is smooth and feels almost frictionless when using it with clean hands.<br /><br />Visually, there is very little difference from the OEM screen, though this does have a fine but still visible grid of little dots. They don't bother me in the slightest, but I only use my phone for calls, texts, and checking email, and eschew all media-related activities. As such, it isn't a bother.<br /><br />Durability-wise - well, I installed the protector and damaged it within a week, though the circumstances were pretty unique. The phone slid off the top of a jar and fell about a foot and a half and happened to catch the lip of a second jar on the way down. The impact point was exactly at the thinnest part of the protector, right below the aperture of the fingerprint scanner pad. This smashed, so that it is now whitish, but retained its form. There is a hairline crack that extends to the left across the bottom corner of the screen, but it is barely visible except in the proper light. I've kept the original protector on the phone and have had no further issues. No scratches either, though I'm pretty careful with it and so it rarely is in a position where it would be in contact with a significant abrasive.<br /><br />Not bad. Maybe if I bought another, I'd get a thicker one, just to be sure, but I'm pretty happy with what I have here to be honest. Would recommend.",

This is a much larger battery for additional charging time<br /><br />We use these for our trips to places like Disney works. You need your phone to use the app all day so that drains battery.  Plus your screen brightness is always high and you've got the internal fan going. It's hard on a phone<br /><br />So I got this and think it's good.  Easy to use and I like the general design of it.

It's a white cone pyramid shape.  This is what you want to setup outside and point towards a cell tower.<br /><br />Second is the inside receiver unit. It's the black square box.  This gets setup and connects the outdoor antenna to the indoor.<br /><br />That's the third part.  White circle. Indoor antenna.  This is what completes the cycle to boost your cell phone signal.<br /><br />The listing says that the major carriers have all provided blanket consent for these boosters but you also have to register it with the company.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:11ccac015eb219ef3054798372c387c5]] I've been a long time user of cell phones and smart phones - since 2003 for cell phones and 2009 for smart phones.  I've had droids, iPhones, you name it. This is probably the sturdiest phone I've owned.  This thing feels like a tank can run it over and it'll be fine.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about this at first but the initial reviews I read were accurate.  This is a solid android phone.<br /><br />I used it primarily on wifi and it's fine.  I've got the Orbi setup at home and this did fine.<br /><br />A few things really stand out:<br />1. The flashlight is the most obvious.  Four big LEDs in the back.  I need it at night when walking dogs and this was a real positive feature for me.<br />2. Fingerprint recognition is great. I miss it.  Wearing a mask all the time makes facial recognition tough but finger print is back and great !<br />3. It's a tank.  Remember the old Nokia phones you couldn't break?  This is just like that.<br /><br />Fun fact - this has a headphone jack.  I can use my old headphones again!<br /><br />Battery life seems good.  About what you'd expect.  It's got a forehead measurement feature which seems cool. I guess it's a good thing in today's world.<br /><br />Storage and adding an extra SIM card seem really nice too.  Haven't done it yet but I see myself in the future using it.",

    "text": "This cover is really robust and fits the phone very well.  It's also very thick and quite bulky.  It came on my work phone and it apparently comes with a guarantee that if anything happens to the phone otterbox will replace the phone.  I actually treat my phone pretty roughly just because I have this cover on it.  Unfortunately it makes your phone enormous and apparently the screen protector is not good as the IT guys rip it out before they gave us the phone.  Most of my colleagues have taken off the otterbox as it really destroys the coolness of the phone.  Maybe just because they are mostly self conscious sales guys.  If you want a case that will offer the most possible pretection for your phone that fits well this is it.",

Much better protection than the plastic back covers that snap over the side.  Also comes with scratch resistant film for the face which has been surprisingly effective.<br /><br />1 year later...<br />The bumper is 2 piece rubber and plastic, the rubber used is pretty tacky and tended to keep it from sliding easily into my pocket.  Also it was pretty thin and ended up tearing though the bumper was still useable.  The holes for the ear phones and charger did not always accomodate the accessories that I wanted to use.  There are better cheaper bumpers out there.",

I should say, I am not a Selfie person, either and I am not wearing make-up for a camera lens only, either. I wear pretty minimal.

It fits my phone perfectly and wraps around the edges of the screen to protect the glass. The only downside has been lint connecting on the case when I put in in my pocket but the fibers are easy to remove with a damp cloth.",

    "text": "I bought this for my friend who recently had surgery.  I'm speaking from experience here and although flowers are nice, it's better to receive a get well soon present that is useful.  This is great for bedrest.  There's a compartment for your snacks that also has a lid.  There's also a wireless phone charger that allows you to charge your phone while still being able to use it.  If you lift up the charger or the snack compartment you can hide stuff like medicine or candy inside it.  The best part is the cup holder.  I'm not really sure how it works,  but it self balances.  You can try it knock it over and it just wiggles around.  This is especially helpful for her because she is still heavily medicated and her hands aren't very steady.",
