The fold-out stand is great for hands free movie watching.<br />The case itself protects well from bumps and bruises. I have dropped by phone onto a bare tile floor at work several times and it looks no worse for the wear. Excllent protection.<br />It has elevated edges around the screen. This helps to protect the screen from direct contact when face down. Unfortunately, these raised edges make it a little difficult to pull down the notification drawer when in landscape mode. Not a huge deal; just push some of the flexible silicone out of the way before you swipe down. I'd rather have the protection than have a bare screen, though.<br />The case also comes with a belt holster with a nice fabric spot facing your screen. The clip on the holster also turns into a stand. It seemed a bit odd at first because this only allows you to face the back towards you. After a few moments, I realized that this allowed me to aim the rear speaker directly at me while placing the phone on a desk or counter.<br />Protection and added features in the same package. Defintely consider this case if you own an S4 Active.",

Instead of those squishy rubber tips that don't glide across the screen very well, this nib is made out of some kind of conductive \"micro-knit\" material. It's still got some give like the rubber nibs, but it slides across the screen as smoothly as if it were made out of silk. It's worked without a hitch on every device I've tried it on from my phone to my tablet; even the touch screen monitor at work.<br /><br />Build quality and size are good too. Not too heavy and not too light either. I believe that the entire body is made out of metal, so it should hold up to some significant abuse.<br /><br />Overall, it's 100% recommended.",

Overall it's great but the only two downsides I have found are that there is a little touch loss in the very center of the Watch that wasn't there before installing the screen protector. The second downside is that the black edge that is curved that allows for such great fit and alignment when perfectly centered on the product still from some angles obscures the view of the edges of the screen. It is hard to capture on camera. The benefits are that it feels nice to use. That it goes on easy and that it feels as if it will protect nicely from scratches. It also Fits well with a case on the watch. For the two downsides especially since it affects touch sensitivity I cannot give this product a  5-Star but I think it's a pretty Satisfactory 4-Star product and would recommend the product to friends with those two caveats.<br /><br />* In one of my pictures you will see the contents of the box minus the one set of clean wipes and one screen protector I used on my watch.",

Suggestion to help the protector dry, and seal and help relieve some air bubbles use a hair drier alternating between the cool and slightly warm settings (don't use extreme heat, could be bad for device and skin), if in doubt use cool setting. Also in place of a hair dryer you can also use a McDonald's hand dryer (speaking from experience). Hair dryers are helpful if you are having problems getting the little edges to stick.",

Fingerprint sensor is functional (I contacted them about a defect in the original product in the fingerprint sensor cover I had and they sent me a new case that appears to be defect free. They were easy to work with.)<br />2. Slim, similar to Lifeproof. Good for if you drop your phone.<br />3. The metal plate on back gives it some weight and balance.<br />4. Volume and power buttons function as they are supposed to function.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Port covers,  seem to be weak points especially at the hinges.<br />2. Extremely difficult to open once phone is in<br />3. Vibrate/silence switch cover, same weakness as the port covers.<br /><br />This case is good quality for the price of $12.99 (since this post was originally the price has risen to $17.99; still a descent value at that price at about a quarter of the price of Lifeproof). It provides great protection for the iPhone 6.<br /><br />Tips: 1. Don't forget to remove the plastic on the inside front panel. It hides in there and will cause you issues such as touch screen malfunction and fingerprint sensor malfunction.<br />2.

It's not like a rubber it's a different kind of material it's hard to explain it has a good texture feeling in your hand and I can hold my phone with one hand and text and not have to worry about my phone sliding out of my hand. As a nice tight firm solid feeling it's not flimsy corners don't pop off but at the same time it's easy to remove if you need to. Spigen always makes quality products not too thick I do not do the cases slim and sleek fingerprint reader is cut out perfectly along with the camera microphone button etc. Has a nice look to it I'd suggest it. can't say how much protection is going to provide the front of your screen upon dropping it. But in the stay of life you needed to go for hardcore protection or you go for sleek and style. You're looking at this case you're obviously looking for sleek and style. I don't have no doubt that it would protect the sides and back perfectly. Does have a small lift so you can set your phone down on a countertop with no worries.",

The endges kinda have a curve so your hands rest nicely around the phone. It's nice and tight like a glove. So no cornor pooping in your pocket 😉 some people say it has a plastic feel..I personally think it has more of a \"HARD\" rubber feel. I like it alot. Buttons are nice and clicky. All ports are open very nicely good cutouts. Has a small lift for when the phone is flat down. Good job Spigen. Y'all never let me down. I have 3 cases for my note 9 and at the end of the day Spigen always takes the win as my daily driver :)",

    "text": "This is the second glass screen protector I have used for my phone. I'm really impressed with glass screen protectors and don't think I will ever switch back traditional screen protectors. What I like about the screen protector more than the one that I was using previously is that it has a cut out over where the front facing camera is. I think this allows for clear pictures when using the front camera also offering sufficient protection for the phone screen. What I wasn't really impressed with with the screen protector was the alcohol pad – though sealed – was dried out upon arrival. The tablet is supposed to be used to remove the backing on the glass protector ripped off without removing the backing. The sticky dust remover was also a pain to take part and use because it was sealed firmly to the backing.  I'm fairly certain that this particular package had been stored for a significant period of time before being shipped because I've never had these problems with any other screen protectors. The screen protector itself was in good condition and with the use of a fingernail I was able to get the backing off without the tab. It went on easily to the screen with no air bubbles or other issues. It is firmly attached and offers great protection to the screen while not affecting screen sensitivity or usability of the phone. Overall I will give this four stars because I don't feel that my experience with the accessories included in this is typical and because the screen protector itself still works very well.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.

It's extremely slow and laggy with even basic tasks like shopping on Amazon. The battery life was good, but did not reach the advertised 2 days. But the kicker was that this phone does not have NFC, so there is no tap-to-pay feature. I did a little research and found a Samsung Galaxy A32 that is much faster, has tap-to-pay, and is an all-around upgrade to this phone. It was $35 more, but well worth it.

What's the point in getting a fun colored phone if you're just hiding it with a case all the time.<br />-Bumpers! A lot of cases say they are &#34;drop proof&#34; but the bumpers on this are heavy duty! The corners are well padded which having a toddler who likes to throw phones, this is great!<br />-Cost- great low price for a case. Better than paying $50+ for a case from a brick and mortar retailer.<br /><br />Things I wasn't wild about:<br />-Black piping around the camera lense on the back on the case. The whole thing is clear except this. A little weird.<br />-The cord attachment. It's very practical and works well it just isn't really fashionable and then you have this cord hanging off your phone.<br />-Thickness- it is slimmer than an Otterbox but it was still pretty bulky compared to other cases I have.<br /><br />All in all it has held up very well and I'm happy with how protected my phone feels.<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for my unbias review and honest opinion*",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:a5f0e0a361cb3aab7c01e41a587b25b]] I purchased this case after being let down with another one I got from a different brand that was fantastic except for their “anti yellow” promise that fell through within only a couple months. I've seen this case pop up a few times in my searching and finally decided to just go for it based on the positive reviews. I saw one guy go very in depth about what he likes in a case and how he spends a lot of time looking- honestly mood, finally someone gets it. I definitely agree with almost everything he says about this case except for one thing which is the tactile (or ‘click-y as I say) feel of the buttons. For my case, the home button is pretty responsive and doesn't take a lot of pressure to push. However, the volume buttons definitely take effort which honestly isn't THAT devastating since I typically pull down on the screen if I wanna adjust my volume for whatever I'm listening to. So meh, didn't take away a star for that because I figure that's just me nitpicking.<br /><br />Moving on! I chose pink which is extremely out of character for me but I'm so happy I did. I was worried it'd be a silly shade that didn't suit me, but it's a beautiful soft pastel pink that feels more neutral than anything.<br /><br />The materials this case is made of feels very high end and I'm here for it. When I say it feels durable, I mean it. It's not flimsy or floppy, it has shape to it and a certain hardness that feels assuring. Quick shoutout to the precise cutouts and the raised camera lip!<br /><br />Onto my favorite part- the thin and minimalist features which are to swoon over. There is no annoying branding, the case isn't chunky by any means, and it's just so simple that you'll be constantly staring and wondering how this product doesn't have more sales. Like seriously, I'm so minimalist when it comes to my phone that I don't have a single icon/app showing unless you look at the bottom main row. This case completes that vibe of a clean, breathable feel and it's appreciated.<br /><br />The bumpers, another nice feature, seem like they'll actually do some protecting. I'm elated they don't protrude which I was afraid of- they actually sit nearly flush (aligned) with the rest of the case. Lastly, the free stand is not only -super- functional, but it feels surprisingly high quality considering it's a freebie. I don't think I'm gonna use it a lot but I'm always gonna have it with me in case someone is in need of one. But man, it's the little stuff like that which brings the whole thing full circle to being a wonderful purchase.<br /><br />Overall, I'm so freaking excited and happy with this case. I wish I could get free ones like some people have (nudge nudge to the company) but regardless I'm happy to buy more in different colors assuming this current one holds up and keeps me satisfied. My next color will either be the light green or alpine green, but I hope one day to own all colors. I'm really rooting for more to come out too, such as possibly maroon, lilac, a milk tea color (very soft shade of light brown), yellow, maybe some neons, etc.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm in love with what I got. My boyfriend is even constantly reminding me of how nice it is! He is due for a new case and judging by how much he looks at mine, it's safe to say a purchase from him is coming soon as well. Thank you to this company for making a gorgeous product. I obsess over finding the perfect case which usually leads to frustration and a head ache, but buying this spontaneously has been one of my favorite decisions I've made in a hot minute. By the way, I LOVE how you can still see the Apple logo through the back. Another thing to note- this case does have grip to it.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone who tends to get obsessive as well, I know how horrifyingly tedious it can be to search for a hundred hours just to not find anything or be let down. Give this case a try if you're looking for similar qualities. (:",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:db5badf7fa89ceeca44ae402327e1c6d]] UPDATE 2/26/23 from 5 stars to 2:<br />The entire case has lost its wonderful frosted white look and the dreaded yellow has set in (actually it did a while ago, it's just taken me a while to update). The product description makes it seem like it would've been much longer before any signs of case aging would show but it only took about 2-3 months. I'm now in need of a new case and sadly will not be re-purchasing this one as the anti-yellow promise this company makes is yet another marketing ploy that didn't deliver. I've posted an update pic with the case on a white sheet to show the intensity of the color difference. If this case truly didn't yellow, it would hands down be my favorite case of all time.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW 9/26/22<br />I've been trying to find a case that checks off as much as possible from my list- thin, minimal, click-y/responsive buttons, and most importantly frosted (for anti-fingerprint). This case is not only exactly what I was looking for, but the fact that the package included so much for under $20 is fantastic! Contents were: frosted case, two screen protectors (already have one on so they're spares), two camera screen protectors, cleaning wipes, dust stickers, cleaning cloth, and some little decal stickers.<br /><br />My only one reservation is that this case, like all other clear/frosted ones, will most likely yellow with time. A lot of companies promise “never yellow, “anti yellow” but then you see reviews where photos show otherwise. For that reason I'm not gonna over-promise and say it's flawless; I will however say if you're looking for the same qualities in a case, this one is simply it! I will try and remember to update at the three month mark to say if there's been any yellowing or other problems. For now, 5/5!<br /><br />Side notes: I've never bought into the whole ‘camera screen protector' thing, but it actually works really well in keeping the lenses safe and there is no distortion/blockage at all from the protectors (I've attached a pic to show that). Also, the case is frosted just enough to still see the Apple logo. Hope this helps!",

    "text": "This is my first time using a Spigen screen protector as I normally go with the other brands that have good reviews. However, seeing as how other Spigen screen protectors had extremely positive and glowing reviews, I thought I would spend a little more and give them a fair try.<br /><br />The box came with two applicators with the screen protectors built in, wet cleaning wipes, a dry cleaning cloth, lint stickers, instructions, a squeegee, and a small misc card. Installation itself was a tiny bit confusing at first since this was my first time using this style, but after a rereading or two I was like “oh okay” and it was smooth sailing from there (my personal instructions are in the last paragraph).<br /><br />Transparent thoughts- I love how easy and precise the application is, but wow does it get dirty fast. Other screen protectors I've bought (I'm talking half the price for a 3 pack) have both been bubble free installation and stayed very clean for a while before losing the oleophobic coating. This one I've had for less than 24 hours and it's a lint magnet, has prints all over it, and cleans very smudgy which is terrible. I will make both of these last as long as I can, but I won't be buying them again. I'm super picky, so if you don't care about the little stuff and just want your phone protected, this is the way to go. Anyways, all in all they're not perfect but not the worst I've ever tried. I give them an honest 4/5.<br /><br />In case anyone is confused or needs more in depth instructions: wipe the phone with a wet wipe, wipe with the dry cloth, use a big lint sticker all over, make sure the applicator has the side with the pull tab face down (the side with the sticker with the numbers 1-3 should be face up), peel and quickly place the applicator down onto the phone, press in the middle and slide from 1 to 3, wait 30 seconds, peel from 3 to 1, lift up applicator, peel the tab off the screen protector, then squeegee out bubbles and you're done. TIP: if you're a perfectionist like me who despises even a single lint under the protector, before applying the applicator to the phone hold the screen protector in the right hand while blowing and getting ready to peel, then give one last good blow and very quickly peel and apply. This will ensure you get a flawless application without having to lift up the glass to try and sticker off any lint.<br /><br />Thank you for reading, I hope this helps someone out. I've attached photos including one of the back so people know this is a real review from a real paying customer with a real iPhone 13 Pro Max lol.",

    "text": "I ordered this because although I love clear cases, I despise dealing with fingerprint central and grime... it just grosses me out. No matter how much you clean the case and your hands, it's always smudgy and very unappealing. I looked around for a frosted case so that I could still see my phone's back without having to deal with the pet peeves of clear cases.<br /><br />I honestly can't say enough good things about this product. It's slim which gives you a ‘naked' feel of the phone, it's frosted so you don't have to see some in-your-face solid color that diminishes the Apple logo, it has precise cutouts and very responsive (or ‘clicky' as I like to say) buttons, and overall it just has a very nice minimalist, sleek appearance.<br /><br />The only two minor cons I can think of are that pop sockets won't stick as they're only meant for hard surfaces and that this case can attract lint so it needs to be brushed off or wiped down occasionally. For the people deducting stars for the “no protection” issue, well... yeah... it's a THIN case, it's meant to be very minimal so that you don't have to deal with the inconvenience of bulky/heavy ones. As for the front of the phone, get a screen protector and it'll be just fine.<br /><br />Upon submitting this (3/21/20) I'll have owned this for maybe about a month now and so far there has been no natural deterioration to the case from heavy daily use nor any scuffs or marks on the back from always laying it on that side. Bottom line, if you don't need ultra protection, are fine without using a pop socket, and hate dealing with clear cases but still wanna see your phone, this is the perfect choice!",

    "text": "Beautifully made, it has a very unique design. It isn't by any means a thin/minimalist case, there is bulk but it's not bad. There should definitely be protection because it has lips everywhere. I do have one small complaint which is the ‘clickiness' of the power and volume buttons. It's kinda hard to press them in which I was hoping would be a more easier thing to do. However, non issue. For the price, this was a steal. Highly recommend!!!",

    "text": "So, I'm a stickler for good tempered glass screen protectors. I'm particular about installation, bubbles, any included tools, how the protectors hold up, etc. Honestly, I am so in love with this brand.<br /><br />Installation is hands down the EASIEST out of all of the other brands I've tried (Insignia, the $40 kind from Best Buy, a couple from online, and many in between). All you have to do is use place the aligning tool on the phone (makes sure to take any case off), use one of the included wet wipes, make sure it's dry, then blow off any lint before quickly peeling the film off the protector and placing it right on. I've now applied this protector multiple times for myself and my boyfriend and there has never once been ANY bubbles while the protector settled into place. There is literally no way you can mess it up unless you don't follow instructions.<br /><br />As far as durability, I believe that's where it's lacking but ONLY by a little. I give it a 4/5 because it seems to scratch easily which is kind of a bummer. I only ever have it in my pocket or on a soft surface. Non issue though! I'm planning on ordering another two boxes since my boyfriend and I plan on keeping our XS Max phones another year.<br /><br />I highly recommend, it's the best product of its kind on the market at the moment.",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW (10/2/19): I am beyond happy to say that I am changing my review from one star to five. I had originally left a poor review because honestly the case was subpar. It wasn't thin as advertised (I have a collection of minimalist cases so I know when one really is or not), the buttons were hard to press in, and honestly it was just so heavy. I hated it. I never reached out for a refund or for an exchange because I figured the rest of their cases wouldn't be any good either. However, I was recently reached out to by a very helpful person named Sunny. They emailed me directly to thoroughly apologize for the product I received as well as offer a couple products as a second chance.<br /><br />I. Cannot. Explain. How. Happy. I. Am.<br /><br />I was sent one black and one clear case, and truthfully, I was expecting the exact same clear case I received the first time. However, I opened it up and snapped it on only to find that it is a totally different case than the one I first ordered. One, the bulk is gone, it is now an official minimalist case DONE RIGHT! Two, the buttons are now WAY easier to press! Three, it has an overall MUCH sleeker look! I'm not sure if they did a redesign, but if so then pleeeease keep it because this is what we minimalists want! The black one is just as gorgeous and is very thin as well; I ended up giving that one to my boyfriend because he was absolutely jealous of them!<br /><br />Thank you so much to Sunny for reaching out and making this a great experience for me with products that I can now recommend to friends and family!<br /><br />—————<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I just received my case and upon opening it, I clearly noticed the bulky size of it. It is the furthest thing from being a minimalist case. Also, the buttons are hard to press, they are not easily clickable.<br /><br />I will continue to use it until I get a new case, but honestly I am severely disappointed.",

    "text": "Update after 3 months of having this case:<br />Still 5 stars! I actually just upgraded to a new case, but I wanted to say this case never once scratched or marked up my phone in any way, caused any problems, or faded in color/quality. Actually, I had an accidental drop from my lap onto concrete recently while rushing out of a car and my phone didn't have a single crack or scratch show up as the case took the full blow. I must say, I'm officially impressed with this case.<br /><br />So I had ordered a $30 case from a well-known brand that said matte and when it came, it was clear and overall a terrible product, aside from having exposed buttons. I was hesitant to try again, let alone this product because of it not having many reviews, but I am beyond happy I did!<br /><br />This case is SUPER thin, lightweight, nice to look at, sleek, and it is what it says it is- frosted! I love these kind because they truly don't get any smudges or scuffs like the clear cases do, yet it's clear just enough so the whole phone can be seen! So this product is definitely 100% accurate in the description, especially with these precise cutouts- I'm very impressed!<br /><br />My ooooooonly complaint is that the buttons (volume and power) are kinda sunken into the cutouts, so it requires a little more effort to push. I originally thought the buttons would stick out to make for easier pressing. However, it's not a big deal at all which is why I'm not gonna deduct a star. Maybe the makers of this can come up with an updated version or a second version where they give those area-like cutouts instead of the precise ones.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this will fare when dropped, and I don't plan on dropping it because I'm very careful with iPhones, but to be completely honest this case is so thin that I strongly doubt it would give any kind of protection. This is one of those cases where you need to either have a pop socket, get  insurance, be diligent while using on the move, or all of the above. If you're clumsy, I'd advise against this one.<br /><br />Overall I'm extremely happy with how this looks! They makers really know how to apply precision and aesthetic into their products, and to think it's half of what I paid for the low-quality case from the other company? MNML, you have a returning and loyal customer now. Thank you!<br /><br />Side note: Definitely use with a screen protector as this case will not protect the front!",

Nothing about this case is matte, it is completely clear which I despise because of how easy it is to scuff up and get fingerprints on, vs a matte case which is resistant to both of those things. I know it says clear, but obviously matte is clear too because it is transparent, so I figured they were just stating the obvious. I'm so upset that I ordered a case that ended up being something totally different. I also hate how hard it was to snap on, it felt like it scratched my brand new phone. It made me cringe. There is also weird colorful marks that won't go away on the back (see second pic!) The only good thing about this case besides it being thin is how the buttons are exposed. Other than that, I hate it and am going to get a refund. Not even two minutes of the case being on the phone and it's already smudged and grimey. The title needs to be changed to say “clear” not “matte”!!!",

    "text": "I recently traded in my 8+ for the X, and naturally I wanted a case that seemed impossible to find. Meaning I'm picky when it comes to them. As in I have bought, refunded, and/or exchanged about 10 cases from stores within a 2 week period because I didn't like any due to them being bland, weak, unflattering, hard to use, etc. So, I took to Amazon and searched for days. I not only wanted something clear and thin, but something that had easy function, soft instead of hard to prevent scratching my phone, etc all while being highly rated.<br /><br />I just recieved my case (on time which is always nice) and I'm IN LOVE. No fancy packaging or anything, just a simple box containing a thank you note and the case itself. For all of you who enjoy peeling that plastic stuff off phones and accessories, heads up- there are two on the case! My initial thoughts on it were &#34;wow this is what I've been looking for!&#34; It seems very protective with the raised 'lips' around the front of the phone and the camera. It does already have fingerprints because, well, sadly all clear cases attract them, but it's not a big deal. I feel like it has good grip BUT if you're not careful, it could definitely slip out of your hands. My absolute favorite thing about this case is how clicky the power and volume buttons are! idk if I'm just that picky, but I HATE cases that force you to press the buttons hard to the point of your finger turning pink/red. Oh, and bonus points for extremely precise cutouts and it being lightweight!<br /><br />Overall this case is fantastic. I'm excited to show it off and return the last case I bought. I highly recommend this product! I am attaching many pics seeing as how there were none prior to purchasing this. Thumbs up from a picky iPhone X user!",

Literally it's only been two days and there are scratches all over the back, and it's not me because this phone has been in my hands or in my pockets all the time. And when it has been set down, it's been gently placed, not thrown or tossed. I honestly wouldn't recommend this and I hope I can switch this out. The ONLY reason I chose this case above anything else is because I love how the back of the iPhone looks and it's nice to see it on a daily basis. But then I see horrible smudges, prints, and all those scratches and it makes me regret my decision. Not to mention the buttons are ridiculous to press! It takes a lot of pressure to do anything with the volume and power!",

He appreciates that it comes with such an easy-to-follow instruction manual.  It may not be very intuitive for me to use as an iPhone/Android user, but it's perfect for his needs.  Perfect if you (or a non-tech-savvy loved one) want an easy-to-use phone that is just a phone!",

I think if you have had successful experience doing a screen protector before, this wouldn't be a problem. My only experience with a product similar to this was a very thin vinyl type plastic protector for an older phone I had, which was a world apart from the high quality and nice feel of this product.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a solid product, and if you're comfortable doing your own screen protector I would recommend it!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",

This one is great because it has a rubber bumper around the edge, with attractive metallic cut tons built in. It then slips inside of the firmer backing, giving additional protection to the back and sides of the phone. It was super easy to put on my phone, and definitely makes it feel more secure.<br /><br />It's a little slippery, but that's simply the nature of the material it's made of. Definitely less slippery than the feel of the aluminum alloy of the actual phone's backing. The glitter is perfect, not too little, not too much. Great cover!",

You can put the rear camera on the display with Picture in Picture or leave it off. I like to have the choice.

I write in my journal at night when I can't sleep and this is a great pen. The stylus part works excellent on my iPhone . Having 4 EXTRA pen refills AND two batteries means never having to run out of ink or light! I consider myself a bit of a pen fanatic and I have never gotten one with extras like this!  Now if I can only keep it on me and not lose it I will be thrilled  because having a stylus with me all the time will save me from text thumbs. Please make some in different colors ( like pink!)

It also holds the ring on the case and the magnetic circle for magnetic car phone holders. The metal circle holds the phone extremely securely on the magnetic phone holder in my car. It is so strong it won't fall off, even on rough terrain or sharp turns or breaking. The case has a lip on the edges to protect the face of the phone from drips and the cut out for the cameras is also lipped to add protection. The cutouts for charging and buttons are well placed and fit perfectly. My only complaint is that the ring, which is adjustable for a kickstand , is kind of loose. It jiggles and is kind of flimsy when holding it on your finger as it's intended. I feel like that will break over time. . The teal color is beautiful! The cover makes it easy to hold and gives you a better grip on your phone . I think if you add a tempered glass screen cover your phone will be perfectly protected from falls.",

The purple is a pretty and Is also a unique color.You don't see many in this shade of purple.  The case affords front protection by providing a lip around the phone to prevent it from contacting the ground if it falls face first. ( I still have a tempered glass screen protector also- I can't be too cautious when it comes to me and phones!) the case fits snugly and the cut outs for the ports are accurate and sufficient. The main reason I purchased this case was for the wallet feature- or ID and card storage, which  is a more accurate description.<br />It can hold your ID and two additional cards, or a small amount of cash. The magnetic clasp is secure unless you overload it. The ID slot is NOT clear- which would have been more convenient however it's easy enough to remove it from the slot with the thumb notch.<br />You can also use the flip out ID portion as a kickstand to keep your phone standing on its side for viewing . The one other feature I would have appreciated would be a D-ring and a wrist strap so I can keep it secure on my wrist.<br />Overall a pretty stylish case which provides good protection without adding too much bulk, ID storage and a built in kickstand.",

It comes with cleaning cloths both wet and dry, and a dust sticker to help you put it on a clean dust free screen. After cleaning , You put the plastic frame on your phone and peel the plastic off and you basically line up one end of the frame and drop it on your phone - you can't mess up. ( as long as your phone is dust free) it comes with a second glass cover in case you mess up.

    "text": "This is a wonderful case for people like me who are hard on their phones. One thing I like about it is that it has a clear back so the color of your phone shows through. It snaps easily and securely to protect your phone. To remove it easy there are notches on two corners to facilitate easy removal. The edges are rubberized and I have great confidence in the protection it affords. The holes or ports for charging and speakers are all aligned perfectly. The charging hole is made with enough room for a regular charger to work well while it's on.  The fingerprint sensor and keyboard work perfectly because there is no front screen. This is the only think I would change. In my opinion it needs a front screen to encase the phone completely.<br />UPDATE: after using the case on my phone for a while I had to knock off a star for a couple of reasons. The first thing is the case cuts off a LOT of the sound. I find myself putting up to the max volume and still have a hard time hearing . The other thing I notice is it makes the phone HOT! I have started taking the case off to charge it so it stays cool. The buttons are a bit harder to push through the case however I would trade ease of that for the protection it affords my phone anyway!",

This case has successfully protected my Galaxy from a number of pretty hard falls on wood and tile floors. Each time I cringed and thought it was new phone time.

    "text": "10/2012 -- UPDATE > After two months, the kickstand broke. There are four tiny pieces of plastic that slide up/down as you open or close the kickstand. One of them snapped off when opening. I have used the kickstand constantly, so maybe it just can't take heavy use for very long. It's cheap, so it's not a major issue. In fact, I will probably order another 'cause I still like the design and function. Sign of the times, I suppose: cheap, but disposable!<br /><br />=================================<br /><br />Saw what appeared to be the identical case in a wireless carrier's store for $30. Liked the look and feel of it, just didn't think it was worth that much. Got it on Amazon for much less.<br /><br />Some observations:<br /><br />1. It's a bit slippery, especially when you first start using it. Seems as if there's a residue on the surface. Wiped it down with rubbing alcohol; helped a bit.<br />2. The kickstand is very useful, though it's kind of hard to open at first. I use it more for actually holding the S3 than propping it up on a table or desk.<br />3. The top and bottom edges are pretty much exposed to drops when not in the holster. Knew that going in, though.<br />4. Love the combo/holster aspect. Don't store it in the holster all the time, but it's great having the option.<br /><br />Overall, highly pleased. Quite a nice case for a very reasonable price.",

I weighed it with my phone inside of it and it weighs 14.7 ounces! ALMOST a pound! Ridiculous!<br />2. The flat rubber backing puffs out over time and there is nothing you can do to stop or fix that!<br />3. The glass interferes with touching the screen... the phone screen doesn't respond to your touches and you have to keep touching it many times before you get it to respond and it is caused by the glass that is in the case.<br />4. The paint wears off over time and will go all over your face in little speckles that people will say... \"Hey, there's something on your face!\" all the time!<br />5. It is NOT waterproof, the moisture gets in through the speaker port for your ear.<br />6. The charger door will break/rip off over time.<br />7. It interferes with your service even if you are close to a tower!<br />8. The little screws will come out of the back and get lost and it doesn't matter how tightly you screw them into the case. (They do send extra screws with the case.)<br />9. It collects fingerprints, makeup, facial oil, and smudges on the screen that you will constantly be cleaning off.<br />10.

Have had phones for many years and never dropped and cracked a screen, but seems with the last phone and by my carrying it when I probably shouldn't, I have dropped it a few times too many.  I even had a wallet style cover which I loved, but it did not protect the phone from cracking when dropped like I thought it would.  So, I went on a mission to find a cover that covered the edges really well.  I can say, this cover does that.  I like that it is well padded on the corners and the padding extends around the front of the screen as well.  Does not block any part of the view of the screen.  Great secure cover for those who need extra padding because of carrying a phone at time when you probably shouldn't due to higher risk of dropping it.  Only downside is it makes the phone a lot larger, but that is a side effect I will have to live with.",

Needless to say that you will not be disappointed with this case.  It is also very soft.  I did not rate it with 5 stars because of the color.  The color is slightly different than the color on the picture provided.  The picture shows a lighter blue, but the case is actually a midnight blue (close to purple).  She still loves it though.",

It was a little difficult to get apart once I opened the package. I like it, but it would not be my first choice of a phone case. Microfiber cloth was not included with the case I received so I was unable to review it.  The belt clip only rotates at a 180 degree angle.  I would have liked it to rotate at 360.

Its almost like the design was made to hold the case upside down or for a left handed person. Once you get used to how it is set up your good to go. It just takes some time.

The adjustments for focal distance worked for centering the image as designed and the picture was of good quality compared to some other models tested.  This model has a slide out tray that holds your phone which is good if you dont have a remote to control the phone when in the headset, as it makes it easy to slide out quickly tap next video and slide it back in with little hassle.<br /><br />The only reason this headset has not received a 5 star rating is because other models had a removable front to keep phone cool and this only has a few little vents. I did find my phone gettin slightly warmer in this design.<br /><br />All in all this headset feels well made and works as designed. I would recommend it for purchase as it is just as good as other units that were $20+ more. If you have any questions you can email me difectly and i will try to help you out the best i can.<br /><br />** as stated above I did receive this product in exchange for this review but i do stand by the fact that this review is honest and unbiased in any way.",

It includes the alcohol pads and alignment and dust-removing stickers that you'll need to apply it properly. Very high quality here! I love it! I've gotten so tired of the bulky phone covers they make because I love how thin my phone is. So, when I saw that I could get this and a clear slim back cover, I was all over it. That way, the gold/rose gold tone to my phone can be seen, and it'll be basically the thickness of my phone, which is super thin!

I love using them both. The charge lasts for 3-4 hours, which is plenty for me. I use this mostly for listening to music and watching videos. I have not testing them for conversations. One word of advice, don't bother trying to pair them with an iPhone or iPad. Due to Apple's app structure which does not allow apps to contain volume control independent of the phone's volume, all music on an iPhone is going to sound super loud with no hope of turning it down, even on the lowest phone volume setting.  It's like all Apple apps are set to max volume.  As long as your phone/device allows for apps/programs to adjust volume from within the app/video, then it will work great. I wear this item most of the day and it does not give me ear fatigue. Most people don't notice it in my ear.",

Touch-screen in general is pretty good but pinch-zoom and some presses just don't work too well - though that may be due to my palm touching the curved edges of the screen, causing interference.

Don't bother with the fake leather ones under $20 (like \"PU Leather\" etc) - I've tried and returned them because they're all gimmicks and just paper thin veneers that feel fake. This case gets more comfortable with time, just like a leather baseball glove. The side buttons on the rubber phone holder part are very good - not hard to press and firm enough so no accidental presses either. The wallet part is still very firm so far, keeps the credit cards in there nicely. Magnetic button closure strap works well, though I've over filled the wallet a bit, so I don't use it much.",

It makes it a little bigger in size than some other chargers. However, the functionality makes up for it.<br /><br />Pluses<br />1. Charge a Qi or Qi compatible phone, along with an iWatch (with included charging pad) and Airpods (slot in top-back of charger)<br />2. Simple button opens the charger, then closes around the phone automatically. Use same button to open the charger to remove phone.<br />3. Comes with a dashboard mounting kit as well as vent mount<br />4. The package includes a quick charge DC adapter<br /><br />Minuses<br />1. Bulky, large<br />2. Galaxy Buds case too thick to fit into Airpod charging slot<br /><br />I was unable to actually test the watch & headphone charging options. But I can report that the wireless charging function works great with a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G & Galaxy S20FE.",

However, this kit is missing a very crucial part to its operation.<br /><br />Pluses<br />1. Charge a Qi or Qi compatible phone<br />2. Charger automatically sets the correct placement of the phone for optimum charging<br />3. Comes with a vent mount and USB charging cable<br /><br />Minuses<br />1. No DC power adapter included in box<br /><br />Once the charger is mounted to a vent & plugged into power adapter, press the button (raised dots) on top of the charging unit. The charger will open up. Place the phone onto the charger. It will automatically orient itself to find the optimum position for the phone. Press the top button again and it'll open itself up to allow removal of the phone. I can report that the wireless charging function works great with a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G & Galaxy S20FE.<br /><br />However, not including the DC power adapter is a major issue, in my opinion. Most USB ports in vehicles don't supply enough power for the quick charging function. And what if you don't have a USB port in your vehicle or an extra DC power adapter? Kind of inconvenient.<br /><br />If you already have a DC power adapter, then no concerns. This is a good charger.",

    "text": "Got this slighlty used phone for my wife as a replacement for a Samsung Galaxy S8.<br /><br />The screen size is not overly large, which works with her sensibilities of not wanting to carry around a mega screen phone.<br /><br />The fingerprint reader, screen brightness and choices to customize the phone to her liking is what my wife likes about the phone. The 128GB internal storage works perfect for app installs & the like.<br /><br />However, the big bonus is the inclusion of a  microSD card slot. This allows a person to add a ton of more storage at a lower price point that buying the phone with more internal storage. Internal storage may be faster, but in the value-vs-reward trade-off, I'd rather have the extra space at lower cost. My wife agrees, as the 256GB microSD card I installed satisfies all of her storage requirements.<br /><br />The Samsung Galaxy S21 is now selling, so this review may not be as relevant anymore. However, anyone looking for a good Android phone without the high price should give the Galaxy S10 a serious look.",

Fingerprints and smudges aren't overly noticeable and wipes clean pretty easily.<br /><br />I thought the install was mostly straightforward. However it can get tricky as you start to peel back the second layer. Once installed, the screen protector kind does some self-healing, in that it can be pushed back into proper position when it gets heated or moisture builds up. It's peeled up some on one side where it meets the phone case. I can't work the air bubble out of it. At some point, I'll just replace it with the 2nd protector included in the pack.",

They're a little brighter, but as long as you charge it with light facing downward, should be no problem.<br /><br />Some headphones will not be able to be plugged in with the case on. But Alpatronix includes a short extension cable to remedy that  problem. I can get about 1.5x charges before the battery is spent. It doesn't fast charge, but only takes about 2 hours to recharge. You can charge phone & case at same time, so expect charging to take longer.<br /><br />Overall a great battery case that does what it's supposed to do, and does it well.",

The way the pic looked was you got a back case and a cover for the front and the clip box. You only get the back cover and the piece it clips on to you with. First I didn't need that box I already have 20 laying around my house that go to waste so that part was useless to me. Now for the cover itself it doesn't even work with the s10. The first thing I do when I get a case is try and use all the buttons to make sure everything lines up. The volume buttons worked fine, however, I tried taking a screenshot and couldn't. I was confused why not. Tried again and still nothing. Here the plastic piece on their case doesn't line up on the right side of the phone with the power button. When you are pushing their power button all it does is hit the side of the phone and not your actual power button, because the power button is lower. Also, the case is hard to get off. It's hard plastic with no give at all which you might think is good but when it comes to getting your phone out well I was worried I would snap my phone trying to remove it. It doesn't protect your actual screen in anyway. If you drop it and it lands on the screen your screen will shatter if it hits just the right way. There were no raised edges or anything to give it a little cushion from the glass smacking any surface. So if you placed your phone screen down the glass would hit the table. Definitely not a product I would recommend until they fix a couple issues with the case. Had this item returned within 24hrs.",

The replacement cover didn't seem as strong as the original, but it's definitely better than the broken old cover! :) And, I've had my phone 1.5 years and have never had a back cover break like this before (I use a slim plastic case with corner bumpers), so I'll be happy if this replacement lasts a year.<br /><br />Except for a blow dryer (to warm the old glue), the package had everything I needed and it only took me less than 15 minutes from start to finish, including the time to pick off every bid of old glue.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'd buy this again. It met my expectations and my phone looks nice again!",

This is similar to the softer of the two cases that came with the OP 6T; I like this better as it is slightly easier to grip. It also has slightly thicker corners and slightly better cut-outs (a bit wider at the usb outlet, a bit smaller at the camera.

I would run with it, hike, etc. so maybe if you only wear it for dressy occasions, it'll last. The band starting coming apart at the seams. Had to toss it.<br />——<br /><br />Easy to install on my Apple Watch. Size is appropriate for my wrist. No issues with it coming undone. Looks nice- as pictured.<br /><br />I expect a lot from this band. I mean I wear it every day so it better hold up. I have worn this about a week.<br /><br />Day 1: VERY STIFF. Hard to even get the watch on and buckled. Definitely took a few days to loosen up<br /><br />Week 1: getting more comfy. Not bothering my wrist anymore. Noticing some “bending” marks and lightening in the material from getting stretched I guess?<br /><br />The rest of my life: I'm glad I got the retro brown because it looks super worn after only a week. I'm hoping it doesn't crack, but only time will tell.<br /><br />So far, I would say I recommend it. For the price, I'm happy with it. It looks much better than the sport band.",

It looks like half of a case, you snap it on the front of your phone, and align the screen protector. BOOM. that easy!!!<br /><br />I have used many many different brands and always end up with bubbles or uneven application or dust... just lots of issues! This is truly the only protector I've used that installs perfectly every time.<br /><br />In conjunction with my repurchase of these protectors, I bought another brand which was a pack of 3 for half the price. I figured I would use the cheaper protectors with the tethys installation guide and save a little money. I will say the other protectors are thinner and smaller? Tethys claims edge to edge protection, and now I can easily confirm they live up to that claim!!<br /><br />I have been using Tethys protectors on my iPhone X for about 1.5 years now and I will continue to repurchase. Currently a 3pc for $5 is absolutely unbeatable. 100% professional looking. I can't rave enough.",

The multi output cables are great ! It can be used to charge just about anything ! The bright orange helps me keep track of it . I'd order this again and would feel pretty good about giving this as a gift for a loved one to make sure they can always have an emergency phone charging capacity no matter where they are !! It shows you on the front how much of a charge is still in the battery pack . I feel like it is idiot proof and extreamly user friendly. Everything being attached is pretty great too .can't misplace cords or the charger needed to charge it . Yeah baby it's that good !! Try it you will like it !! My kids are jelly and want one for the devices they play with on long car rides . I'm thinking about ordering one for our daughter away at college so she always has a way to make sure she can make calls if anything ever happens .

Holds an Ok charge for a couple days if I just text and talk a small amount. I don't use the net or anything on my phone, just call, text and camera. Camera is ok...wish it was higher mpx but this is alright. I am still on the hunt for a not very smart phone with qwerty and great camera...this was as close as I could get this time.",

Be careful when you buy it...my other one had a more standard QWERTY.  This one is basically fine, but it's a French version or something.  The question mark and exclamation are in a different place (which is surprisingly annoying).  Also, you can find the remedy through kind people who have posted the solution in Amazon, but if you have AT&T (maybe others too), you will be unable to send/receive picture messages/texts until you do some manual configuration.  Once you have the directions, it is super fast and easy, but there is no way I would have figured it out on my own!!!  Lastly, I am sending my second one back today because it simply stopped working.  I&#34;m so disappointed.",

Not good. Also, any other sounds on the iPhone are still connected to the headset including all apps and Music.<br />This makes the sensor almost useless because you have to remember to turn off the headset when you leave your office for another room.",
