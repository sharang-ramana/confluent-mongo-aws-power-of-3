    "text": "I've been using this Sony Xperia X and comparing it side by side with my two month old LG V10 for almost a week now. The first and most obvious difference, of course, is the size - my LG is a 5.7&#34; screen and the Sony is a 5&#34; screen. On paper that seems obvious, but it's not so easy to picture until you actually see the two phones side by side. The good thing is the smaller 5&#34; screen slips easily into most pants pockets, but it also means that the beautiful clarity of the screen can't be as fully enjoyed as it might be on a larger size.<br /><br />The unlocked status of this phone meant my current AT&T SIM card was active immediately when I swapped it from my LG to the Sony and back - zero problems. The micro SD card was recognized immediately and is holding apps, games and photos as it should. I was expecting the unlocked version to have significantly less bloatware than the typical carrier purchased phone and while this does have less, it is not bloat free. There are a number of hard loaded Sony apps and things like Facebook and Spotify that you can't delete. (I realize most people want Facebook, but I am not one who wants it as a mandatory, intrusive app on my phone)<br /><br />In comparison to the LG V10 in performance - the LG runs faster with 3 or more apps going at once. For example, texting and watching a YouTube video and doing email at once on the LG is smooth and lag free. The Sony stutters and the YouTube video ended up buffering and had to be stopped when a flurry of texts came in. It took me awhile to figure out why, but I realized it is because the Sony doesn't hold a WiFi connection as well as the LG in the same room, side by side on the same network. My LG and my husband's Blu phone will both show full strength Wi-Fi signal and this phone next to them will show 2/3 strength. Same results in three different homes with three different routers and networks - it just doesn't have great reception.<br /><br />What I absolutely love about the Sony Xperia X is the camera and the Xperia movie builder app. Holy cow does this thing take pretty pictures! It is spectacular at outdoor nature shots and especially backlit shots in bright sunlight. Taking multiple action pictures of horses galloping and changing directions was very nice - 12 shots in a row and only one was blurry. The details and color it gets with flowers and animals are so good that I am taking this phone on vacation to a National Park in a couple of weeks specifically to use as a camera. (My LG V10 is going as my communication device) The built in movie builder app is just a cute little gizmo that takes your still shots & puts them to music and makes a video for you - I've had a ball with it and the horse pictures.<br /><br />The phone comes with a fast charging wall charger and it is quick. The Bluetooth connected easily with my Echo and a pair of generic headphones and my Ford Sync system. So far the battery life has been excellent and slightly better than on my LG. My bottom line is that this is a decent phone and an excellent camera, but in the final tally, I think the poor WiFi reception and laggy behavior with multiple functions running at once means that I won't be leaving my LG V10 and making the Sony X my daily phone.<br /><br />******  UPDATE August 5 2016. ******<br /><br />I added the Magic Jack app to this phone recently for use with our Magic Jack account when traveling overseas. It allows you to call the United States without incurring international roaming fees by using a Wi-Fi connection. In initial testing this week, it is working, but the weak Wi-Fi reception on this phone makes this function sketchy unless you are in just the perfect spot.",

    "title": "Absolutely protects from drops & water exposure. Can hold heat & inhibits easy batter swapping",
    "text": "I just spend a small fortune on a new LG V10 phone - these things are really just small computers and they need to be protected as such. Mine goes everywhere with me, including the horse barn and out in the woods and pastures on horseback. I drop my phones and sometimes they get grabbed by the Donkey, so I don't mess around when I am picking a case for for use outside. I trust OtterBox - it saved a Blackberry several years ago after I dropped it in a four foot deep water trough.<br /><br />This case is the traditional Otterbox three layer protection I've come to expect. I already have a tempered glass screen protector on my phone of course, but the additional plastic cover from the Otterbox doesn't make any significant difference when using the touchscreen. With just the basic cover on and locked, you have full access to the camera, the volume rockers and the power button/fingerprint scanner. The charger slot is easily used by lifting up the flap on the bottom of the case and it closes again.<br /><br />Putting the third piece on, the rubber bumper is both where you get the absolute best protection and lose the full functionality of your phone. First - I've noticed a couple of times where the rubber bumper slips just a tiny bit and can interfere with the flash on the camera.  Second - One of the things I love about the LG V10 and the primary reason I purchased it was for the ability to change out the battery when I am not able to get to a charger. Like...out at the barn working with the horses. Which is also where I need the Otterbox case the most. I have to remove the entire three piece system to get to my phone and swap the battery out and then go through the rigamarole of snapping everything back together again. (I know, I know...first world problem.)  Third - If I am using the pedometer app, using bluetooth to send music to a speaker, and perhaps checking email all at once with the bumper on, the phone can get a bit hot. If it's just the two piece case, this does not happen. My main problem is that if you use the holster back then you cannot access the power button or volume at all unless you remove it entirely.<br /><br />So I do essentially love the Otterbox and I will continue to use it every day that I am out at the barn because it absolutely will save my phone at some point. History has proven this to be true. I just have to make sure I start my morning with a fully charged battery on an Otterbox day.",

    "text": "I have used the iCarez screen protectors in various formats on multiple devices for several years with excellent results every time - I currently have them on two Fire tablets and it was a no brainer to go directly to iCarez for a tempered glass protector for my brand new LG V10 phone. (I also watched a video online of a guy hammering his and then removing it - no damage at all to his phone) The instruction booklet inside said that they have simplified the installation process, so I scanned the bar code and watched the video before I did anything. Sure enough, it's easier than last summer when I put the last one on a tablet. Plus the clarity and gorgeous display are in no way degraded by this glass protector - my photos etc are still just as sharp and pretty as before.<br /><br />The key here is be vigilant about making the screen absolutely pristine before you apply the protector and to do it on a level surface. I used the kitchen counter top. Wipe the phone all in one direction with the provided wet wipe and then the dust cloth. REPEAT. Repeat again and do not touch the screen. Wait a few seconds for it to dry completely. Then apply the screen protector - since this is a tempered glass unit, it's stiff and will set in place much more easily than the old fashioned plastic ones, but it's also harder to re-position, so go slow and get it right. This unit is precisely measured and fit my phone exactly on the first attempt and I have zero bubbles. See the photo.",

The fit is correct and the case doesn't interfere in any way with the camera, flash, volume rocker or the fingerprint sensor/power button. I have zero problems using my phone or the fingerprint scanner with this case on it.<br /><br />My one drawback is that if you want to take this case off and do a battery swap on a super busy day (and let's be honest - the V10 is awesome, but a battery hog), it can be difficult. The gold metal rim part fits so snuggly that it is hard to get off without stretching the rubber case. Do this often enough and the case itself won't fit correctly in the long run.

    "text": "This is my first experience with a BLU brand phone and my first experience with a dual SIM card phone, but not the first trip down the aisle with Android phones. My current phone is a Fire Phone and previously I used an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note, so I had an idea of what to expect and what I hoped to find in the BLU Studio Energy 2 that is/was missing from the other two. BLU definitely hit a homerun here.<br /><br />The physical phone is a bit heavier than some of the other flagship phones out there, but with the big battery that's to be expected. The body is a deep grey color with snap off back that is tight enough to require deliberate effort to remove. Inside you find the dual micro SIM card slots and the SD card slot. All three installed easily for me and worked immediately with no drama. We initially tested this phone using a prepaid AT&T Go Phone SIM card from a local store. No problems at all and the service was going and we were making and receiving calls & text messages in ten minutes.<br /><br />The battery in this thing is simply amazing. Before installing a SIM card, we charged it over night and turned it on at 6pm on Tuesday. My husband and I both used it as a mini tablet on WiFi only - we played games, streamed music from Amazon Prime, watched videos, surfed the net, did email, plugged in a Google account and downloaded apps, took photos, Bluetooth connected to the Echo and the car. For two full days without ever charging the phone! On Friday morning at 7:30am it still had a 51% charge left. Even after installing the SIM card and making calls, I didn't recharge the phone until Saturday morning.<br /><br />The calls are clear and clean both incoming and out going. The signal strength is solid - that certainly will vary depending on your location and service provider. BLU has some of the best built in ringtones I've ever seen in a cell phone - the rendition of Hallelujah is lovely. Adding and making my own ringtones for each contact was painless. We haven't tested our European SIM card yet for calls, but the phone recognized it with no issues. The camera is pretty good and has a variety of settings to choose from if you don't want to eat up space with a photo app. One thing I really like is noticeably less bloatware on this phone than the Samsung Note I had previously. The 1.5 GB Ram and quad core processor shine through - with 5 web pages open and switching between three active apps, I have not seen any sluggish behavior or stuttering at all. It just works - even while downloading several songs and playing Angry Birds at the same time with a text conversation going.<br /><br />BLU has thoughtfully included a rubberized bumper style cover, screen protector, earbuds and two charging cables with the phone. It's ready to be a part of your life immediately. Just sign in, pop in your SIM card and go. For the price, features, and the freedom of being an unlocked world phone, combined with this awesome battery - I am converted. There is no reason to buy an over priced phone from the carriers ever again. I'm keeping this one and buying a second one for my husband.<br /><br />******* UPDATE NOV 7, 2015 *******<br /><br />My husband took this phone with him to Amsterdam this past week and it worked with no problems. He also used the Magic Jack app in conjunction with our existing Magic Jack account and the free WiFi at the airport - worked perfectly. No international minutes used on either SIM card that way.",

I attached it to my pants belt loop walking dogs in the woods - my phone wasn't at risk of falling out of my pockets while throwing a ball or wrestling around with the hounds.

The photos are a little fuzzy, but you do have a barrier in front of the lens. No deduction there. My one issue was using this with my Fire Phone - the four sensors on the front of the Fire Phone detect any covering as a face and black out the screen entirely. Thus making it impossible to use this with that phone inside. Trying it with my old Galaxy Note 1 was not a problem at all. I was also able to fit my driver's license and a few dollars in the case with the phone - very handy. Like the other version of this case from Wiszen, this one is very good and does exactly what it says it will do.",

It's more like a smooth cover or shell for the back of your Fire phone, a swatch of color that at most, prevents the back and sides of the phone from being scratched and scuffed up. It's a soft, rubber like material that is very thin and doesn't add any bulk to my Fire Phone - this is one good thing, you can slip the phone right in your pants pocket with this shell on it. The cover doesn't provide any protection at all for the front of the phone and to be honest, if you drop it on the sidewalk or a tile floor, I doubt it would really help much on the back of the phone.<br /><br />The cover does fit perfectly, all the cutouts for the Firefly button, volume and power buttons are exact and the flash & camera all work exactly with it on. My grey cover looked very nice on my phone, but to be honest, I only used it for two days before I had a scare and went back to my Poetic flip case which can be closed to cover the face of the phone when it's in your purse etc. I was sitting at the dining table playing Tofu Fury on my phone which requires some moving around - sure enough, the phone slipped a bit and almost dropped  3 inches from my hands to the wood table top. My friend commented that maybe I needed an &#34;actual&#34; case with some padding and something that would absorb an impact. And that is the reason for the two star deduction - no real protection for what is in reality, a very expensive hand held computer.",

The only complaint is that the hand strap has to be purchased separately at an additional cost - I was going to use the strap from my other Zenus case, but it totally doesn't match. The little kickstand on the back is a neat idea and implemented nicely. It stays closed when not in use via a tiny magnet so it's never popping loose or in the way when you don't need it. One note to future buyers - this case ships from Korea and takes about a week to ten days to arrive. Not a big deal - mine arrived in excellent packaging and within 10 days since I ordered it.

My Mother got a pair in the black leather and ended up buying a half size smaller than normal as well. I have wide feet and the tie on top of the toe box does loosen a bit giving just a tiny bit more room where the sides of your toes sit inside the shoe so they don't rub.

    "text": "In the month I have had my new Galaxy Note, I have tried four cases and three different types of belt clips and ended up ticked off and aggravated each time. Until the Cellet Executive Case. This thing looks good and actually works! First the Note slides into the case from the top and it fits as it should. Then the flap of the case folds down over the top - preventing the phone from falling out if the case is upended.<br /><br /> Secondly the case snaps closed with an actual snap instead of a magnet on the bottom - securely holding your phone inside the case where it belongs. Third - the top flap is elevated just a bit so that when it's snapped closed the top part does not scratch your phone screen - even with something tucked into the packet of the flap. I still use a screen protector, but the spacing is a nice perk with this case. There is a tiny little loop on the outside edge of the case where you could attach a cord (like you would on a camera).<br /><br />Fourth - the belt clip is built into the case rather than an after thought add on. It is also stitched on, so one can assume it should stay in place with regular use. Two full days of use and the belt clip has held my Note nicely in place on my hip while out at the barn working with the horses - the last two I tried both failed and broke within hours! The leather on the case is smooth and looks good - there is a light saddle tan color on the inside that contrasts very nicely with the black exterior. The cutouts for the camera, S-Pen, speaker and volume buttons are all placed correctly and do not interfer with normal use of the phone's features. My only complaint is that the power button cutout slightly overlaps the actual power button, so you have to push through a tiny sliver of leather - not a big deal at all in the general overview. Certainly not enough of a problem to warrant a star deduction.<br /><br />On a humorous note - the first day using this case had my Mother laughing out loud. Apparently flipping the top back to use the phone reminded her of the old Tri-corders from the original Star Trek. Now...admittedly, I am a total Sci-Fi geek, so this does have a certain appeal. I am ordering a second one of these cases as a back up for the future. Definately worth every penny!",

I used this very lightly THREE TIMES and teh plastic clip fell apart. The lever you pinch back to open the clip broke in half and then while I was looking at it, the circle part on the back that slides into the knob on your phone case actually crumbled in my hand! WTF? When I say I used it lightly, I mean I put the phone in my pocket and attempted to attach the clip to the pocket lip on my jeans.

The one thing Blackberry does better than anyone else out there is conservation of battery power with their devices. I adore my new Note and all it's slick functions & abilities and of course the giant screen. The trade off is insane power consumption, so finding a spare battery & charging dock was one of the first things I did when I made the switch. This charger stand carries the Samsung brand name & an original Samsung battery for the Note and it works perfectly. I find I can run through an entire charge in less than 8 hours of steady use some days - email, music, audio books, calls and the like. Having a second fully charged battery ready to go is a must! The power cord works with the dock and directly with the phone if you need. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.",

Primarily my interest is in keeping my phone from falling into a water bucket etc while I'm working and being able to listen to podcasts or music while working.<br /><br />This case is thin and easily allows access to both the sleep button and the volume and doesn't impede your ability to use the touchscreen or home buttons and it doesn't poke your cheek when you make a call with it on the phone. The case fits very snugly around the phone and then you slide the phone with the case on into the second part that has the spring clip. I seriously doubt the phone could ever fall out of this case! My ONLY complaint is that if you put the phone into the clip piece in one direction you cannot access the earphone jack and if you flip it over to use your earphones, you cannot have it attached to a charger while in the case. One the belt clip piece is attached you also lose access to your camera - again, if you flip the phone around and put it with the screen facing inside & the camera lense facing outside, you cannot interact with the phone. That is the only reaason for the single star deduction. On the plus side, this case will work nicely at the barn or out walking the dogs and that's all that you really need for less than $10.",

It would have been helpful if the instructions booklet had a slightly better diagrams, but I figured it out. Meanwhile the good stuff.... charges fast! It has a small white light that goes on when your phone is aligned properly on the mat and makes this wierd chirping noise to let you know it is aligned properly and when you move it. (It's a pretty distinct sound - nothing like the little beeps etc your phone normally makes for incoming messages and the like) Honestly I am really liking this whole Powermat idea - no more fumbling with that tiny micro USB charging cord and the plug in on the phone!

    "text": "After suffering real pain every single day using the headset that came standard with my new Blackberry Torch, I knew I had to make a change or give up listening to my audio-books and music. Giving up the music, podcasts, podiobooks and handsfree phone use is NOT an option - I work outside with horses several hours a day - gotta have my media! The set of earbuds that came with the phone worked well, but my ears a tad small and they were just too big. Plus the hard metal & plastic literally caused a painful bruise on one ear. After tons of research I decided on these for several reasons. As it turns out these are very good both with regard to sound and actual daily functionality.<br /><br />They are a Blackberry product thus compatible with my phone. They have a microphone and a remote control with the volume, skip and pause on the cord - no need to remove the phone from your holster or pocket! All these buttons worked properly as soon as the headset was plugged into my phone. (No learning curve or difficulty with the new Blackberry OS.6) One note on the remote control - there is a 2 second delay from the time you initiate a command before the phone reacts. If you have voice dialing set up on your Torch it can work with this headset and that is very nice. Sound quality is good with simple voice narration from an audio book. The sound is very good with actual music - in fact this headset is louder than the original, which means I no longer have to keep the volume at it's highest level. Additionally, if you click the options in the BB menu on your phone, you can adjust the sound to reflect the type of music you're listening to and this headset does reflect the change. The carrying case is hard and fits well in a purse or the center console of the car. But most importantly the ear buds are size adjustable with the three different size tips included. The multiple options are easy to change out and since one of my ears is slightly smaller than the other I can put a small tip on the left and a medium tip on the right side - NO MORE PAIN!!<br /><br />I like these so much I am considering buying another set for travel.<br /><br />*************Jan 2012 UPDATE ***********************<br /><br />After almost a full year of regular use, these headphones are working just fine with no issues at all. Additionally they work nicely with my Kindle (audio books) around the house. I have had no problems with them at all.",

    "text": "I finally dumped the low battery time, irrational malfunctioning Razr phone in November and upgraded to the Blackberry Curve 8310 in red. It's like upgrading from a Yugo to a Mercedes SLK. I have had none of the negative issues some of the other reviews mention - access through the 3G system for the internet, phone calls, email etc is speedy and consistantly works when asked to. I had AT&T service before with the Razr phone in the same location and had problems with reception all day long. That problem vanished with the Curve. I am finding that my email appears on my phone within just a minute or two after it appears on my computer.<br /><br />LOVE the clarity of photos taken with this phone (it's a phone camera so photos are never going to be as nice as with a high end digital camera, but they are far superior to those with my old phone) I have also found it very easy to sync with my computer and swap/download music, files, photos and the like between the phone and computer. Overall, I would spend full price for this phone any day [...]. This is the first cell phone in 7 years I have been totally pleased with and glad that I bought.",

    "text": "Finger print reader is under screen and it's a little slow but works fine. The battery life is flipping Amazing! Screen quality is amazing! Up to 160hz refresh rate. Only phone in the world right now that can do that. You do have to unlock 160hz option under developer options but comes sweet at 144hz. With xmode gaming mode on over seen the cpu do over 2ghz! Just a seamless super fast phone! Camera is awesome also. Has time lapse, slow mo, 4k  and pro mode to make a few. I can't say enough good things. The shoulder trigger buttons have each their own strong hepatic feed back motor so it feels like your really clicking a physical button. You can map the shoulder triggers for any game to use any buttons you want . You can also change how the triggers work for example you can use them like triggers in call of duty mobile for aim then shoot. You can use them as sliders to do different functions depending on how you slide your finger over the shoulder buttons. You can set the pressure of how hard u need to squeeze the buttons before they do something it's all tunable I live this phone to sum it up the whole phone is tunable to what you prefer. Every aspect you can change. Lights, themes, even has built in equalizer called sound wizard very cool. Speakers are amazing! One thing I've noticed that if you carry this phone in your pocket little pieces of lint and stuff do go right into the speaker grills and that bugs me but that's the only fault so far. Charging is also amazing it has a program that helps you choose how to take care of your giant battery. You can fast charge at 35w super fast I've had mine charge way faster than I see in the YouTube videos. Battery lasts for days. At 94 percent I've played cod mobile for 4 hours and still had 40 some percent battery left! You can also turn on slower charge and limit how full you want the battery to get so you can have your battery live a very very long life. I use the slow charge mode and it still charged faster than my old black shark 1.",

    "text": "My Samsung Galaxy Sky Pro phone had started acting screwy, with the battery going DOWN and/or shutting itself off when I plugged in a charger. I tried 3 different chargers, as I thought maybe one had died off, but I had the same problem with every cord.<br /><br />I figured the entire phone was dying. Tyen one of my kiddoes suggested trying a replacement battery first. So, I ordered this one. I chose it based on the model number from the one in my phone. The one I received from my purchase did not have the same model number on it, so I was a little nervous it would not work.<br /><br />I popped it in and plugged in a charger cord. Yay! It started actually charging. My phone didn't shut off. It only took about 20 minutes to get a full charge.<br /><br />So, if your phone starts acting up, not charging right and turning itself off, try a new battery as your next step. This was shipped quickly and arrived new and well-packaged.",

It turns a small phone screen into a screen about the size visually of a portable dvd player.<br /><br />My husband had a lot of trouble getting his phone to stay in place with the thin plastic flap on the tray part. He got around this by using a different metal phone holder (also purchased on Amazon) to hold his phone in place and moving the screen in front of it.<br /><br />In my opinion, they have a good thing going with this screen magnifier, but it could be very good if they used thicker plastic on the rest of the unit. It would be worth a couple bucks more to get a version that is more stable and sturdy.",

We add a card to the reserve a few days before the<br />30 days is up. Each and every time so far, the phone stops DEAD on the 30th day, and the reserve<br />does not automatically roll over. Each time, we have to call tech support (a long, long wait<br />to reach someone who does not speak English as their native language) and go through the arduous<br />process of resetting the minutes and having him text *2_ _ _ _ (some number, not sure what it is)<br />to reactive the phone.<br /><br />That part is beyond ridiculous.<br />It is annoying, time wasting, and very inconvenient when you use your phone for work.<br /><br />At this point, we are ready to change.

Apparently, the inconvenience is<br />limited to the All You Need, perhaps in some twisted attempt to get to you upgrade to the more<br />expensive plan.

Again, fabulous results from<br />The Friendly Swede - well packaged, shipped quickly and great pens!<br />When I opened the package, I was immediately swarmed with (older) kids wanting a certain color!<br />(That's fine with me, but there WILL be trouble if anyone takes Mom's green one! I have permanent<br />'dibs' on anything in apple green that enters the house. Ha!)<br /><br />If you are not having as great a response with your touch screen as you might like, check your pen.<br />There are differences in the quality of these pens (although a lot of people sell them now), and they DO<br />wear out. My old pen (from the same seller) did not look that bad, but I noticed that I was having to drag<br />or retouch some things more often. The pen didn't look worn out, but it was getting there. (Using it several<br />times every day for months - go figure that it wore out!) The new pen made an immediate difference.<br /><br />I just don't think you can find a better pen or a better seller. The color combinations available here are<br />beyond compare (and what first caused me to purchase here). Everyone will find something that they like.<br />The seller also offers a big variety of pen SIZES, so if you have very small hands, you want one for a child, or<br />you need a bigger size, you'll find a pen here that will work for you.<br /><br />I'm just so pleased with these. I got six pens for a little less than I paid for ONE pen from another seller.<br />The more expensive pen came in a nice box (which was immediately discarded), but it didn't really do much else.<br />That was why I came back to Amazon to shop for a different pen in the first place.<br />You don't have to shop here, but honestly, why would you want to shop any place else?<br />Yes, I'm a huge fan - when you've never had a bad experience with a seller, you notice!<br /><br />So, add some color to your life, and grab a package of these capacitive pens. They work so well!<br />I wore mine out on my Nook, but my kids use them for the Nook, Fire and of course, their phones.<br /><br />Thank you, The Friendly Swede, for making a great product, and providing outstanding service!",

    "text": "We bought this case for an LG Optimus S (slider phone) from Wal Mart.<br />It fits very well!<br /><br />The case comes in three pieces in a bag with no instructions, but it isn't<br />too hard. (If it is, then you might want to rethink the need for a \"smart phone\"<br />in the first place.) There is a black rubber base for the bottom, and the<br />skeletal portion snaps on to the bottom case over the black part. The third piece<br />is a thin case for the slider portion. Just be careful with this part - it is easy<br />to get it upside down and it could break the tiny snap-on parts on the underneath of<br />the case.<br /><br />There are many reviews about the color mis-representation in this listing.<br />I have to say that I expected it to be pink, not purple, based on other reviews.<br />Here's the thing - have you ever seen that car paint that looks one color from one angle,<br />and another color from another angle?  That's what the deal is here... what color you<br />see depends on the angle you are viewing from.  I am including a couple photos to show<br />what I mean. I also did a mini-movie so folks could see it, but I'll upload that at a later date.<br /><br />The case itself feels so neat - sort of a velvetly-textured rubber. It is definitely<br />comfortable in the hand, and helps make the phone not so slick to hold. The top piece<br />doesn't really block the slider or keys at all. It does take up a miniscule amount of space<br />right at the top row of keys, but you'd have to have very large thumbs to be affected by that.<br />If you need to access your battery you'll have to take the case back off, but just do it<br />carefully so the little snap-on spots don't break off.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good case, and we're glad we got it. How it holds up remains to be seen,<br />but I don't anticipate a lot of problems. It is worth buying.",

While it works fine, you get more for your money with these.<br />Plus, the colors are GREAT!  Who ever said the pens had to be boring?<br />If you wear a black suit and white shirt to work every day, then these might<br />not be your thing. But if you love color, love variety, then try them!<br /><br />They are a little bit shorter than my other pen, but they work better, IMHO.<br />They are not little nubby pens, but run maybe an inch shorter than the expensive ones,<br />and are shorter than a regular ink pen.<br /><br />Gotta say that now I am interested in getting more colors of this pen.<br />They are comfy, colorful and work great!<br />Quick shipment too...<br />It's all good!",

Without exception, the Friendly Swede styluses are clearly superior to the several other brands I've tried.<br /><br />I've used rubber tips and fiber tips and prefer the fiber tips.  This brand comes out on top in both versions, but it's especially evident of the fiber tip styluses.  They “register” as far as immediate recognition much faster and cleaner than the alternatives I've tried.  I do quite a lot of fine detail work.  With other brands, I would need to touch/drag multiple times before it actually selected or moved text or item.  Not so with the Friendlly Swede.  It works every time with no need to repeat the gestures.<br /><br />The multipacks are a good bargain as you get extra replacement tips (and instructions on how to swap out the bad tip for a new one).  I like to tuck an extra stylus in my travel bag just in case I misplace one (yes, it has happened before).<br /><br />This will be my “go-to” brand for styluses in the future -- no more succumbing to the temptation of a lower-price “bargain.”  You really do get what you pay for.",

The other goes in my emergency travel/\"hospital\" bag.  Unfortunately, I've had to make several ER trips over the past 1.5 years that have resulted in hospital admission -- and while I always have my iPhone with me, I haven't had the means to recharge it, depending on friends or hospital staff to help out until I can my hands on a charging cable/etc.  I now maintain a \"grab and go\" bag for those times when I'm headed off somewhere where I might need to recharge my phone, packing a few toiletries, nightclothes, etc. AND this charger plus a charging cable or two.  I'll be checking it every month and recharging it as needed so that if I need to head off to the hospital, it will be fully charged.<br /><br />I like that it also has the flashlight feature -- although I always have flashlights laying around the apartment -- but it never hurts to have more.<br /><br />Honestly, I have no complaints about this at all.  It charges both iPhone 12 mini and IPad Pro multiple times on a single charge, so it works perfectly as far as I'm concerned.  If anything changes as to performance/etc., I'll definitely revise my review, but for now, it's a solid 5 stars from me.",

    "text": "I prefer these elastic bands for my Series 6 Apple Watch as I use it for monitoring O2, pulse, exercise, etc., and it needs to fit securely on my wrist.  Elastic bands allow for more flexibility in terms of how tight the band is worn, so this works well for me.<br /><br />I purchased this set of 2 bands (the multi-colored \"rainbow\"-ish ones) mostly for the colors -- we're heading into spring here in the Pacific NW, which means our gray cloudy chilly days will soon be replaced by less-gray sunnier warmer days -- with the burst of spring color that follows.  It just seemed fitting to replace my gray stretchy band with a multi-colored stretchy band.<br /><br />In terms of quality, I have no complaints at all.  The band stays secure -- it doesn't loosen with wearing (I think another review mentioned that -- it hasn't happened in my case).  The \"clasp\" (more like a sliding size adjustor) stays put, and no metal touches my skin (I'm kind of allergic to some metals) -- no discomfort there at all.  Many versions of this type of stretchy band have plastic size adjustors which kind of cheapens the look in my opinion.<br /><br />No problems at all with these -- I like them a lot and will likely purchase another set for summer wear.",

My wrist tends to run a little large (around 8\") and not all bands fit, so I figured elastic might be a good choice.<br /><br />These are adjustable, so I'm able to get a precise comfortable fit.  I also use several of the health tracking features (O2, pulse, and ECG) and fit is critical, especially for the O2 function.  So far, this band is working even better than my old silicone band as I can get just the right \"tightness\" for the monitor to work.  The O2 monitor is particularly finicky, and so far, it's working perfectly every time.<br /><br />The bands are colorful, and since I tend to wear black slacks with bright solid jewel-tine tops, they fit my wardrobe, too.  My only reservation on these is durability -- so far, I haven't noticed any problems, but I'm not certain they'll last more than a year or so.  Time will tell.

    "text": "I got this to replace a selfie stick that went missing after my last cruise (I suspect it's buried somewhere in the depths of one of my suitcases, but its location isn't obvious ... ).<br /><br />At first examination, this is a nicely designed selfie stick.  It includes a Bluetooth remote that can be charged via USB cable -- a remote that stores conveniently on the stick itself making it less likely to get lost (I'm notorious for losing things -- see the first paragraph above ... ).  It also includes a built-in tripod that will be useful for stabilizing my iPhone (Product)red (basically a red standard iPhone 8).  Instructions are minimal but this isn't too tricky a device.<br /><br />Following the instructions, I attached the USB charger to the remote, and a red light appeared on the charging cable.  So far, so good.  Then it went out after a few minutes.  OK -- does that mean the remove is now fully charged?  No way to tell except to use it.  Determined that it's not an indication of whether or not the remote is fully charged:  I used the remote to take two test photos, then let it sit overnight.  Attempted to use it the next morning to find that it was depleted (wouldn't pair with my iPhone).  Plugged it in again to charge, left it the entire day, then again used it to snap two photos, left it overnight, and this time, it was still charged the next morning.  When in doubt, charge overnight to ensure you have power for the next day.<br /><br />The second issue came from the directions.  When you use the remote to pair with your phone, there's supposed to be a blue light on the remote that flashes to indicate that Bluetooth is turned on.  And after successful pairing, the blue light is supposed to stay on while paired.  The blue light on my remote never came on, either flashing or steady.  You press the power button on the remote to initiate and disconnect pairing (hold it down for 3 seconds in both cases).  Without the blue indicator light, I used the \"Settings\" on my phone to determine that Bluetooth pairing and disconnect were successful.  This isn't a dealbreaker for me -- but it was an annoyance and I docked one star for this.<br /><br />Once pairing was complete, use of the selfie stick is fairly straightforward.  You put your phone into the holder, follow the instructions (you need to swivel it around 180 degrees), set the angle (untighten/tighten the bolt on the side of the holder), activate your camera app, and you're set to go.  You can leave the remote in its place on the stick and use it as a \"normal\" selfie stick.  Or you can detach the remote and use it with or without the tripod to trip the shutter (make sure your camera app has the volume button set to act as the shutter when the camera app is \"live\" -- I think the app on my iPhone is automatically set for this as I didn't have to change anything to get it to work).  In that respect, it works as advertised -- no issues so far.<br /><br />Overall, I do like this -- I'll be taking it on my next trip (cruise to Hawaii, Tahiti, and French Polynesia) in Mar/April and I'll see how it holds up under the stress of travel and fairly heavy use.  If I encounter any further issues, I'll update this review.",

    "text": "I originally purchased a Mophie Juice Pack Helium several months ago as my first foray into battery/charging cases for my iPhone 5s.  When I was offered this Vysk model, I decided to give it a try, to see which I preferred.<br /><br />Easy answer:  I'm switching to the Vysk EP1.  There's a lot to like about it:<br /><br /> -- \"non-slip\" grip<br />It has a textured back that makes it less likely to slip, and the edges are \"angled\" rather than curved like the Mophie.  The Mophie, although a nice case, was just too slippery compared to the Vysk.<br /><br /> -- It's MUCH easier to install than the Mophie.  I have a \"thin-film\" type screen protector on my iPhone and I didn't have any problem getting the case on the phone smoothly and easily.  I also like that the buttons on the phone actually protrude out of the Vysk case -- just far enough to be useful, but not so far that removing the case is impacted too much.  Because of the design, the earphone jack is recessed so there's a \"dongle\" supplied which allows you to use wired headphones (just like on the Mophie).<br /><br /> -- Recharging the phone from the case is relatively fast (&lt; 2 hrs from 5% to 100% on the phone).<br /><br /> -- I got one full (100%) charge from the case plus about a 50% second charge without recharging the case.<br />I had charged both phone and case to 100%.  Used the phone with the case switch \"off\" until phone got down to 5% charge.  Turned the case to + (on), and charged the phone.  As soon as the phone got to 100%, I turned the case off.  Ran the phone down to 5% again, turned the case on, and got to 58% before the Vysk ran out of power.  That's not too shabby, really.<br /><br />Basically, this unit exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />There are a few things that might be considered negatives:<br /><br /> -- As mentioned above, you have to us a separate \"dongle\" in order to use wired headphones.  That means you have to keep track of that little gizmo, and it might a somewhat inconvenient.  I use Bluetooth headphones and speakers, so it's not an issue for me, but it might be for you.<br /><br /> -- The added security is nice, but the lens cover also covers the camera's flash, which doubles as the flashlight.  With the cover in place, you cannot use the flashlight.  You have to remember to slide the cover over if you need to use the flashlight.  I consider this a minor inconvenience, but others may consider it more troublesome.<br /><br /> -- It does add to the weight of the phone. It is, after all, a battery, so it's going to add some weight.  Again, I don't mind this but others might.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sold on the Vysk EP1 unit.  I wasn't expecting it to be that much better than the Mophie, and they actually both perform well.  But the Vysk has some extras that I like better, so it has my vote.  Solid 4.5 stars (rounded up ... )",

    "text": "I'm always looking for electronic accessories that actually make my life easier.  This is one of those accessories.<br /><br />First, the pros:  it serves double duty: USB --> Lightning or Micro cable; and it's a functional small key ring.  Since I usually keep my car and house keys separate, I tend to use at least 2 key rings, and this could easily serve as one of them, which would give me a usable charging cable 24/7.<br /><br />It's brightly colored, so it's easy to spot in my bag.  It appears to be well made, sturdy, and unless unusually badly handled, it's not likely to rip or tear.  Should last awhile.<br /><br />The lightning attachment fits my iPhone 5S snugly, but not *too* snug -- in other words, it's fairly easy to plug it in.  I have a case on my iPhone, and it fits fine without having to remove the case.<br /><br />It seems to charge relatively quickly on the lightning attachment -- not as fast as the original Apple cable/etc., but would work fine to recharge overnight.  I didn't get an \"incompatible\" message, so my iPhone is happy with it.<br /><br />Cons:  My only quibble with this is the length of the cable.  You release the cable by pushing it through the hippo's \"mouth,\" but even fully extended, you have barely 2\" from USB to hippo and dual-headed lightning/micro to hippo.  This means that you'll need to be careful where you charge -- I have mine charging right now next to my laptop via the USB port on the computer, and it's fine.  I don't see how you could use your device WHILE it's charging -- there's just not enough \"play\" in the cable to allow for that.  Just something to think about.<br /><br />This would make a nice stocking stuffer -- a novelty item that actually serves a useful purpose.

When i was offered a sample to try out and review, I jumped at the opportunity.<br /><br />This case is extremely lightweight, with flexible sides that make inserting the phone easy.  It fits snugly, but all controls are where they should be and easily accessible.  Best of all, it lets the sleek beauty of the iPhone 5S shine through.<br /><br />Yes, I'll probably use other cases occasionally, but this is my new &#34;everyday&#34; case.

    "text": "I recently purchased an iPhone 5S, so I was happy to try out this Zeetron cable when offered the opportunity by the manufacturer.<br /><br />My phone is in a fairly lightweight case -- [[ASIN:B00ESJGJZE AmazonBasics PC/Silicon Case for iPhone 5S & iPhone 5 - Orange / Blue]] -- and the lightning plug just barely fits without removing the case.  If your case is heavier than this one, you'll need to slip it off in order to use the plug.<br /><br />That said, it does precisely what the description says it will do: it glows blue when the USB end is plugged in, then turns red when you attach your device to the lightning end.  It remains red until the device is fully charged, when it turns blue again.  You know immediately the status of the charge just by looking at the light.  I like this feature a lot!<br /><br />I tested this on my iPhone's electrical outlet adapter as well as in the USB port on my laptop, and it works great for both.  For the price shown here, it's really a good deal.<br /><br />I may be getting a couple of these as holiday stocking stuffers for relatives.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/10/14:  I'm using this cable daily, and it's still working just fine.  I gave two of them as holiday gifts, and both recipients say theirs are still working well.  Based on my experience so far, I still give it 5 stars.",

They all perform about the same, the rubber wears out eventually, etc.<br /><br />When I needed to replace yet another one (I tend to lose them), I noticed this set, and figured for the price, it was a fairly good deal.  I liked the longer tethers, since I can keep it \"plugged in\" while using it, so less chance of losing it.  Ordered them, and I'm NOT disappointed at all!<br /><br />The design is slimmer than the ones I've used in the past, and the tip is smaller, too.  I get more precision when using it, which I really like.  You get replacement tips -- that's a nice touch.  I got the aqua/blue/purple color combination, and the colors are fairly close to the photo (maybe a bit lighter).<br /><br />Overall, I'm VERY happy with this purchase.  Definitely would recommend!",

I do not understand.<br /><br />Were there many people requesting a slippery case for their expensive iPhone 6 and/or 6S? (I know I certainly wasn't.)<br /><br />I can think of other materials they could have used that would not have resulted in a slippery case.<br /><br />On a different note: The company goes out of its way here at Amazon to brag how their case is Apple MFi certified. They neglect, however, to mention in advance that in spite of this MFi certification some people can still expect to get the error message on their iPhone that &#34;this accessory might not be supported.&#34; (They do include this fact on the instruction sheet you get with the case.)<br /><br />Sadly, at the current asking price for this case I cannot recommend it to those who do not want a slippery-feeling Qi charging case because of its slippery feel. Hopefully the company will eventually release a second generation case that is not as slippery, for those who prefer that.<br /><br />I do recommend this case for those who do not mind a slippery-feeling Qi charging case.<br /><br />To put your iPhone into this case you pull up very hard (it takes a bit of effort...perhaps too much effort) on the upper piece of the case. Slide your phone into the case and then snap the top back on.<br /><br />I like the fact the case is lightweight. I love the pull-out lightning connector at the bottom so you can insert a lightning cable when you are away from your Qi charging base. I like that the sound curves around the bottom and comes out the front.",

As soon as the factory plastic was peeled off, installation, where I followed the instructions, was immediate.<br /><br />Of course, installation is usually not quite as easy as the video would make you believe. The red pull tab on the Cinder to peel off the cover from the backing broke off immediately, and thus was worthless. This made peeling off the back more difficult, but certainly doable.<br /><br />My Cinder arrived with some kind of small circular imperfection, with a tiny black dot in the center of the circle. I am uploading a picture. I am not sure it is easy to see in the picture, but it is there. It is not a bubble. It is not &#34;hazes&#34; (per the instruction manual). And it is not something that pushes towards the edge using pressure.<br /><br />Besides the very disappointing details above, which made me give this 2 stars which means &#34;I Don't Like It&#34; according to Amazon's ratings system, there are positives about the Cinder: The Cinder feels nice to the touch. The edge to edge looks nice. I was able to line up the Cinder screen cover relatively easy by going slow and being patient upon application. Touch sensitivity seems good.",

They're not meant for SLRs at all. This may have been clear to everyone but me though. After I realized how they weren't going to work for me at all, I scoured Craigslist for a bunch of older Bogen tripods. I spent too much money, but felt good about them. I like finding deals so I paid less than they were worth...but then I found this tripod and realized I had actually wasted a lot of money. The larger, heavier tripods aren't really necessary for what I do. They're great for pros who want to have the biggest, best, and most expensive...which I was, and did, at one point. In my opinion, there's really no need to spend $50-$100 for a used Bogen tripod, or $200+ for a new one. These Ravelli's are sturdy and light weight. The weight is more important that I originally thought too. My students complained about the heavy metal tripods. They wouldn't take them out on their shoots. The Ravelli's are light weight and have the bag...which makes it a lot easier for my students to get out and shoot. Anyways. I really don't think you'll be disappointed with this tripod. I was pleasantly surprised. Frustrated that I spent too much before, but happy that I've found these guys now. Anybody need a used Bogen tripod? :)",

    "text": "Y'all. While the iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 13 pro max are the same size, the raised camera square is different. This is apples way of making sure that when you get the lastest and greatest, you have to purchase a new case. That being said, THIS DOES NOT FIT AN IPHONE 13 PRO MAX. I purchased two cases. This one and one for the iPhone 13 pro max and compared the size of the camera opening. They. Are. Different.<br /><br />Aside from that, the design is cute, though it looks a little sloppier in person that in the photo, and the murkiness makes it so that the color of my phone doesn't really pop against the gold of the detail.",

    "text": "PROS:  The dark heavy rubber or plastic \"bumpers\" and edges on this case are great.  I especially like the snap in flaps for the input/output ports on the bottom.  The back and the front snap together firmly and the case itself feels fairly indestructible.<br /><br />CONS:  The Amazon listing says this is \"Designed for Moto G Stylus 5G.\"  Now, why in the world Poetic would market this without a cut out on the back side to accommodate people who use the fingerprint scanner is beyond me.  Using an X-acto knife I cut out an oval to allow access to the scanner, but I shouldn't have had to do that.  Furthermore the heavy plastic on the back leaves gaping open spaces by not clinging to the surface --a sure attractor of dust and debris ..and moisture, should the phone be dropped in water or splashed.  Secondly, the clear screen protector on the front is little more than a heavy grade Saran-type plastic.  It seems cloudy and doesn't cling to the surface well, leaving MANY bubbles, streaks, etc.  I have friends whose phones are uglier looking than that, but it's more than I can put up with.  There's no way this moderately thick clear plastic could protect a glass surface from cracking or scratching, imho.<br /><br />I'm keeping this case for the time being, but will very likely replace it with an Otterbox and tempered glass in the future.  That video with the Poetic listing is certainly convincing, with the phone bouncing down steps, etc.  But be advised.",

I had been using a wonderful Caseology protective case on my Note 4, but didn't find one for the new Moto, so I chose this Spigen case.  It fits about the same, leaves plenty of access room for cameras and fingerprint authentication, etc.  I also like the fact that there's a small lip on the Spigen so that, if I put the Moto down screen down, the case keeps the screen from touching the surface I placed it upon.  The only thing I kind of dislike about it is that, rather than the slightly softer, grippy feel of my old case, this Spigen feels a bit more like XXX fine sandpaper.  Which is okay, except that, since the Moto is slightly heavier than my old Samsung, the grip feels a little less secure, and I have a feeling the Spigen will attract a lot more fine dust to its surface.

It was either this, or buy a new phone since the charging circuit in my phone died (though the phone itself still worked). I dropped it one too many times, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, once you figure out how this works, it's very easy. You simply align the prongs to the + and - terminals on your battery and bam! it can read your battery's power level. The LCD screen is nothing special, but it's very functional, and I've found it to be pretty accurate.<br /><br />I had to snap off the plastic on the far side so my large battery could fit, but that's no big deal. I use 2 rubber bands to hold the battery in place. The whole kit works very well. I'll be buying a backup.<br /><br />I only charge it when I'm sitting in the same room, but so far it hasn't caused the battery to explode :P.",

    "text": "I have had the pan for about 5 months now. I find that it takes a noticeable time to heat up and once it does the cooking surface becomes convex and all the liquids float to the edges. There is a definite hot spot in the center that will actually burn anything that touches the area requiring careful attention while your cooking. If the handles are too close to the heating element or flame they get very hot! Be careful! Just a few minor scratches in the coating so far. Yes, easy clean up of most everything I cook in it. I always use plastic or rubber utensils with it and rarely need to wash it with other than a soft sponge. I also never heated it on \"High\" and most always cooked at medium heat. Because of the handles and the convex cooking surface when hot I would not buy this again. I chose this in favor of a more expensive heavier pan with lid that probably had one maybe two more coatings of the non-stick surface on it. Most of these pans last about 2-3 years before their scratches make them unhealthy to cook in anymore. It's just a fact of non-stick cookware. In general non-stick cookware  prices vary by thickness and type of metal and how many coatings are on it. There can be as little as 2 and as much as 5 coatings but unfortunately that doesn't really extend the life of the surface very much. A more expensive pan would be less likely to warp, probably heat more evenly and the handle or handles would remain cool. My last large pan like this was made in Sweden. It was much heavier and cooked very well but the surface only lasted about 3-4 years even with the best of care. It seems it's the nature of the beast.",

It will NOT allow cordless charging from another power source because the metal case isn't compatible with cordless charging. There are 10 micro screws that you screw into the case after assembling it to your phone so its as sturdy as can be.If you drop your phone it will be protected pretty well,but if you need to remove your phone from the case you have to use the special tool it came with to un-screw all 10 screws.

It can be charged up from the sun,or a wall socket. It has wireless charging so you can charge a device without a cord as well. It is a bit heavier than others,but that's because it's made from durable materials.

This is my first smart phone and I'm not all that interested in surfing or email, having a ton of apps, or even texting.  I use a phone for making and getting calls and so far this one has been perfect.<br /><br />The screen is bright, responsive and quick, the size, smaller than an iphone or galaxy, bigger than most non-smart phones is just right.  It's easy to see and hold yet isn't so big it doesn't fit well in a pocket.  The battery life is good. I haven't timed the battery life but it's good for at least 5 days on standby, probably more.  Talking on it is the best part.  It sounds great.  Voices are clear and I've never had someone on the other end mention problems hearing me.<br /><br />I count this phone as the best phone I've ever had. I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Update: Six months later and I still love it. But I've realized that with a touch screen I can't feel my way to the right button.",

I have dropped mine and had the back pop off and it come apart and yet, I snap it back together and it works like a charm.<br /><br />You can personalize it much better than the older phones<br /><br />I love the blue icon grid (used to just have green and orange and now has green and blue and the blue is AWESOME)<br /><br />Holds quite a few pictures, videos and songs<br /><br />You can customize the front grid so whatever you want is on there<br /><br />I actually like the Qwerty keyboard. I am a big fan of those and they work very well for me. I know some people hate them but I am not one of them<br /><br />Holds a charge for quite a long time<br /><br />Sets multiple alarms (my last phone didn't do that but it was pretty old)<br /><br />Great music sound<br /><br />The loud ring is really loud and the vibrate is pretty strong so you do feel it<br /><br />The notepad feature is pretty good. I use it a lot for my grocery list<br /><br />I love the fact that you can set world times so that all you have to do is click the icon and it will take you to the time of the city you are looking for. I have friends or relatives in several cities around the world and I find myself using this more than I thought I would.<br /><br />CONS<br />It is not as \"cool\" as the iPhone<br /><br />It is easy to punch a button by accident (like your voicemail)and that is super annoying<br /><br />The videos have to be put into another format to play on the Brightside and its a little annoying to put them on<br /><br />The bluetooth settings are not very good and its very hard to get it to be compatible<br /><br />It needs more fonts and needs a larger font for people who have difficulty seeing. The large font is not very large and the normal font is tiny<br /><br />You cannot set the phone so that it locks after a few minutes. This was a great safety feature on other phones and this phone does not have it and I don't know why. If it is stolen, it can be used by the thief. The security features on the iPhone are much better than this phone and the older flip phones were much better than this phone.<br /><br />The camera is awful. The pictures are dark and grainy. I have used it but it really is awful.<br /><br />It only has two languages, English and Spanish. If you wanted Russian, Hebrew, Yiddish, Chinese etc....don't go with this phone, go with another phone.<br /><br />Very hard to use it with voice prompts but it says it has those. It may be that bluetooth is very hard to set up and that is why.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />All in all. I am happy with it but in a few years when only smartphones are offered, I will have to bite the bullet and I will get an iPhone and get one and I know it will be better than this one but for now, this one is ok and as I share a service plan...I only pay $15 a month and rarely go over my minutes.",

I have it right now at a 45 degree and going upwards to my phone.<br /><br />The other stand's base was junk - any time I moved the arm the base slid around and I ended up duct taping the base. This stand stays right where I put it, even when I adjust the arm.<br /><br />I like that this stand has a clip for the phone holder (my other one did too - that's what broke though). I'm always putting my phone in and taking it out do do something, and it's so easy with a clip compared to other stands that you have to tighten or loosen a piece around your phone.<br /><br />The colors on this stand are lovely and the build quality is good.

The clip that holds the phone is on a ball joint and easy to move around, also holds well where you position it.<br /><br />A con is the base clip is weak and slides around easily which makes the whole thing tip over in certain positions, especially if the arm goes off to the side. Clip is definitely strong enough to hold it when aligned better though, but it seems like the clip might break eventually if you adjust the arm by cranking against the base. I hold the bottom of the arm when making big adjustments to the arm or else the clip slides all over or pops off. I've got a metal wood clamp with a spring and I'll probably try to anchor it with that.<br /><br />The only other con is the clamp can press the side buttons on my phone if I'm not careful - there's no way around it because of how the clip works. It was frustrating at first but solved by being a little more careful so no big.",

If you take time to adjust them the obstruction is not too bad and workable, but just thought I would point that out.<br /><br /> The other thing I can't stand is that it's not compatible with wireless chargers.  You will have to take it out of the sling in order to use the wireless chargers or else your back to plugging your phone in.<br /><br />  Would like option to remove phone from arm band.<br /><br />  Would be nice if they had an integrated wireless charger.<br /><br /> Would be nice if they had some sort of flip up hard  top cover like the Preditor had in order to keep it from being banged up if you are out hiking through rough brush or a forrest or as a sun shade of a sort.",

I must say that at least initially, I'm impressed with the attention to detail made in creating this product and the installation process.  I've never had a screen protector this complicated to install, but if you take your time, it seems like the results are definitely worth it.  They really thought through everything thoroughly, from the bubble level to the weight that goes over the fingerprint sensor.  My protector looks smooth as glass, and the fingerprint sensor seems to work fine, although I was initially worried that no amount of pressure would get it to read (turns out you're better off not trying to press your entire fingerprint on the screen when registering it).<br /><br />The plastic film that comes pre-installed on the S10 was starting to look like crap on my device (sort of defeats the purpose of having a gorilla glass screen when you have a very easily scratched plastic protector on there).  Time will tell how this holds up, but my previous experience with glass protectors saving my actual screen from near-certain scratches has been good.  I expect this to be the same but will update my review if I find otherwise.  I'm just really glad they figured out a way to add a protector to a curved screen without having to use cheap plastic film.",

However, I was very careful with the installation, so if it was off the mark it was only off slightly to the point that the product did still function.  At the end of the day there is a better alternative available...just buy a different battery cover for your phone that has the wireless charging already included.  You can find them for only a few bucks more than this sticker (I think mine was about $9), you don't have to install it yourself, you know it will work and it won't heat up your phone to ridiculous levels that might cause long term damage!

These have an almost rubberized coating which provides a nicer grippier feel.  They fit surpisingly well and seem quite secure. Perfect fit for this phone. Two pieces, one for the front and one for the back. Holes for camera, ringer and LED outside display. Makes the phone only slightly thicker, but not at all in an objectional way. Feels a lot better with the added thickness. I have these on and use a pouch style case and it fits fine, better than without them on.",

I tend to have relatively dry hands too so often it takes multiple attempts to make a selection.<br /><br />The stylus solves all those problems. Plus it keeps your screen free of finger prints. When I first got it I was a bit skeptical of its soft mesh tip. I questioned the durability, but it has proved to be just fine and there is no way to get a scratch or smudge from it. Nice size and metal construction. Very high quality. I don't use the little attachments. It has a nice pocket clip and fit nicely in my tablet case/cover's little stylus keeper.<br /><br />A very useful, inexpensive accesory for a great tablet.",

Completely unusable. Original Review :  I like how easy this was to apply.  (My last product actually cracked WHILE I was applying it!)  There are a few issues with it, however:  1) The instructions are written in really tiny print on the box, so I actually had to use a magnifying glass to read them!  2) There is no cutout for the front camera lens.  This didn't appear to affect the \"selfie\" function, however, so probably not a big issue if you make sure it is adhered well over the lens. 3) Most importantly, it does not register your fingerprint once installed on your phone screen.  (I didn't try to do this first, however, so maybe it would work that way, but I don't think it would.)  I personally don't use the biometric function on my phone because I don't like being forced to have a screen lock, so the lack of fingerprint capability doesn't matter to me.  If you do use a fingerprint unlock, I don't recommend this screen.  For me, however, it's just fine. Hopefully it actually protects the phone, since I do drop it occasionally, but I can't speak to that issue yet, since I just installed it.  Hope this info is helpful!",

However, because the phone it was bought for (Galaxy Note 20 Ultra) has a unique CURVED screen, Poetic did not include a built-in screen protector into the design of this particular case.  Not only that, the frame that surrounds the screen is not as protective (more like cheap plastic) than we have on all of our other Poetic cases. Because of this, there really should be a raised bumper around all four sides of the phone in the event the phone is dropped face down, but there is only a slightly raised bumper at the top and the bottom.  I still love Poetic cases, but am really nervous about this one, since I drop my phone fairly frequently - - a habit I've allowed in the past in large part because of how well my other Poetic phone cases have worked.

    "text": "I bought this phone SOLELY because it's the only newer phone that still has a micro-SD card slot for extra storage.  I had also had a Note 3 which lasted 17 years before we eventually retired it. (That'll NEVER happen with newer phones that are made to have to be replaced after a couple of years!). Now for a few of the reasons you should NOT get this phone:  1) THE BATTERY LIFE IS HORRENDOUS!  If you use your phone a lot, or use it for streaming or gaming, plan on having to charge it several times a day.  I actually use my phone very little compared to a lot of other people, I have it on extreme battery saver with most of my apps restricted from running in the background, and I STILL have to charge at least once a day, even though the settings tell me that I have 2.2 days of charge left.  2) AMAZON WILL NOT HONOR THEIR PREMIUM RENEWED COMMITMENT OF ONE YEAR REPLACEMENT OR REFUND--as stated clearly on the product description page!  In fact, they stated that they wouldn't even allow the 90 days that are given for lesser renewed products, only the same window for Christmas returns, which is less than 2 months!  3). It is nearly impossible to find a phone case with a built-in screen protector because of the unique CURVED screen on the phone, and the ones that are available don't work with the fingerprint reader.  Therefore, if you regularly drop your phone like I do, PLAN ON HAVING TO REPLACE YOUR PHONE ENTIRELY.  Very disappointed in this phone AND in Amazon!",

I ended up having to Google how to get tempered glass off a phone screen, and eventually got the glass off the camera.

Seems to charge like the stock charger.<br /><br />I'll update if these crap out, but so far so good! yay!",

Phew!<br /><br />I had another of exact same style [[ASIN:B09J241J3F from a different brand]]. I was simply in the mood for something new. My old one was light pink and was beginning to look a bit too dirty. I didn't want pink again, and the only other options that company had were black or brown. Not against either, but I prefer something more colorful. I then found this Balleen.E Phone Case in Teal, and decided to try it out. Everything else about it appeared the same. I was keen on the same layout, and this had it.<br /><br />So far so good. Seems durable, has good zipper, strong magnet. Holds cards well. Goo stitching, nice look and feel. Zipper portion is outer most area, then section with 8 card slots, 1 with clear window, then the side facing the phone has 3 additional slots along with a pocket (I slip notes or coupons in). As with the other, I wish I could just fold my money in half and slip it in, but it is not long enough nor wide enough for that. I have to fold it in thirds. I dont carry much cash, so it isnt a big deal.<br /><br />4.5 stars",

The additional ear support is nice. A better fit reduces ear pain and fatigue. And of course helps hold it in place. I dont often need to be on the phone, and I dont typically want anything IN my ear, but there are some circumstances that I want a hands free, one ear free device to allow me to make and take calls, and to listen to other stuff. I didnt want to spend much (or wouldnt want to), so looking at the sub $35 price range was important. This is currently $30, so it fits what I am looking for.<br /><br />This has no noticeable interference or excess noise. I can hear well, and person on other end could hear me. Was nice using it while out for a walk as I didnt have to hold my phone, and wind and such didnt impede hearing.<br /><br />I love that the storage case is the charging case too. I know it isnt new idea, but only recently have I acquired items that have that. I just plug into a wall adapter, and it charges up quickly enough. Seems to hold a charge for a looooooog time. I havent had it run out of charge, and even better, it seems to hold charge even in stand by for a long time.<br /><br />I think this is worth the try.

    "text": "So far, so good. Good fit for my Google Pixel 6 Pro. Cut outs are well aligned, and the frame holds my phone securely (so far). I might consider another color. Read on for more details, and concerns.<br /><br />I chose this phone wallet because I prefer a wallet style holder. I like having my phone entirely covered up. I can toss it in a bag and not worry about it. I like just grabbing the phone, via wrist strap and do my shopping without carrying a purse.<br /><br />I just carry a couple of cards and some paper. When I saw that some cases have a zipper section, I was intrigued. I looked at several styles before settling on this one. What ultimately made me choose it? The zipper portion being on the outer portion of the phone case. I was worried that the zipper pull would touch the phone or the sides, and create possible scratches or get caught while trying to close the case. Or even just interfere in other ways I hadn't yet considered. Other phone cases have the zipper portion inside, close to the phone. I didn't like that. This one is on outside. I like that.<br /><br />Next, there are card slots that dont touch the screen. There are also some card slots that do, but there is an OPTION to just use the sets that dont touch the screen. And that portion snaps closed. It isnt just flailing open while my phone is in use. I like that-- added security. My last phone case when open, meant that the cards were exposed. Also, I had slots that touched the screen, and the cards made little scratches over time on the screen, and then once I put a screen protector on, scratches on the protector. SO this has 7 card slots that do not touch the screen at all. Then there is a panel of 3 slots that do. I dont need every slot filled, so I know I could keep the slots that are against the screen clear.<br /><br />Basically goes like this: Magnetic closer strap, zipper portion, then 7 slot card area that has snap closure, then on opposite side has 3 card slots and a pocket, then the phone area. Includes a wrist strap.<br /><br />The zipper area is spacious, but not too big, bulky. I would rather it was deep enough to be able to fold my cash in half and slide in, but that is not possible. I have to fold it further to get it in place. Just needed to be a couple millimeters wider and it would work. Oh well. There is a pocket on the slot side that touches the phone where I can simply fold the cash in half and slide it in. I like the added carrying space.<br /><br />Going back to the slots. The slot that has the clear window, also has the snap closure rivet. Be mindful of what you place there because for some reason, it makes for an extra tight fit, and it slights scrubs against what you put there. I decided to only put a credit card or ID if I have it in a paper protective sleeve. I dont want anything scratched up. Other side has the other rivet, but doesn't seem to rub anything I put there.<br /><br />Overall I like it, am pleased with it. Could be a little better in ways, but still has all that I am looking for. Adds minor bulk compared to other cases, but it suits my needs just fine. I do feel secure with it, and that is most important. Might buy another in a different color.",

Written instructions worked out best, but I did accidentally ruin the first one because the peel back slipped. Once I tried again, all went very well. I have been using stuff like this for years, and always get it on the first try perfectly. This one threw me off a little. Just watch video on this page a few times, read directions, have patience, then have at it.<br /><br />LOVE the plug in \"guide\" and the added no slip backing (like a carpet backing) to help out this process. Plenty of wet wipes, dust wipes, dust pick up tape. Overall, a really good kit.<br /><br />I happened to order this knowing my phone was on the way. Once my phone arrived, I didnt touch it until I had this ready to use. It saved me greatly from having to clean the screen off as it comes comes covered up.<br /><br />Hopefully it does what it is supposed to do and keep my phone screen safe.

I prefer the regular silicone watch bands for working out, and other high activity days. But for a comfy, attractive, barely there feel especially when going out for dinner or running errands? The elastic style are a must have. They do loosen up over course of day, but are easy enough to tighten back up.<br /><br />This two pack has a textured black elastic band, as well a textured pale pink (\"rose pink\") elastic band.  The clip system on the Sense (and Versa 3) is so easy, and these are easy to clip in and take off. Easy to change up looks anytime I want.

    "text": "5 stars. I had purchased another brand and loved them, and eventually I wanted more but in different colors. I figured I loved my other ones so I should love these as well. They go on easily, comes off easily as needed, are bright shiny attractive colors, work really well as a bumper and screen protector, and are budget friendly.<br /><br />First, what I like:<br />--I like the variety of colors available. Adds a little pop of color against my basic black band (or added pop of color to my colorful bands)<br />--Easy on, easy off. The covers are flexible and simply pop on, or pull off when you want to change it out or when you need to charge your VERSA 2. These need to come off when charging as stated in the product description.<br />--I can use buttons and touch screen no problem, no different than without the protector on.<br />--No scratching or rubbing from this YAY<br />--provides some protection to screen and sides. When I first tried my Versa 2 (a christmas gift 2019), I noticed that I would easily bang into things, even more so than the Blaze I had prior. I immediately set out to find a screen protector and was very happy to find these bumpers- it was basically exactly what I was looking for- protection on screen AND sides!<br /><br />What I do not like (minimal, but worth mentioning):<br />--having to take off before charging, but since it is so easy to take off and put on, it really isn't a problem for me.<br />--*potential to fall off.  It is a rare thing, and isn't enough of a problem to keep me from using these. I figure I would rather this get banged than the edges of my Versa2 get hit. The protectors will eventually loosen up a little, and that it when there is a potential to fall off when it gets caught on something. Truly minimal issue.<br /><br />I have the four pack that contains Rose Gold/Jade Green/Purple/Red. I am currently using the \"jade green\" which I call turquoise. Looks great with a colorful band that has a little of that color in it.<br /><br />Currently comfortable with full rating. However, I am an avid reviewer, and will absolutely come back if I learn anything new or discover something worth sharing about these- good or bad. So far so good, and I hope I continue to be highly pleased with them. I think they are worth giving a try!",

My reader pretty much lives on my nightstand. Swapping out my usual charger for this colorful charging cable has been great. It noticed that my device seemed to charge rather quickly. I didn't keep track of time, but it went from 37% to nearly full quicker than I expected. Maybe I was imagining it?<br /><br />What I really like about this cord is the color. It seems like a silly thing, but it has been nice to actually see the cord in a dark corner. It is so easy to see compared to all my other dark colored cords. I didn't think it would make that much of a difference until I went to find which cord went to what among the tangle on the floor.  3 feet length is fine, but I am considering looking for a longer length cord if they have one.<br /><br />Looks just like in pictures. Is a nylon braided cord with grippy ends.<br /><br />No complaints or issues thus far. Very pleased!",

    "text": "This is the second Cluvox Rapid Type C car charger I have owned, and like the first (still going strong several months later) this one as good as expected. There are three items in the small box. I recommend keeping the box for storage for when not in use. It has the dual port car charger that you plug into the cigarette lighter (or whatever they are called now a days), a USB C to USB C cord plus a USB C to USB cord. That is is. This item is meant for use with phones and devices that have a USB C charging port. If you have another cord- say a USB micro to USB, then it could work, but it likely won't have the rapid charge effect.<br /><br />For QUICK CHARGE: Make sure to use the USB C to USB cord if you want to QUICK CHARGE your phone. The port you want to plug into on the car charger takes the regular USB. This port is labeled QC 3.0.<br /><br />For STANDARD CHARGE: Use the USB C to USB C cord. This will charge at a regular rate. This port is labeled, PD.<br /><br />I about never drive at night, but the charger does have a low blue glow. I had tried it out to be able to say that it isn't distracting. My charge port is way below eye level though, so that may make a difference.<br /><br />I have no issues with this product, it so far has worked as needed for both my Pixel3xl and 4xl<br /><br />If I experience anything else worth mentioning, I will be back to do so. In the meantime, given my experience with two Cluvox product, I would recommend these chargers.",

There is nothing to them- super light and small (fits in palm of my hand!) and so you may think that they just wont be sturdy enough, but I am able to prop up my smartphone or my large table without issue.

There are rubbery grips on four corners underside, and one grip strip where device rests. I have a larger, heavy (and more expensive) style for when I know I will be doing a lot of tapping/applying pressure, but this style is holding steady when I use it. Overall I consider these light weight ones good for light use- just want to phone or tablet propped up hands free.<br /><br />Price for 2 is ok, price per unit is better on the larger quantity/multi packs.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a basic, slim, ultra lightweight, grippy, inexpensive phone/tablet holder then this product should be adequate.

    "text": "I pretty much only use wallet cases like these- more protection than just a holder. I had an expensive wallet case for my 3XL, and seems they don't have one yet for the 4XL. I needed something in the meantime, so I took a chance on ordering this case. I must say, the color is outstanding. It is a deep, gorgeous purple. On my end, darker than what is pictured. Clearly purple, but almost a black purple, if that makes sense. I also love the design on the front cover and magnetic closure tab. The rear is plain yet also attractive. The optional strap that comes with it seems sturdy enough. I have it attached though I don't often find myself using it. I like that I can take it off if I find it irksome.<br /><br />The interior has 3 slots for bank cards (or whatever) as well as a longer slot for paper money. As with every wallet case I have ever had, the opening isn't long enough to just slide money into. I always have to fold it. Not a problem as I usually just carry a little extra cash, and leave my wads of money (lol) for my actual wallet.<br /><br />The magnetic closure is sturdy and solid. It grabs the case and keeps it closed. Easy to open as needed.<br /><br />Built in kick stand is basically just allowing the phone to rest horizontally on the inside cover. It works.<br /><br />I am so impressed by the color that I want the other two colors as well, just to swap out.<br /><br />The cut-out around the rear camera is perfect. Zero issues. No haziness or other obstruction.<br /><br />If you are a fan of wallet style phone cases AND use it to hold bank card in the slots, then you should also get a screen protector. I say this because on my 3XL with another wallet case, the cards began to etch the screen. I don't think it is a matter of the brand of wallet or the quality, just the reality of a hard card hitting the screen over and over. So I made sure to buy a screen protector this time around. Now if there is any scratching, it will be on the protector and not the actual phone.<br /><br />For what it is worth, I like the wallet style not so much for the wallet part, but that it adds an extra level of protection that a non wallet/cover style case offers. I just prefer to have my phone covered from all sides. The interior of the case has the part that holds onto the phone, and it does so well. But I like the wallet aspect too. I tend to just go into the store with my phone rather than bring in a purse. So... No complaints!<br /><br />No complaints whatsoever. :)<br />If I have any, I iwll be back to update<br /><br />Truly, thanks for making a nice looking, budget friendly, functional case.",

    "text": "FANTASTIC (so far). I bought a flip cover wallet case for my new Google Pixel 4XL, and my experience with my 3XL and a wallet case is that the bank cards were etching the screen. Not wanting to repeat that mistake, I made a point to purchase the screen protector that I could put on the moment the phone arrived.<br /><br />The protector went on easily. Since I put it on as soon as the phone arrived, the screen hadn't any opportunity to get smudge marks or fibers on it, so I didn't need the accompanying tools to help with that. I simply eyeballed the screen protector over the screen, and let it drop gently into place. I nailed it in terms of setting it on perfectly, and I didn't have to fuss. Any bubbles that presented once I pressed down were easily pressed out.<br /><br />Prior to buying this set of screen protectors, I had asked the question to the community (or company) whether or not the material creates a haze around the front facing camera lens. No answer, but now I can answer in case anyone is wondering. See, with my 3XL any tempered glass protectors were too thick around the lens. It created a hazy halo with the front facing camera (selfies, I guess). The way the old phones were set up, the protectors had a cut out around the lens.  The cut outs were weird because the top portion of the layout on the phone was weird. They fixed that with the 4xl. Anyway, the cut outs were barely any bigger than the lens. I am a master at lining up protectors, so it wasn't a matter of failed placement, it was more a matter of design on the 3xl along with the thickness of the protector. I wanted to avoid that going forward- ie; not bother to buy the protector if it was just going to be like that again, but I went ahead and ordered it as I waited for my phone to arrive.<br /><br />Forward to everything arriving and setting everything up. The protectors fit fine, easy to put on, the protector does not surround the camera eye, so there is no risk of creating a haze (unless maybe you put it on wrong). SO much better!!<br /><br />It is still early on for use of this screen protector. I will be back to update if I find that it isn't working out the way it should.",

I can charge and be able to still play on my phone while laying in bed, comfortably.<br /><br />It is a nice looking cord, it looks and feels like quality. I haven't any issues thus far. I have used it with a wall charger, I have used it in a wall receptacle that has USB port, I have used it plugged into my computer. I will likely keep it in my bedroom, and get another for use at my computer. I like having the extra length to my cord as sometimes I take pics while it is plugged in. Say, I have taken pics for review purpose, then while transferring pics to computer I think of other pics I want to take. I can keep it all connected- take more pics- and be able to easily transfer my pics without taking additional steps. It is a little thing, but a big thing in terms of time saving. Of course, I could just take all the pics I need before connecting phone to computer, but that doesn't always happen.

    "text": "Not bad, but not the best.<br /><br />First I will describe the product, then let you know how it can all go wrong.<br /><br />Easy to put together. Comes with directions, don't really need them.<br /><br />This is basically a lamp with a cellphone holder. The lamp is a ring with three settings: \"white, warm yellow, warm yellow + white\".  You can adjust the brightness level for any of those modes. The lamp ring can be manipulated in a few different directions. The lamp gets it power from USB only. The cord of the lamp runs freely out from back of ring, and is approximately 65\" long. There is a switch to turn it on (and adjust lamp mode and brightness) located about half way down the length (between 24\"-27\" from lamp ring). The switch has 4 settings. \"Up\" & \"Down\" switches to change brightness levels, an \"on/off\" switch, and a \"mode\" switch to change between (white), (warm yellow), (warm yellow + white).<br /><br />The base of the stand has three sturdy legs that spread out fairly flat. When not in use, they can be arranged to be all folded tight together, and used supposedly as an awkward handle for self stick. The entire stand itself at full height is approximately 47\". My measurements are not exact, and I have the lamp ring in full upright position. The stand can be adjusted just by turning the tubes/poles- they drop down some as they are loosened. You can collapse all of them to create a very short table top lamp, or they can all be extended to create medium-tall lamp.<br /><br />This last part is actually what makes me kinda not like this unit. By adjusting one, it is way too easy to accidentally adjust another, so while you may want to make a section taller, but the whole thing collapses too short. You try to make it right again, and things move. All these parts do this. It is not a simple adjustment unless you get it just right, and don't move anything else. So that is annoying. Even by just moving the lamp ring, you can easily put enough pressure to loosen up one of the tubes, once again collapsing the pole and making it shorter. Same deal with the cellphone holder. There are too many moving parts and not designed to be sturdy enough to handle these adjustments without impacting the other. As a photographer and avid reviewer, I need to be able to make quick adjustments without much time or hassle. If you just need a light, or just need to adjust once in awhile--and have patience- then this will be fine for that use; pretty good really!<br /><br />Ok, now the cellphone holder. I like the tension holder. It is solid on one end, and has a sliding tension bracket with silicone grip. Not bad. It holds my Google Pixel 3xl just fine (once I take it out of case). BUT the weight of it can pull the holder down, and while the holder itself seems to do a fine job, the spot where the holder attaches to the stand is not latched on enough to to securely hold the weight, or be able to handle adjustments, or tap it for pics, etc. See,  the spot that holds the cellphone holder arm (rugged material, about 8\") to the pole of the stand is a vice style clamp. However, the poles are smooth, and while the vice parts have some traction on each side, it is not enough to firmly hold the cellphone holder in place firmly; it drags it down some. I've tried it on the pole with widest diameter down to smallest- all of them make me question its ability to stay in place. I don't know about you, but this makes me queasy to trust it to keep my expensive cellphone safe from drops.<br /><br />THAT, and if you try to make adjustment to that area, the whole thing can start collapsing on itself (see prior paragraph).<br /><br />So yeh, I love the idea of this equipment. It is something I want and need in my life- but I get frustrated with it. I will continue to use it as intended as I still need to use something. If I come up with any ideas how to deal with some of the short comings, i will share my thoughts. I will say that the overall quality of every part seem good. I am impressed with that!<br /><br />My reduction in rating is based primarily on the cellphone holder arm staying in place. Even with everything else perfectly adjusted, and behaving perfectly (I am generously considering user error), the arm of the cellphone holder dips significantly, and therefore impeded my ability to do my job/tasks.",

Independently we each thought the SnakeHive was the best contender of the bunch. I have used cheap phone cases in the past with success. This is not cheap, but it is still affordable for the quality. When selecting a phone case, it really comes down to what exactly you are looking for, and as for reviewing, if it met those needs.<br />--My husband wanted a folio style case as well as one that worked with the Google wireless charger. I wanted a folio style case, didn't care about the wireless charging, but definitely wanted 2-3 slots for my banking cards. He purchased the black, and I, wanting some color went with the Honey Gold.<br />--It is probably my computer, but I imagined the Honey to be more yellow. This isn't a negative, just wasn't quite what I thought. It is however, truly a Honey Gold (so the naming of the color is spot on). Reminds me of honey mustard sauce. --Soft, newbuck leather. It definitely has a soft feel, and as with any new leather, it will break in over time- both in flexibility and the surface patina. Real leather will absorb oils (from fingers) and absorb other elements of the environment. This is what gives the leather character. Expect your phone case to exhibit these changes over time.; especially a sheen around edges and magnetic clasp. Some people may decide on some additional leather care products.<br />--The stitching is solid and even.<br />--The magnetic clasp is strong, and accommodates additional thickness from use of card and money slots.<br />--3 horizontal card slots, with a full vertical opening to stash cash or receipts.<br />--Cut outs are perfect. The cut outs do not interfere with anything, including back facing camera (I had purchased a screen cover that while the cutouts were good, and the placement was perfect, it created a haze on the resulting picture. This case does not create that effect. It is well done!!)<br />--It doesn't have a special viewing stand, but due to slight fold in rear part of case, it acts as one simply by putting phone into horizontal position.<br />--This case WORKS with wireless charging units, both the Google Pixel wireless charging unit as well as some cheapies purchased on the side.<br />--I have yet to drop my phone, but so far it seems pretty secure in the case, including the rubberized phone holder - it feels secure, and meets up directly with surface of phone.<br />-- My husband does not care for the magnetic clasp. He has to be in and out of his phone many times throughout the day at work, and does not care to have to use two hands basically to get into it, without it feeling clunky. It can be done, but he found that he prefers the feel of a non clasp case, and has since found something else he likes (now I own a black case and my Honey gold case).<br />--I find that the security that the magnetic clasp adds to the safety of the phone (and bank cards, etc) is a great feature. For all the time I spend on my phone (which is a lot, as I definitely use social media and spend time writing reviews), I don't find it too intrusive. I have found it helpful at times when I have been in an odd position trying to get a selfie (usually when trying to get one with one of my dogs or cats), and have used the clasp as stability for my fingers. I guess this is preference thing.<br />In summation, I really see no complaints worthy of down rating this product. It appears to be as described, with the ability to protect the product and be functional. It works with wireless charger, which many of the cases for the Pixel 3 XL do not, or are far and few in between at time of searching for a phone case. Other aspects are simply a matter of preference.<br /><br />Edit 10/2019: Added pics of case that I just took. Also wanted to add that I have dropped phone many times, this case has kept my phone safe. Case color definitely deepens over time, great addition of character. It is a deep caramel brown now. If you use it to store credit cards in the slits, be sure to have a screen shield, or risk scratching phone screen. Other than that, it's holding up well!",

    "text": "EDIT: Well I put this screen protector on same day I got my Pixel 3 XL, and followed up with a review. I had it at 5 stars.  I had written that I would be back to edit if there were any issues. I'm back. The issue is that the holes on the  front facing lense create a halo that is evident when taking a \"selfie\". I thought it was something in my camera settings when it occurred to me that it could be the protector. I hated taking it off to check, but that was it. It isn't a matter of alignment as I couldn't get it any more perfect. I had given my husband one to use, and asked him about what I saw. When testing his camera in selfie mode, sure enough there was a haze there too. Bummer! I thought it a nice protector. My husband said his about came off when he hit it on something. So that's disturbing. So either cut outs needs to be bigger, or material around that section thinner, as the thickness is getting picked up by camera. I'm sorry to have to drop rating from original 5 stars to 2. If I never used the front facing camera, that would be one thing, but since I do, I do not want the end result with a significant haze around the picture. Right now it is worthless to me, unfortunately.  All other info in my review stays the same.<br /><br />No complaints or issues so far. Easy, perfect fit. Nice material, feels like it will protect my Google Pixel 3xl from scratches. I can navigate without hindrance from the protector material. Fair budget friendly price. Came with a link to video instructions. I did not view that prior to installation. As soon as I took my brand new Pixel out of the box I put this protector on before any dust or smudges occurred. Everything lines up perfectly. The box came with 3 protectors, some dust and cleansing wipes, a guard frame as well as guides and a tool to smooth out trapped air. I have only had it a couple of days so i will return to adjust review as needed.",

Feels secure, I've never worried about my Blaze slipping out. Band buckle is secure too.<br /><br />However.. CONS:<br />Color wears off. Ive had two designs from this company. I don't switch them out every day, but instead wear them day in and day out for several weeks. One had a black background with silver. The silver wore away in spots, leaving me with noticeable black areas. Looks shabby now. I gave it a pass and bought another design, the one I am reviewing now. This design that I am reviewing in particular is a white base with the additional colors on top (pink, green, black). So when those colors began to wear away, the white showed through. Again, making it look shabby.<br /><br />Additionally, and the WORST part of it, is that it didn't take much for the band to rip. Now this made me angry. That could have been the loss of an expensive piece of technology.  It tore right across the band. That was it for me.<br /><br />Too bad the cons outweighed the pros. I really wanted to like this product. I love all the cute designs and overall ease of swapping out. But when that band ripped, and of course with each one having their colors wear away.. meh.",

    "text": "I bought this wallet nearly two years ago. I use it every day. There hasn't been another wallet that has caught my attention, nor have I needed another one as this one had been near perfect for the entire time I have been using it. It is a sturdy, well constructed wallet that holds more than it needs to and feels secure to use. Cleans easily. Zippers stay shut, the card holders are deep enough to hold cards. The wallet is wide enough to carry cash and checks without folding them. I love the internal coin zip pocket. I can stick a pen, lip gloss, pack of sticky notes, and a few other slim doo-dads in center zipped area. Despite it having the ability to hold a lot of little extras, it is not bulky. At all. I can stick my cell phone in there so long as it doesn't have a thick case (which is why I originally ordered it so many moons ago). Wristlet is secure.<br /><br /> I'm reviewing it now because I am interested in buying a wallet that has a cross body strap. I don't want to use it in that way every time, but occasionally I want to just take my wallet into a store and not an entire purse. But want to emphasize that the wristlet on this wallet is very well made and super sturdy, and works well enough for semi hands free shopping/errand running. Nothing on this wallet has ever made me question the integrity of the materials. It is solid!<br /><br />However, now that I am looking for one with a cross body strap, I am sad to move out of this wallet and into something else. So now I am looking at the exact same company (Belfen/Befen) for something that will be similar to this wallet and yet have a cross body strap. Way to go Belfen/Befen for making something of quality that has made me want to purchase from you again. Hope my next one is as good as this one.",

I HAD a retro cordless/blue-tooth style, but it is a pain to keep charged, remember to have it connected, sometimes it doesn't connect, and often doesn't have good sound quality for either party. I was bummed, since I really like the idea of conversing with a head set reminiscent of a traditional phone. I find them comfortable to talk into, and wanted the same feel for my cellphone.<br /><br />When I came across this corded product, I decided to give it a try. I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID! It just plugs into the cellphone. No need to have the units read each other. No charging. The phone can be answered through a button on the head set, or as normal on the cellphone. Sound quality is good, if not better, for both parties. The head set is comfortable, and the cord is adequately long enough. Same size and feel of a real telephone piece. I usually hate talking on my cellphone, but this makes a world of difference.  I have only used this at home, but I am not against using it out in public if desired.<br /><br />If this looks like something you would enjoy using, I recommend it.",

It has a clear piece of plastic that covers the screen and protects it from scratches. I have not EVER liked the ones that you stick to the screen, like this one has. Good luck getting it on without a finger print or a speck of dust getting on it while installing it. Also, the rubber feels super cheap and flimsy compared to mine. The only reason I chose this one was because she wanted one in green, and the one I ordered didn't come in green. So I took a chance. For the cost, it's not a huge deal but my experience with those sticky screen protectors has been that eventually, they lose their stick and you get bubbles that are impossible to get rid of.

So there is that. But still, a phone holder that doesn't really hold the phone securely? Meh, get the WeatherTech one instead.<br /><br />The cup part seems fine enough. It's not going to tip over or anything. It looks good and serves the purpose. HOWEVER, the phone holder itself doesn't “click” into the top of the gooseneck. So if you bump it, it's going to drop your phone. It's easy enough to glue the two pieces together though and solve that problem. It just seems like a silly design. Second complaint is that the plastic tabs that insert into the gooseneck or tiny bits of plastic. It's pretty much 2020, and we STILL have not learned not to make stress points out of tiny plastic??? Finally, if you have an iPhone 6s in an Otter case, it WILL fit, but not snugly. This could have easily been solved by making the side grips flat instead of curved. Or rather than having a button to release the grips, have a lock of some sort. Overall, I think it is overpriced based on the obvious flaws. I wouldn't pay more than $15 for this in hindsight unless they address these issues.",

From my perspective, I've found that the Milomdoi screen protector is a quality product and provides great value to protect my phone.  I have no issues with the screen protector as it protects the front screen & back cameras from scratches and works well with the fingerprint reader.  The installation instructions were easy to follow and the tiny air bubbles disappeared using the squeegee.  I recommend taking the time to view the short video prior to installing the screen protector.",

It's nice to be able to walk around with 1 clutch vs a wallet and a phone case.<br />*There are a lot of slots for storage with a huge clear panel for your license.<br /><br />Con:<br />*The finger activated security thingy opening on the back of the case is too small; so you have to take the removable case off to use this option. The potential for issue if you don't immidiately replace the case on the magnets is a bit concerning.<br />*It's a little bulkier than I expected. I find myself removing the case from the wallet portion often for easier handling - a thing I dont want to do when I'm out of the house.<br />*The charger port is also too small. I have to lift the phone out of the removable case to charge the phone. Annoying: I'm concerned about the potential for stretching the case over time and my phone falling out.<br />*There is no flip stand so if I want to watch videos on my phone, I have to prop my phone against whatever random object might be nearby.<br />*I don't know the name of the technology, but ive had phone cases that automatically sent the phone into sleep mode when I closed the case. This one doesn't have that tech so I need to make sure I send my phone to sleep before I close the case.<br /><br />I don't think I'll order this case again.

If you're a clutz, get a different cover that offers more protection. The magnet closure doesn't provide a secure close.

For me, the screen bows on the right part of the key board so when I need to use “L” or “M” or delete button I have to tap it several times, 4+ , for the screen to register that I'm trying to use that key. If I use swipe to text it's different and works fine but it's super annoying to have to type a key several types. I do also have a privacy screen protector on my screen so maybe with that and the built in screen plastic of the case it maybe too thick to type normally. I'm not sure. I've used my phone without this case but with the privacy screen and works as it should. With the case and the built in screen protector errors happen a lot and it's frustrating. The case itself is very pretty and seems sturdy. I'll be keeping it for now but I will most likely pick something else when later on.",

Well yeah, for best results what I do is 1 first I straighten it out to make a loop 2. then I make one bend at the end, to where it will be pointed toward my face. 3 then I make another bend and sometimes the 4th.  Now at this point, put it around your neck, now you can do fine adjustments and I really recommend because, I have many of these and a lot of them or not even worth $5, but with this one you can talk to your friends wave your hands and scream and holla.

This is a unique design. Most holders only feature articulation on one end.<br />* Ball joint movement is nice and rigid. You don't want it loose. You want to be able to maneuver it, but you also want it to hold the weight of your phone without budging. So this gets the job done.<br />* Three metal plates are included for you to adhere to cases, or surfaces that are not metal.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Surprising lightweight. I was expecting something heavy duty. The main round ends that houses the magnets seem to be chrome plated plastic. If it's not plastic, it's very lightweight aluminum. Nowhere in the listing does it describe what it's made of either, so I dunno. Overall, I'll rate it 4-Stars.",

You can also go the software route, but I prefer this physical jig because there is no need to have any software installed in my pc, tablet or smartphone.

Opposite of the hinge is a notch that can help you pry out the ring. I took close-up picture of this for you. However, you won't be able to get it out if your finger nails are freshly clipped. LOL! The notch was cut too shallow. You need a credit card, a toothpick, anything flat to dig in and pry it out.<br /><br />For the quality you're getting at this price, this would have been 5-Stars, but I'm docking 2 star for the ring being extremely difficult to pry out. To need a tool to pry out the ring is such an inconvenience. I won't be using it.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:adbc9f8ef3eb02e15527d76ac50c7d05]] THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Aesthetically, a beautiful wallet/kick stand for magsafe cases, or non-magsafe cases using the PD adapter. You don't even have to buy the PD adapter, you can buy a metal ring that's made for magsafe accessories.<br />* Magnetism is strong, but more on this in the \"bad\" section below.<br />* Using it as a kickstand works very well. Easily pivot the wallet from portrait to landscape. This is actually also a bad point, more on this below.<br />* Peak Design is a reputable company that makes some great stuff.<br />* If your car has a magnetic mount, this wallet will stick to it along with the phone. I discuss this in my video.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Though the magnetism is strong, the wallet is longer than the PD adapter. So the bottom half of the wallet can easily pivot since it's not sticking to anything. So imagine removing the phone and wallet out of your pocket, and the bottom of the wallet brushes against your hip or something, it can pivot and fall off the phone case. So you have to be careful with this. Ironically, this ability to pivot is actually a good thing when it comes to using the wallet as a kickstand. That is how you go from portrait to landscape easily. You just pivot/twist the wallet.<br />* Cards DO NOT cascade nicely like the stock photos.<br />* At 6 cards or more, there is friction when pushing closing the cards, so you'll have to support the bottom of the wallet when pushing the cards down, otherwise, you will push the wallet right off the phone, and people in line will stare at you. LOL!  I discuss this in my video too.<br /><br />Overall, I'll go 4-Stars.",

    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Aesthetically, a much nicer solution than round metal rings. If you already have a magsafe case, then you do not need this adapter to use the PD line of accessories. A magsafe case has built in metal ring in the back of it. You can also buy metal rings to stick to the back of any case to turn it into a \"magsafe\" case. But again, aesthetically, this is better than a round metal ring.<br />* The 3M on the back of this adapter is the real deal. Perhaps it sticks well because the entire back is 3M. The 3M for metal rings are terrible. I had a magnetic charger yank off the metal ring cause the adhesion was so weak. I think it has to do with the nature of the shape, a round adhesion ring is hollow in the middle, so it's weak.<br />* I have a Google Pixel 6 Pro, and wireless charging was not an issue with this adapter. That was my main concern. I wondered if the thickness of the case, plus the thickness of this adapter would make wireless charging ineffective. I'm happy to report wireless charging still works nicely.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Nothing at all. 5-Stars!",

It is simply A.I. witchcraft and it just works. I have no clue how or why it works, it just does.<br />* Some of these holders can make a motor noise that you cannot hear, but your camera may record it, and you'll hear it when you replay your video. I've seen people say they get motor noise with this exact model. However, that hasn't been my experience at all. I don't know if the phone you use has anything to do with it, but I use a Google Pixel 6 Pro, and I don't get any motor noise in my videos. This thing has been perfect.<br /><br />HOW TO OPERATE:<br />-----------------------<br />* Charge it, or keep it connected to a power source and use immediately.<br />* Place your phone on it.<br />* Secure it with the onboard tightening knob.<br />* Hold power button for 3 seconds. It will blink red. Now if you skip the manual, this is where you get confused because it simply shuts itself off. I admit, I didn't read the manual. LOL! Anyway, after turning it on and seeing it blink red, you need to face the camera and make an OK sign with your fingers. The led turns green and it starts tracking you. Again, no wifi, no bluetooth, just an OK sign with your fingers. LOL! Simply amazing.<br />* To pause the tracking, Give it an \"OPEN PALM\" sign like you're about to give it a high five.

The diameter of the unit is slightly bigger than the diameter of the top of a coke can.<br />* If you don't have a magsafe case, they included a metal ring that you can apply to your case via double sided adhesive. Voila.. you now have a magsafe case.<br />* Not just limited to iPhones. You can use this on virtually any case for any phone. I will be using this with my Pixel 6 Pro.<br />* Built in kick stand/ring holder.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Adds bulk to your phone. But it is detachable at any moment. So you can pick and choose when you want to use it. This doesn't bother me. I've been waiting for a substantial ring holder on the market.

    "text": "THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* You get two 5ft cables with four charging heads on each.<br />* Braided cables are much easier to manage and move around than standard plastic covered ones.<br />* Super convenient. Instead of having 4 different cables taking up 4 different ports, or having to unplug and replug cables.<br />* USB-C, Micro USB, iPhone, and iPhone + Sync.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Nothing at all.<br /><br />I don't have high demands, or are constantly in a hurry, so I never test for speed. I would imagine the cable doesn't really matter, it's the charging tech in your charger. All I can say is that these cables are super convenient. Just have one connected near you, and you're good! When you're sitting at your desk doing your work, drinking your coffee and your phone is out of battery, or one of you kids comes to you and ask to charge something.... instead of unplugging, or getting up and looking for a cable, you simply plug the proper head into the device... done. 5-Stars!",

I think since I've gotten this case, they've changed their wording to bumper, which is more accurate.<br />* When I got this, I was very disappointed because I thought I didn't have to shop for a screen.

Unfortunately, the kick-stand is a separate piece that will stick your case via double sided tape. How elegant for your $1000 phone. LOL! Usually built in kick-stands are flush with the case when closed. This double sided tape kick-stand won't be flush. The Google Pixel 6 Pro already has a camera that won't be flush with the case, the last thing I want is more things not flush with the case.

These types of chargers are made in a variety of options ranging from 1 to 4 ports. Always go for the 4 ports, more is always better. This 2 usb, 2 usb-c version is just the right amount for practical use.

It is not ideal to always go to the wall to plug in your device. it's much more convenient if you have a longer power cord that would allow you to put the unit on a table, on your desk, etc. You can then sit down on your couch, plug in what you need to plug to the unit that's sitting nicely on your end table. The most convenient charger I own is this one: https://www.amazon.com/review/R2SROX9NE6XUW2/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07Y1RTYPV<br /><br />However, the Alogic is a 100w gan charger, that in itself makes it 5-stars! I will dock one star for not providing a cord option as others do. They could make these products so much more convenient for people.",

The window isn't completely flat and tight, so there is some play, I'm assuming that's by designing. What I mean by play, is that when you touch the window, it can move a little. So this gives flexibility if your phone isn't quite thick enough where the screen would touch the window, you would need to push in the window a little bit. So the flexibility helps. On the other hand, you can't have too thick of a case, there isn't much clearance, so you may need to remove your case. For $10, it is what it is. The adhesive is strong. I'll rate this 4-stars.",

    "text": "Pros:<br />-----<br />-Compact, small<br />-Removable tripod<br />-telescoping neck<br />-App functions as it should. Everything smooth.<br /><br />Cons:<br />------<br />-It's on the cheap side. Light plastic, whole unit with tripod is 8.2 ounces.<br />-If you're uncomfortable with using foreign apps, then you might want to skip this one because it does not work with your camera app. I reviewed another gimbal that works with your phone's camera app, at least the important functions. So you don't have to use an unknown app. But this gimbal doesn't seem to work with anything but it's own app.<br />-If you don't like removing your case from your phone, well then your phone and case together has to be super thin. I have a Oneplus 5t with a super thin case, and it works.<br />-Other gimbals do not require you to balance your phone completely in the center because of it's build, but those gimbals are usually bigger and weighted on one side. This gimbal is small and completely neutral, so it requires you to put the phone in the holder completely at center. I have my power and volume buttons near center of phone, so they get pressed.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for something small and you don't mind using a foreign app, this gets the job done. It feels very smooth. It rotates vertically to horizontally at a press of a button. The tripod and telescoping neck are very useful. I'll give this 4 stars.",

But remember that on certain VR videos on YT, at least the good ones that are 360 immersive, you need to click the GOGGLE icon in the Youtube video itself. Because when you start playing a Youtube VR video, it assumes you do not have a google, and so the default is non-VR. You need to change it to VR by hitting goggle icon. Around this price point, some goggles come with a button so you can make selections within they YT app without having to remove your phone, but this goggle doesn't have such button. The padding around the eyes are adequate and comfortable. Overall, I'll subtract 1 start because it's missing a feature others have at this price point.",

This box has an inner dimension of 7.3 x 3.5 x 2.1, making it deep enough for your phones with cases as well as odd shapes such as your keys. The box has a smooth look with rounded corners. It looks like a high end Samsung accessory. It has wireless charging on top of the lid which worked even when my iphone had a case on it. The lights will automatically turn off if you lift the lid to protect your eyes. 5 star item!",

At first, I thought it didn't work. I had to close one eye to be focused, and no matter how I adjusted the settings on the goggles, nothing worked. Then I realize that you have to click the GOGGLE icon in the Youtube video itself. When you start playing a Youtube VR video, it assumes you do not have a google, and so the default is non-VR. You need to change it to VR, then you'll see the video split into two. Now when you insert into the goggle, you get VR! There is also a button under the mask that allows you to move a little cursor around, but so far, the only thing you can do is stop or pause the video. So unfortunately, you cannot control the entire youtube app. But that's not an issue with the goggle, I believe the onus would be on Youtube to make the app goggle friendly. So currently, you have to remove phone to change volume, to change video or search, or you can simply allow the next video to play. Fortunately, taking out the phone is simple, you can just reach on top of the headset and press the tab. No need to remove headset every-time you need access to your phone. Build quality is very nice. I like it.",

It's very apropos that I got this on Vine to help me with Vine product reviews. :) Very nice package for the price. Comes with with a drawstring pouch, go pro adapter, bluetooth shutter remote, and the ball head has a built in smartphone holder. The bendy legs are strong and stay put. I attached my Sony A6000 on the ball head, and I was confident enough to hold it upside down. Take a look at the pictures. There were no instructions on how to access the smartphone holder, but it was easy enough to figure out. Nevertheless, I made a video to make things even easier for you. 5 star item!",

Well, I thought that when you plug in a usb device into the OTG cable, the phone would give you a similar notice, so when it didn't I thought the cable was defective. I did not know that OTG STORAGE is something you have to TURN ON. For my android Oneplus 5t, this setting is located in SYSTEMS. 2 cables for less than $5, and they work. No complaints.

For purposes of this review, I used this headset with my iPhone 6s.<br /><br /> Pros: It has a rugged design, but is light weight and extremely comfortable to wear. In the box you receive the headset, 2 wind socks, 2 spare rubber ear pieces, a spare ear clip, and a charging cord. The headset stayed in place well, even while doing some light manual labor. Incoming sound was clear and easy to understand. The controls are simple to work.<br /><br /> Cons: Outgoing transmissions sound tinny and have a slight echo to the person on the other end of the call. The battery life is short. If used moderately heavy, it will not last an 8 hour work day. The charging cord is very short. You have to download and install an App on your phone in order to use this headset. It is the first time I have seen that. The App also contains a locator feature to find your headset and digital manuals.<br /><br /> Summary: While this headset is very comfortable to wear and sounds good on my end, it may not be good for those with whom you are talking. The short battery life means you will have to charge it mid day. Having to use space on the phone for a separate App to use the device is also a downer for me. This would not be my first choice of a headset.",

    "text": "Right out of the box, it's basically ready to go. You have to program the remote to your phone but it isn't hard. Turn on your Bluetooth and on the side of the remote, flip the little switch and it should pop up on your phone. Connect and you're ready to take pictures. To turn the lights up and down and switch between the three different light settings, the controls are on the cord. I have found I have to press pretty hard sometimes to make it change. I don't know how much longer it will last with having to press as hard as I do sometimes. The lights I also feel aren't as bright as I need. I have to have it all the way up and almost right next to it. I have a plus size phone and I feel like it's going to break putting it in the holder and I don't feel like it's going to hold it long. Overall, I think it's okay but it's the first one I've ever owned so I don't have a lot to compare it to.",

I had to get a replacement because their was an issue with my first order. It came in no time flat & the seller was easy to communicate with & resolved it immediately. I will absolutely buy from them again & cant recommend them highly enough. I give the seller & product 5 stars & would rate them even higher if I could!",
