I haven't tried it with any mono headphones and am sorry but grateful for those who did try but were unsuccessful. I experienced increased audio esp with my motorola s805 to where I no longer have to run everything at full blast so I am not sure which did that-the head phones or adapter. They are not Bluetooth 2.0 but are A2DP profile but that does not seem to have made a difference for me.<br />I am getting more stereo headphones shortly and will update if I have problems.",

I gave the wallet a couple (not too hard) shakes and the phone fell out and on the ground. And the case that the phone sits in is a good snug fit and the back of it is the same cute gold glitter.

I really never expected this high a level of customer service. I highly recommend purchasing from them--whatever the issue they seem dedicated to making it right! They also left a response as follows: \"When installing Skinomi Tech-skins you do not need to wait the full 12-24 hours for the screen to set by the way. Most of our customers simply wait overnight or 2-3 hours is more than sufficient. Please note you do not need a lot of solution for the screen to install well. A fine but even layer is keep to a good install. The solution itself is completely harmless Next, rather than laying the screen down all at once. Try laying it down from one side to another slowly. This will help prevent any large bubbles or imperfections from occurring. Finally, any excess bubbles or micro bubbles should disappear within 2-3 days!\"<br /><br />My previous review: I found the instructions clear and packaging very good, however, the cleaning cloth was not included. I also only received 1 skin--I was under the impression that I would receive several. This seems to be a good product but I was overall disappointed since I did not get everything I paid for. Also, be aware that the manufacturer recommends waiting 12-24 hours after application of the skin before turning your phone back on so it's best to install in the evening before bed so you have use of your phone during the day!",

    "text": "I like this software overall and some of NatGeo's maps. I would have given it 5 stars if NatGeo had not been so tight with the map data.  You get all of Maryland beyond Baltimore 3.5 hours West of Baltimore (almost 200 miles!)but once over the Bay Bridge (about 40 miles) there is little of the Eastern Shore beyond the actual shoreline. There are a lot of fantastic Parks and great Rivers just a bit further East and still in Maryland but NatGeo didn't want to give up the extra quads to include these areas since they also include Delaware. Shame on you NatGeo! Cheap and greedy of you. I would have gladly paid a few extra bucks to have the MD's Eastern Shore and the Delaware Shore included with the DC/Balto region.  Also, the maps are pretty old--1970's.  I'd like to see NatGeo put a little more effort into this one.",

I would recommend these case to anyone that likes the weight and shape<br />of the phone without a case as this is the Closest you can come and still be well protected.<br /><br />Thanks a Bunch Spigen, Great Job!!!",

When I got it, my first impression was that it was great quality. It was pretty and felt heavy. I knew from experience though not to write a review then. I have bought so many things like this that look great but just do not work. My daughter put this on her keychain Christmas Day, and she has been using it ever since. She loves it, and It works great!!!  She hasn't had any trouble with it at all! I would definitely recommend that you get this charger.",

I'm not too sure about having a non replaceable battery, we'll just have to see how long it lasts.  One star off for the picture and video quality.  It is noticeably lesser quality than my previous Samsung phone.  It is adequate, not excellent in that department.<br /><br />UPDATE 6-10-2016:  After 10 months this phone has crapped out.  The menu and home buttons now only vibrate and do nothing else.  This was after I was forced to do a factory reset because the phone all of a sudden refused to open past an Alcatel splash screen...<br />This phone was used very little, never saw anything close to abuse, and had no additional software installed except for the endless automatic updates for the pre-installed apps the phone would initiate every time it was hooked to WiFi.  This quickly ate up the phone's internal memory, regardless of having a 16Gb memory card installed (phone only comes with 2Gb internal memory).  This kept me in a continuous cycle of shutting down apps that CAME WITH THE PHONE.  Their warranty stinks and is very unyielding.  When we called support they immediately sent us to the return page.  Yeah, read THAT.  This phone carries my HOME phone number, but they have no reservations of having you go without a phone for 10 days while they determine whether it is your fault or theirs.  I paid good money to learn a hard lesson.  This phone is NOT worth it!",

I was bummed when I had to search for a new phone because all of the phones these days are so big. It's like technology when from being huge to getting tiny and now it's all huge again. So I wanted a case that was protective but not too bulky, and this fit the bill.<br /><br />The popsocket I put on it seems to be holding on just fine. The case is nice and smooth for that.<br /><br />It could be considered a little bit slick but definitely not the slickest I've seen. I don't have a problem holding it with our without a popsocket.<br /><br />And I love the beautiful color! It's a rich purple that's not too dark and not too light.

I can still talk on the phone (a little awkwardly) and take pictures while it is in the case. For one charger I can plug it in just fine but for another charger it's like the prongs of it are too short so it just falls out, so it really depends on the charger. It just means I have to take it out of the case when I use that particular charger, which is a little tough to do. The magnet is quite weak and that would be my only real complaint. it doesn't pop open, but it feels like it will come unlatched easily. It holds my debit card, driver's license, and cash. Can't store too many bills in cash though or the gets pretty thick, and that's where I'm worried that the magnet will fail.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I bought it.",

I think Verizon missed its mark here, which is sad, because I trust them as a phone company. I was definitely misled buy the sales clerk when they praised this phone. Do not buy if you want a phone that can have apps, store lots of text messages, browse the web quickly, and the list goes on.

My screen has never cracked using the provided fitted screen protector. However, I have two problems.  the new case I just received is faulty. The front right side seems to have excess material at the top and bottom that isn't letting it wrap securely and tightly on my phone. I've had this issue before but due to my own user error, as I placed the screen too far over causing the case to not fit. This time it is the case itself. Really bummed about this especially because as I was putting it on I noticed that this case is causing damage to the sides on my phone I wish I could get a picture of. Tiny chips of paint being taken off I imagine due to the case snapping on and off because of falls, or even when I sit down with it in my pocket. They are tiny chips but clearly adding up since I am a repeated user of this phone case 😔 with these two issues I imagine I'll be in the market for a different phone case in the future.",

    "text": "This is the case you want.  I bought the slimmer version made by Spigen and it was truly flimsy and not designed well.  This case is rugged, feels dense and sturdy, protects the essential drop points, and isn't too pricey.  The hinge cover is designed well, but it prevents you from laying the phone down on a flat surface (makes a see-saw).  The two pieces of the case adhere to the phone by small adhesive pads.  In my case, at least three of the little stickers ended up getting pulled off when I tried to remove the plastic strip covers.  The case is still very well adhered to the phone due to the tight fit of the design.  This case feels like it should be shipped with the phone, it checks every block I have.  In the other Spigen case, the only charger I could use was the cord supplied with the phone, whereas this case has more room for third party charging cables.  The finish is matte satin and surprisingly does not attract dirt and oil when used in a normal environment or placed in a linty pocket.  The only minor flaw is how close the case gets to the screen area.  On the front screen, the case almost makes swiping down for notifications a real pain.  The solution to this is to swipe down from where the case has a section cut out for the camera, as it gives the screen more room to recognize your finger.  Some minor dust and dirt may accumulate in the areas where the case meets the screen, but this is still not a huge hassel to wipe away with a t-shirt or microfiber cloth.  The inside screen area has the same deep ledge which sometimes limits swipes from the bottom, but it happens mostly when I'm not paying attention to the phone.  While the case is obviously a bit chunky, I believe it is still the best case on the market for this phone right now.",

I am buying a new case right now because that one left side piece of plastic is so flimsy.  I hate that this case also seems to collect lint and small hair underneath.  This case also does not allow the phone to sit flat on a table when open, the left half of the case is thinner than the right half.  This creates a small \"rocking\" when typing on the left side of the screen.  Lastly, the opening for the charger is small, meaning it is not likely to accept a charger other than the one that shipped with the phone.  I don't recommend this case unless the design issues are addressed and the price goes down.",

It also worries me that the magnets in the case closure are kinda close to my cards, which could mess up the magnetic strip. Also, the case doesn't really have a self-stand-up feature, which feels like a missed opportunity.

I thought it would look nicer and more unique than the standard glossy fingerprint-riddled surface.  It does feel like a strong protector, and it was very easy to install with the instructions and included sticker tools.  Do not expect a perfect installation, but if you take your time and use the stickers provided, you'll get most of the dust off of the screen so that there are no bubbles.  I subtracted a star because the matte finish of the protector seems to have faded with use.  It might be the natural oils of my hands and face, but it is significant enough that I feel the product could be improved.  I've seen other matte screen protectors with a more porous surface which leads to a longer lasting finish.  Overall, does a great job to protect against scratches.  This does not protect against cracks, so buy a case as well.",

I bought a short cord and keep it in the handy bag the battery comes with.<br />It's a little bulky for everyday use, but I am happy with it for my needs.",

I knew I would have to go back and add my fingerprints again after applying the screen protector which I did.. and in order to get a good read, you have to push very hard and firm making it quite difficult and not convenient for the fingerprint reader.  I just turned off this feature and everything else is great!",

I had to go back and add letters that I missed because it didnt pick up my touche.<br /><br />Second, I had to remove my glass screen protector because it absolutely wasnt picking up any kind of touche with that on and then the otterbox plastic screen over that.  I removed the $40 glass protector that I had on, then realized that the plastic otterbox screen was crap.  Great.<br /><br />I finally, out of frustration, removed the plastic otterbox screen by peeling it off of the case.  It was easy to do and MUCH better now.  I just wish I would have kept my glass on instead because there is temporarily nothing covering my screen right now :/",

I went to Verizon and they wanted to charge me $65 to put one on and I decided to give it another shot and glad I did.

I know the phone is supposed to be good on it's own, but it's nice to help keep the dust out of cracks and to give a little further protection, after all the deductible for our insurance is $100.  And the cases help personalize.  Stickers are just not an option for us.  We want a quality case for this phone and can't believe, Casio doesn't have any, plus the attachment for a wrist strap should also be available since their is a location for it but no accessory and we haven't found any wrist strap that would attach because the eyelets are too small.

This one feels very similar to the seidio & a rare quality case since the lg g2 from Verizon is so difficult to find a case for.  We tried many cases and returned all but 2 since we had 2 phones.  This one was made with quality and protective for the entire phone.  It comes around the front far enough to protect the lense and has a rubber plastic combination for protection.  I like the rubber buttons in the back making it easier to push the on off screen or volume and it grips well and looks nice.  I don't know why they have so many stupid childish designs on this case but they have enough of the better colors.<br /><br />It also comes with a screen saver made for this case which we realized needed to be applied with the case installed so that you know where the screen saver needs to be and the case then doesn't put pressure on the screen saver causing it to bubble.  My husband got the screen saver on right and it all works together great!  The screen saver fits just inside the case perfectly.

It also would never get my device to a 100% charge whether the charger was plugged in the wall or not. Regardless I was still content with it.<br /><br />Hate- now it doesn't charge my device at all. I haven't owned it for very long.<br /><br />( also the photo shows what looks like two chargers; it is only one)",

This was a great concept because the phone doesn't slip out of my hand, (I highly recommend the ring)  Unfortunately, the ring hits the back of the holder which prematurely closes the arms and I have to use both hands to adjust the phone to fit in the holder.  If the side arms and foot were even 1/4\" longer it wouldn't be a problem.<br />I installed it on my windshield and it really stuck.  Unfortunately (again) I had to move it.  Now the suction cup cannot be re-stuck.  Wish there was a replacement sticky pad for the cup.  I'm pretty handy and can improvise a fix for the arm length as well as sticking problem...just wish I didn't have to.<br />I like the fact that the holder does not block accessory ports on my phone.  All in all it is a good product and if I need to, I will purchase another one.",

    "text": "LThis case is a high quality and durable protection for your iPhone! I don't like Otter Boxes because they are so big and bulky. This case is very slender and not very bulky. I like that it has the holster clip and you can slide your phone it with the speaker facing towards the ceiling or the floor. This is perfect for me as a restaurant manager - when I'm on the line cooking I face my speaker down to the floor so I don't get any drips or crumbs in it and when I'm in the office or on the floor I face the speaker up towards the ceiling so I can hear it better. You cannot face the screen out, but that is for your phones protection.<br />  Even the stand works great (standing up and on side) and is durable. I don't use it much because I don't like that you cannot adjust the angle. It stands the phone almost straight up and down. My personal preference is just a slight angle for playing my games. Not a bad thing by any means, just a preference issue.",

    "text": "I just got a new Galaxy Watch 4 and the band that came with it was a new design for me.  The end of the band tucked into the inside of the band rather than outside like a traditional watch band.<br />While that was nice, it was more difficult for me to get the watch off quickly so I started looking for other types of bands<br />This one caught my eye and it was also \"no gap\" which means the top of the strap which connects to the body of the watch was curved so that there was no gap between the band and the watch.  Now, I didn't know that was either a feature or a problem, all my other watches and bands had always had that gap, but this was an interesteing feature and this band had it, so I gave it a try.<br />I had also purchased some additional bands that were not No Gap  and I didn't like the color of the band that came with the watch. That means I had the original band and a few more to compare to this band.<br />The packaging is a bit odd with some questionable grammar choices, but overall I really liked the band.  It is made of a flexible material that fits well and I can adjust it to be more snug or loose as needed.<br />The only thing I had a slight problem with was the fact that the end of the band was outside the watch and could get caught.<br />That's right, the very reason I got this one was the one feature I had problems with.  I fixed the problem easily by sliding the little holding straps closer to the end of the band.  In this kind of flexible band the end does stick out and can get caught on things, but the benefits outweigh this little problem.<br />Overall, I'm very happy with the band, it makes it much easier to do the EKG, Stress anf O2 levels since it has a more snug fit.  If you are looking for a nice band, this one is well worth considering.",

    "text": "I've used Android Auto for at least the last 5-6 years and it's always been annoying that you can't use it wirelessly.  The newer cars have the wireless option, but for those of us with cars that don't have that option, this device is great.<br />When connecting with a wire, sometimes it gets tangled, or if you need to use the phone to pay for something in a drive thru and often this disconnects the AA.  With this device, you just plug it in, connect it via Bluetooth and away you go.  No need to rearrange it, and it also reconnects the next time you get in the car, so it takes the hassle out of AA.<br />It comes with two USB connections, the device has a USB C connection and so it has a USB - C to USB - A and also a USB -C to USB - C cable so you can hook it up either way.<br />It's a bit pricey at $99 and I think there is another one that may be cheaper, but this one works which is worth a few extra bucks.<br />I can definitely recommend it if you want to get rid of the cables.  Another benefit is that the Android Auto connection, at least in the two cars I use doesn't charge the phone very well, so with the wireless you can plug the phone into a fast charger and use Bluetooth for AA and you are good to go.",

I've tried the ones that fit in the cup holder, the ones that have a goose neck that positions the phone at an odd angle, the ones that stick to your dashboard, and then I settled on an air vent holder that I got free at a trade show.  It didn't work very well, but I liked the concept so I started looking for others.<br />I found one that was ok, but it blocked the air vent and would occasionally fall off.  I looked at the reviews and features and liked the fact that it has a little hook to attach it to the vent and also it said that it didn't block the vent.  Well, I've heard that before so I didn't have much hope that I could use the air vent, but the hook seemed like a great addition so I ordered it.<br />I've been very happy, it stays on, it is not a hassle to take off if I want to and yes, it really does not block the flow of air from the vent.  It sticks out a bit, but that's why it doesn't block the vent  I also like the little button on the back that releases the phone.  You just put the phone in the device, and then push the sides in to hold it.  When you want to take it out, there is a button on the back which is easy to get to and it releases the side holders.<br />So, if you are looking for this kind of device, then I can highly recommend this one.  It's been great and I've used it almost daily for several weeks.",

    "text": "For a long time now, this has been required phone protection for every single one of my family members.<br /><br /> I have three kids. They can't afford to repair their own phones. After more than enough costly screen replacements, I did the research and found the OtterBox defender.<br /><br /> Because I like different colors, I have probably bought about 10 of these over the years. They all held up and they all protected my phone and my family members' phones from unbelievable levels of clumsiness and abuse. Once I even accidentally dropped my phone out of a second-story window onto my asphalt driveway. The phone suffered no damage whatsoever.<br /><br />Any phone I am financially responsible for gets dressed in one of these, period.<br /><br />Some people worry that they are bulky. I worried about that myself initially. Interestingly, I now very much like the rubbery edge.  I have used the iPhone 6 since it came out, and the ridge on the outer edge of the OtterBox defender actually makes my phone a lot easier to hold in one hand and to thumb-type on. Does it take up more room in a pocket? Yes. Is it worth it to me? Absolutely.<br /><br /> Sometimes I use the holster/stand accessory, and sometimes I don't. It's great to just clamp onto your belt for long walks with the dogs in the woods, etc. Maybe not such a good look for a dinner party.  It's easy to take off the holster/stand feature with one hand and toss it into a drawer or your purse. Both the clamp and the stand pop-out feature work well and hold up to punishment.<br /><br /> This is one of my very favorite products in the world. And, no, nobody gives me free products or cares whether I review anything or not. I'm just trying to save a few more phone screens out there.",

It either is not responsive, or overly responsive. It also misinterprets what I am trying to access when touching the screen.<br />So every time I use this phone I am always jumping in and out of areas I never intended to be in.  And when then phone becomes unresponsive, I cannot leave the areas I never wanted to be in the first place.<br /><br />Another issue with the screen is that it scratches way too easy. Even after getting protectors, it's impossible to see the screen in any sunlight at all.<br /><br />Internet is so slow it's beyond useless and I have cancelled my data plan after just a week of use<br /><br />The phone also will occasionally just freeze up.  Like on a call and you want to hang up .. but the phone will not hang up (had to pull the battery)<br /><br />TMobile will be glad to replace the phone with a new one, but the same problems persist. I can't wait to get out of this piece of junk.<br /><br />===============<br />UPDATE 1yr later<br />===============<br />Still the worst phone I have ever owned .. I hate it<br />I have called TMOBILE every month for 12 months trying to get upgraded .. or anything to get a new phone and got nothing except buy a new phone at above retail prices. I gave up dealing with the phone and TMOBILE. So much for being with TMOBILE for 10+ years.<br />I am counting the days to get out of my contract and will switch to Verizon and iPhone or DROID as soon as I can.<br />Without a real smartphone .. your really missing out on some of the best technology and apps around.",

There's also a little porthole window on the bottom/back to allow use of the camera while it's in the case. The handlebar clamp easily swivels to allow portrait or landscape use. About the only thing I can see that someone might want is a way to plugin a set of ear buds but there is no access to allow that.

You could probably slide some bills in the slot under the cards on the left side but it will be a pain each time you do it. The problem is that with a DL and three bank cards the wallet has a bulge when you close it and the magnetic closure will not grip and keep it secure. The other problem is that with four cards in this case and you close it it will turn on your cell. I had to change mine to a 15 second screen lock so it would not do that. But, in the end it will have to go back. Sadly, a simple design change of increasing the back binder spacing by twice the width would allow this case to close easily with the cards and cell.",
