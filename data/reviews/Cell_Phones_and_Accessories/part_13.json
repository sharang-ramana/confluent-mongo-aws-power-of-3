I like to decorate my wheelchair with lights and projectors so I usually end up powering them with powerbanks.  I have used a lot of powerbanks and they all work the same for the most part.  However,  this one is a little different.  It contains some charging cords already attached to the bank.  It has a charging cable for a micro USB, a type c one, and one of those Apple ones.  Now anyone can use it to charge their phone in an emergency regardless of the type.  It is also less bulky and easier to use on my lights.  Now I don't have to worry about a separate cable dangling down or getting snagged on something.  It takes up less room as well because the cords wrap around the bank and get tucked into the sides.  The battery life is great and the charging time isn't bad either.",

The last thing you want is for your phone to fly into your face during an accident or even just a sudden stop.  This one is much different.  It holds the phone securely,  but it also attaches to the car vent very well.  I don't have to worry about it being knocked out of place or my phone getting damaged.  There's also a really nice feature that I have never seen before.  You can actually move the phone itself out of the way of the vent.

The cool white setting is good for showing the detail of my stitches. The warm setting is good for accentuating the beauty of the sweaters I made especially when someone is modeling them.  The vintage setting is good for my little dolls when I set them up in a cute little scene.  The battery lasts for a long time.",

It's just a part of wearing this type of band. It isn't perfect, but close.<br />I really enjoyed wearing this soft suede boho band. It's very pretty in person. I think it's durable enough for occasional wear. I'd like a few other colors to add to my watch collection, wish it came in white!<br />The Tiffany blue is beautiful.

Easy to adjust the belt to correct size needed and fits wide range of sizes. Holds multiple items and is great to use while at the beach or if you are boating. I live in Central Florida and rain is a normal almost daily thing through the summer this is a must have. We mainly have this on hand for cell phones in case we are out and it rains. I walk a lot and this is great to use for that while being hands free to push a stroller. Cell phone and ID some cash or debit cards all can fit in here with ease. Just nothing sharp!<br />I did my water test with my camera as it is waterproof just in case. I let it stay in the sink of water for about 5 minutes, it kept floating so I would turn and dunk and swish it. It stayed dry!!!! I recommend that before each use you look it over in the light for any holes or possible rips and check the seams also. You may be careful with it but it can weaken with sun and heat exposure. I received this product free sin exchange for testing and review purposes. I am satisfied with the product as it did what it was supposed to do.",

The connection is solid and charging is smooth. There is no power gap in them. I also love that they are black and white so they look different than the iPad and Samsung cords so finding it is fast and easy. These were provided to me for free for consumer testing and review.

I took off one star because it is almost to easy to adjust and the holder piece pulls from the flat pad fairly easy. While it doesn't affect the in home use it may affect the car use and it may fall out with a hard turn and the weight of a phone.<br />It works easily for a tablet also. We can put a Samsung 7&#34; and when you widen out the holder we can place an iPad mini in it also. Great to use at the bedside and takes very little room. The rubber is thick and a good quality it isn't going to split or tear. What is really great is this seals so well to almost any surface and doesn't slide around. There is also nothing to break!! Fits such a wide range of phones and tablets.<br />I was provided this dash mat for consumer use and review.",

Super fast to get on and off but stays on well. The outer shell snaps on with ease holding the rubber piece snug to the phone. This case does not come with a screen protector you will need to supply that separate.

So while I want to give it 4 stars I have to hold back due to a couple things.<br /><br />The good: Affordable, easy to fold, easy to use<br />  This is a great way to get your toes wet in VR without pricey commitment. Also this is very low tech and easy to use for many people.<br />The bad:  Cardboard, parts will tear somewhat easy ( fixed temporarily with tape)<br />  Doesn't fit too many styles of phones. Able to fit a Nexus 5X but the 6P is too large ( and cases need to come off)<br />  The rubber band that you are supposed to use to hold it on has no stretch so we can't use it....makes it totally hand held and arms tired.<br />The verdict: If you want an introduction to VR that wont break the bank this is okay. If you want to try it and see if it makes you &#34;sick&#34; then this is a good choice. There is an app available &#34;cardboard&#34; and you can get the info by scanning a QR code on the viewer. There are neat scenes to download and enjoy. We know now that we would like to up the game and try a hard plastic model . Now, I know some of you hate the &#34;I received&#34; reviews but I did get this discounted. I STILL PURCHASED THIS ITEM ( just a discount given )and I am satisfied with it for what it is. Current price is $10 and that is okay. No, it is not worth more and I would not pay more for the cardboard models. Yes, it is good for an intro and to see if you think you would even use it.",

Currently we are using the standard charging cords that came with the electronics but will be replacing them with short cords ( and converters for C type).<br />I like that this charging station is so lightweight and slim in design but it is sturdy and it looks nice on the desk ( even better when I clean up the desk!). So far, I waited a few days for review, I have had o hiccups with this charging station, all the ports were tested and work correctly. The slots are easy to keep clean with a swiffer duster once a week (or as needed of course). I have this plugged into a surge protector ( we get a ton of lightening here in Central Florida). I am super happy with this charging station.<br />All my electronics brought together and located in one place, no more where is my cord, where is my tablet, have you seen....If you are looking for one it is certainly worth the full retail.

The charging technology in your phone, and the starting charge level of your battery, all impacts how the process proceeds, and the resulting VA output. 72 watts is a semantical error. This will never happen. The unit itself states if you attempt this mythical 72 watt charge, it will only produce 24 watts max, while using both ports. Since the theoretical max is 36 watts on a single port then the actual max is 36 watts. In practice, you likely will only get 27 watts max, based on what's plugged in for the vast majority of uses. I have not tried plugging in a laptop, yet, but I will. It seems though, 36 watts might be a little light for that use. We will have to see. My main reason for purchasing this, was it's size.

    "text": "These, are probably the hot method for screen covers. Imported from China, at little cost, they can be found for a variety of prices, this 2-Pack, with lifetime warranty, is about the bottom price range.<br /><br />PRO: I ordered mine around midnight, Friday, and received it the following Sunday. Which means, they sent it out on Saturday, and I got it the very next day. So this is incredible, never had Sunday delivery. I felt special. :-) Their HQ is in San Francisco, so that must explain it all, being so close. :-)<br /><br />CON: As hard as I try, I can't get the screen cover to sit fully on my iPhone 5/5S screens. I have two devices, and on both of them, the upper left hand corner of the protector, does not stick. There's a slight air gap. It's not particularly noticeable, and it does not touch or interfere with the display, but I hardly think this product is going to stay on. It was a long shot and I suspect my family members will complain about it soon enough. I have a similar product, priced at the top end of the spectrum and it's perfect. I had a similar product as XOXO, priced a bit more moderately and it too was very good. No air gaps.<br /><br />My complaint for XOXO is, their adhesive is not good enough. There's something not right in it's application. On two separate phones, where it does not stick, in the exact same place, means they have a QA problem.<br /><br />As far as protecting the phone and the functionality of tempered glass, I won't have it any other way. This product will do that job, I am sure, very well. My son's phone has already been saved by the sacrificial nature of tempered glass.<br /><br />The texture of the cover, touching and moving across the screen, is silky smooth. I like it a lot. It's practically invisible, and does not change the appearance of the screen.<br /><br />I wish I could give it more stars, but at this point, the adhesive and warrantee seem to be the only factor separating this product from all the others. It's not working so well, that way.",

There is about 1/8 of an inch space between the screen shield and the case so I'm sure dust and debris will settle in there and that's annoying. Also where the display stops at the bottom the screen shield is slightly lower so it looks like it's over hanging and the case is even lower with about 1/8 of an inch gap. And there's a little spot at the bottom where it hasn't completely adhered to the screen. It is very thick  so you won't have to worry about scratching your screen and that's a plus but I did have to go into settings and adjust the screen sensitivity  because sometimes swiping had to be repeat several times before it worked. It's that thick. As I said overall it's okay but if, like me you have mild to moderate OCD and little things like this would bother you, don't get it.",

Instead of being clear with an all-over iridescent shine, it's hazy purple with thin bright rainbow lines when light hits it from an angle. There's one awkward spot in the center of the back where it clings closer to the phone and creates a dark patch. I've taken it off multiple times and wiped both pieces to make sure it's not wet, but nothing gets rid of that clingy patch.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this brand again because of the fit and quality, but I wouldn't get this particular case due to the look.",

    "title": "LG G4 case is a perfect fit and it's attractive",
    "text": "I recently had my LG G4 repaired and decided to purchase a new case for the phone with its new innards.  This is superior to my previous case in fit, durability and attractive color combination,  Included is a screen protective sheet and concise instructions for putting the case onto the phone.  In order to get a proper fit and save the case, be sure to remove the hard plastic shell from the flexible case.  Move the little flaps at the bottom a few times to get them used to being moved and then slip it onto your phone.  Now snap the harder shell onto the phone, clicking it into the fitted spots and be sure the flaps are accessible.  I've had no problems opening and closing them to insert my charging cable or earphone miniplug and they are securely protected when I snap the flaps into the case.  A nice feature is the protection this affords to the slots which naturally have a tendency to develop a dust or dirt accumulation.  The colors of the actual case are more minty green than the yellow green of the image I see online.  The light teal is a pretty complement.  Since the LG G4 is a thinner style phone, this case does detract from its design but protecting the phone is more important to me and even with the case, its thinner than most others.  All openings are well beveled and the phone operates perfectly.  It's quite a bargain, too, since the phone is now an older and less desirable model.",

    "text": "Currently, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an HTC One M8, having found over the past year that each has its special attributes.  Switching between the two during any given day gives me flexibility and has well prepared me for the LG G4 which has similarity in function of both models.  My last LG phone was about four phones ago and I think this one was worth waiting for.<br /><br />This has a camera with superb options, the ergonomic body design has a mildly contoured back, its removable battery provides enough power to get me through a day without a recharge, it has audio that is better than my Samsung S5 but not as great as my HTC One, the memory can be expanded with an additional microSD card, and its large screen is superb for presbyopic users, especially when the Home buttons are hidden.  The HTC One has prepared me with the double tap option to turn on the screen, but nothing has prepared me for the power and volume button on the rear, creating very smooth and uninterrupted side edges which give a very sleek look to the device.<br /><br />I personally am not dedicated to any one phone manufacturer and upgrade mine every couple of years, generally retaining the last one for use without cell phone service, simply using it for wifi and camera capabilities.  I donate the previous phones to the police department.  The LG G4 is a model that has impressed me very much and I will be purchasing another one as soon as my plan allows replacement of a second line.  I select this over the Samsung S6 for a few reasons which are important to me.<br /><br />* Battery replacement<br />* Sleek design with larger viewable screen<br />* Camera that surpasses all others for using manual and RAW options<br />* Audio that is better even though it is also on the rear of the device<br />* Double tap/swipe on/off<br />* Fits comfortably in a pocket<br />* Very clear audio for phone services, the main purpose I use a smartphone<br /><br />Technical specifications are very clear on this site as well as the LG website, so I will not restate what you likely already know if you are at the point of reading these non-professional subjective reviews.  This phone is regarded as one of the top introductions in 2015 by most.  I expect to see this phone, probably in the leather backed version, very often in television and films, surpassing the Samsung phones I currently notice most frequently.",

It took a minute to find a radio frequency, but once I found one and had it entered by using the up and down buttons on the transmitter, we were listening to Prince through his speakers.  I used Amazon Music as well as Pandora, both were equally as perfect through the speakers in the truck.  Because this has a built in USB port, it's possible to charge my device as it's being used, so I'm not worried about losing power if I'm using my smartphone as a source.  It's nice to be able to use the phone also since the music playback pauses.  The car charger is very solidly built, too, and its fit was very snug.  This is packaged well, too, so it's a good product for gift giving.<br /><br />Something to think about -- since this device requires a radio frequency, be prepared to change the station in your vehicle as well as the transmitter if you're traveling with this.

The HTC audio wins hands down as does its basic appearance, but the Samsung phones are also great.  This black phone is more of a dark gray than true black and the entire case is plastic, giving it a cheaper appearance.  I love the Electric Blue color, but since all phones are protected by case covers, the rears are not visible anyway.  Unlike the HTC, this one offers a removable battery, which along with its superior camera, are why we purchased a pair of these on Verizon Wireless.

    "text": "The Otterbox Commuter Series for HTC One M8 adds weight with substantial protection for my new HTC One.  The little manual describes how to use the case and a separate little sleeve diagrams how to apply the protective clear sheet for the phone screen.  This screen protector is the weakest link for me because nothing I did prevented tiny bubbles from popping up as time passed.  I'ĺl likely remove this soon, but do really like the two part case.  A hard shell snaps onto a rubber encasement with holes included for the camera, usb, audio, and power button.  There is a rubber covering for the volume side button, but the bottom usb and audio port has a moveable thicker plug which can be wiggled into the opening, thereby protecting the slots.  Should you want a lighter weight cover, you can bypass using the hard shell and simply use the rubber sleeve which will do a good job of protecting your investment and still feel good in the hand.  I like this feel better than my other phone's more gel like case, and its clear that this one will last longer because of its better quality.  If you need protection from drops or moisture or you simply want to thicken up your HTC One, I'd definitely consider this one.<br /><br />EDITED 10/13/2014:  The case is holding up well with one exception.  The charging port area has cracked because of the snug area for inserting the cable.  This phone is not a primary one in this household and it's only charged once a week because it is usually powered off.

There was no problem downloading the two free apps.  I don't know that I'd really recommend this product, but because it's being used and enjoyed, I've given it four stars.  Having the capability of attaching it to his high chair or stroller helps preventing the dropping game.",

    "text": "I usually really like Belkin products, but the [[ASIN:B0094CX4NK Belkin View Case / Cover For New Apple iPhone 5 (Purple)]] isn't an incredibly great buy when you consider the price and what it offers.  It's lightweight, easy to apply, and allows the great iPhone 5 to be visible.  Using an iPhone for iPhonography, the Griffin case is much better because the rubber sides are softer, feeling more comfortable in the hands when it's used as a camera.  The color violet is lovely, but be aware that it's only around the edge of the phone.  If you're looking to change the color of your iPhone, look at another case.  Having to push the buttons a little harder isn't an issue, and once the case is attached to the camera, it's not difficult to remove to put your iPhone into another case.  This one will be used irregularly and is not a top choice, but it's a fine backup.",

The [[ASIN:B0069YUO70 Cimo Soft Shell TPU Case for Motorola DROID RAZR Verizon - Red]] was not in the retail packaging, but in a plastic sleeve with a hole ripped out of it larger than an inch square.

Regardless, I believe these cases are absolutely worth a five star review.<br /><br />First impression was that the case was not red, but a bright neon pink.

    "text": "Once I determined that I could not download the updated software for the [[ASIN:B005U5L5OK Parrot Minikit+ Bluetooth Speakerphone - Retail Packaging - Black]], I phoned Parrot tech support.  A very humorous CSR assisted me in rebooting the speakerphone and told me that on a Mac, Safari will not be recognized.  I used Firefox, downloaded the software, dragged it over to the speakerphone, and the phonebook from my smartphone immediately was imported to the speakerphone.  I'd already charged the battery fully, so I was ready to take it down to the car for a test drive.  Attaching to my visor was simple with the clip or additional elastic strap.  Plugging into my power was simple with the included adapter.  I was good to go.<br /><br />I personally am quite adept at understanding various accents and dialects, but I really don't care for the accent on this speakerphone.  I much prefer an \"American\" accent, regardless of the dialect, since I'm in the USA.  The speakerphone turns itself on when movement is felt and turns itself off after a stationary period.  This is a nice feature because I don't remember to turn it off.  When a call comes in, I have to focus to understand the name of the caller and speak very clearly to accept or reject the call.  I can hear the caller pretty clearly and they report that I, too, am understandable, so that's good.  I'm not interested in using this for music because the speakers in my car are superior to the speaker in this product.  I, too, am not interested in using the email functions through this, so I will not review that option.  As a basic speakerphone, this is no better than my Jabra and definitely not as good as the speakerphone in my TomTom GPS.  I'll update this review if I discover more strengths and weaknesses over time.  I can't attest to the longevity because I've only had it for a couple weeks.  For now, I'd give this an average three star review because of the cost.",

Well, she was absolutely right!  The Flat Bungee Office Chair w/ Arms Black is lightweight, made it up the stairs atop my head with no problem.  It's airy and won't gather too much dust.  The five rollers are quality and I don't worry about harming my hardwood floors.  The arms are not adjustable, nor is the rear, but the seat is easily adjusted in height by depressing the handle to the right of the seat.  Guess the manufacturer assumes most customers are right handed.  Because each bungee pair is screwed into the chair by a phillips head screw, I imagine that they would be easy to replace if they ever wear out or have a problem.  I find that by leaning back into the chair, I'm able to work at the computer for hours without a problem and look forward to a long term relationship with the chair.",

    "text": "Basic silicone case in black snaps onto the Apple iPhone 4 without needing much of a stretch.  It's one solid piece, soft and rubbery, adding a little cushion to the case without standing out from the crowd.  The screen protectors are actually a single screen protector which must carefully be applied to the iPod screen because it's a single application that does not lend itself to adjustment.  A plastic squeegee is included for its application and I have many ideas to recycle the adorable Amazon logo imprinted hard card.  If you're talented, you can carve your own little guitar pick.  Set it in a gold bezel and have a one of a kind pendant.  The tiny cloth screen cleaner can be used on your reading glasses so it's not wasted by a single screen cleaning, but whatever you do, be sure to really clean the iPhone screen with this cloth prior to applying the screen protector!  AmazonBasics boasts minimal packaging, so I wonder why a warranty booklet was necessary with this product.  The directions for applying the screen protector were on a small, easy to follow single folded sheet that doesn't take up much space in the recycling bin.  The booklet and box, on the other hand, seemed to be not so necessary.  All in all, this AmazonBasics Silicone Case isn't elegant or even cute, but it should last at least as long as the phone contract and it's reasonably priced.

    "text": "UPDATE (May 2016): When I finally switched to an iPhone last month -- after the THIRD Motorola DROID RAZR M died in a two-year period (basically every 7 1/2 - 8 months, like clockwork), the Verizon tech who was helping me said this model comes back ALL. THE. TIME. Buyer beware.....(End update)<br /><br />I have loved my Motorola Droid phones -- they are the only smartphone I have ever had, even though others have tried to lure me over to the iPhone, but this is ridiculous. I got my first Razr M in April of 2014, as an update when it was time to renew my contract. I liked that it was thinner than the phone I was replacing (a Droid 4), and it seemed to be a great phone overall. Fast forward to January 2015 -- right at eight months -- and it would not even turn off, but neither would it turn ON. I had been having to reboot it multiple times per day, as it kept freezing. One night during a reboot, it got stuck on the start-up screen with the red glowing symbol...and it stayed there until the battery died. If I recharged it, the same thing would happen. So since it was (thankfully) still under warranty, Verizon replaced it. That was January 2015. By early July 2015, I was once again rebooting my phone multiple times a day. Text messages were not always being delivered, the phone did not vibrate for incoming calls when it was on vibrate (so I missed a lot of important calls), and it was generally undependable. I took it in to Verizon and they examined it, telling me to remove a few particular apps and do a factory reset. Ibdid, and within a week, I was back because that had not fixed anything. So in late July 2015, the phone was replaced AGAIN. It is now the end of November -- just four months later -- and this third Razr M is driving me bananas. It reboots itself randomly (sometimes several times a day), I have people telling me they get the same text from me more than once , I find others have sent me texts I never receive, it once again does not vibrate on incoming calls when I have set it to vibrate....I am just DONE. I can understand a phone here and there having problems, but three models of the same phone in less than two years that cannot make it more than eight months before dying? That tells me there is something wrong with the overall design.",

I chose the light purple case, so it probably wouldnt be a problem on the darker ones.<br />The strap comes included, but not attached. It's self adhesive, and stays put. I ended up taking the original strap off and using a different one that was a little bigger and not as sharp at the edges. **So what you see in my picture is not the strap it came with.<br />All-in-all I'd say this is a decent case, especially at the 10.00 price point.",

I have constant issues with MMS messages (which may be the fault of Virgin). Bluetooth is okay, but again it hangs occasionally and sometimes merely turning my head will drop a connection to my Bluetooth headphones (again something that never happened with my former phone and those same headphones). As always, phone comes with a ton of invasive crapware apps. Call quality is okay but variable, but again I don't know if I can blame the phone for this. In all I'll live with it but I'm far from impressed by anything except the price. This said, now I understand the limitations and shortfalls of the phone the price looks at best &#34;reasonable,&#34; and certainly not the &#34;good deal&#34; I'd hoped for.",

I wasn't expecting much because several people stated theirs broke soon after.  I figured a 4 pack would take of that problem and I could replace them every few months if needed.  They are actually much sturdier than I would have expected.  I've had mine on my phone for a couple of months now and I absolutely love it!  I ended up using my spares on my parent's phones so we can all have one.  The ring is so useful to have, not just to hold your phone by but also as a stand.  I use it daily as a stand.  I had a separate iPhone stand I had purchased but now I have one built in with this ring.  You can turn the ring in different directions and pull it out slightly so it acts as a stand.  This ring holder is so wonderful that I hate that I held off for so long to buy it.",

My only complaint, and this is a minor one, is that the case doesn't allow the phone to slide as easily. It's not jagged or anything, just not as smooth as without the case being clipped on.  But, I'm sure that over time and with general wear and tear, sliding the keyboard out will be easier. For now, it's not something I'm concerned about.  I was able to decorate the back of this clear plastic case with Swarovski crystals and it looks FANTASTIC!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a very durable, well fitting, and sylish cover for their phone.  The best part about this case is that it doesn't completely cover your camera lens...so your photos and videos will still come out with amazing quality.",

It is a back plate for some of the Motorola  \"Z series\" phones, which is what I wanted.  It's meant to cover the back of the phone while a Moto Mod is not in use.  It fits my Moto Z3 perfectly and looks nice.  I also have my older phone Z Force, it fits that perfectly as well.  I did try it on a Z4 and it did not fit well, its slightly narrower that the other two phones so the back plate sticks out on the sides by a few millimeters.  The plate's design has a textured feel to it.",

I purchased this particular product because I have a Motorola Droid Z Force and the way the camera is on the back of the phone I didn't want the mount to block it so I can take an occasional video when I ride my bicycle around.  Also the phone is pretty big, especially with the case I have on it and this mount was able to handle the size.  The phone was very secure, I tested it before and after putting the mount on the bicycle by shaking it around.  I am not a mountain biker so I could not attest to its holding strength in that situation.  The quick release button is handy for when you need to grab the phone quickly.  Also you can rotate the phone as needed and its position on the handle bar can be easily changed because of the easy tighten and loosen screw on the mount (no tools needed!).",

No matter how I pushed on and tweaked both the cover and the edges of the screen protector they wouldn't work together.  If I used the phone without the case or maybe a different case that has edges that extend more over the edge of the screen protector it may have worked better.  I didn't try my theory, but when I get around to purchasing a new case for the phone, I will try installing another screen protector, since there was 3 of them in the pack,",

    "text": "I received my Ravelli tripod quickly and in perfect condition.<br /><br />I have used the tripod many times, including in the middle of the night, in a foot of snow to take some long-exposure sky photos. It is very light, has metal legs with rubber feet and plastic components. It has so many different adjustment options that I'm able to set up the camera exactly how I want to.<br /><br />There is a crank lever to allow the threaded center bar to go higher, a large swivel handle that goes up and down and side to side, a hinge type plate to do vertical or angled photos, and of course two levels of leg adjustments. Since there are a lot of adjustment knobs and levers you really have to be aware of what each one does. That way you don't accidentally add too much pressure to an adjuster when it doesn't do what you want it to and breaks. The product is all plastic, so I can see if handled roughly where this could happen. I haven't had any problems though. There are also two bubble gauges to make sure everything is set level.<br /><br />The bag is handy and durable, but since it takes a bit of time to squeeze the tripod in and out of it, I usually do without it. The tripod has a handle on it which makes it easy to carry anyway.<br /><br />I also always just leave the quick release plate attached to my DSLR. It makes for a quicker set-up. If I forget to check if the knob on the bottom of the plate is tight, the camera plate does slowly move downwards if I'm taking vertical photos. I use a Nikon D5100 with an 18-55mm lens and the tripod doesn't have any problem holding it that way... if it's tight. There is also a hook in the center of the tripod which can be used to hold weight for added stability, which a lot of the previous reviewers didn't mention. I haven't needed to use it though.<br /><br />All in all I was happily surprised at the quality and design of the tripod for the price.",

    "text": "I am a perfectionist. I probably spent 20 minutes cleaning and wiping my screen before I even got out the stickers and tape. Why have a bunch of dust on it to begin with?<br /><br />PRODUCT PROS & CON<br />- The front side has plastic handles which make alignment a snap. Also useful if you need to pull up the screen to release a bubble. (Slowly and carefully so you don't break it.)<br />- Fits my screen perfectly very nearly edge to edge. Maybe 1-2 mm difference on the sides. The camera cutout isn't quite centered over the lens, but it's close enough. I tested, and it does not interfere with the camera at all.<br />- Perfectly clear and smooth!<br />- Works great with my Active Pen 2. Maybe even better than without it. IMPRESSED!<br />- ONE con: For a screen this size, there should be more, larger stickers to remove dust. But scotch tape also works well.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL TIPS:<br />- Kimtech delicate task wipers leave no residue and are as close to dustless as paper wipes can be. I use them for my glasses.<br />- Good old clear scotch tape is great for picking up dust, especially around the edges of the screen.<br />- I'm running a HEPA air purifier on turbo to reduce dust in the air. Obviously not necessary, but it reduces dust landing on the screen or protector while your work.<br />- I also check the protector itself for dust after I remove the film in case any static effect draws dust to it.<br />- Work deliberately but not too slowly because dust from the air may settle if you dally.<br />- Use the plastic handles on the front to position perfectly. I worked with the screen upside down and the camera toward me and lined up with the camera then slowly lowered the protector flat.<br />- Run finger from bottom to top of the screen and be patient as seals outward. Leave it alone. Do not help it. If you get any big bubbles, use the handle to pull it back up and the squeegee thing to press them out. Really much easier to lift the screen, but be careful because you don't want to break it.<br />- I had ZERO dust, so I was done at this point. If you have any dust, you can also lift it up again by the handles and use the dust stickers or scotch tape to remove the dust. But be careful you don't add more dust or fingerprints or break the protector.<br /><br />SUPERB! VERY PLEASED!",

It took me three tries and all the protectors to finally attach it in an acceptable manner. However, once applied, this thing is strong and crystal clear. Much clearer than the screen protectors you apply wet, which end up looking foggy.<br /><br />So here's what I learned from the comments that were super helpful.<br /><br />1) Slow down, son. If you rush this, you will muck it up.<br />2) Scotch tape is your new best friend.<br />2.1) If some crap gets stuck to the phone or protector, just pull the protector back and use a round of tape (make a circle with the tape, sticky side out)to remove the offending particle.<br />2.2) Once you get the protector on perfectly, get ready to take the protector's protector off. Redundant, no? Whatevs. Get ready for bubbles to form when you pull the protector's protector off. Stick additional tape to the other side of the protector's protector to reduce bubbles the bubbles that will form if you only use the provided tab to pull (after you read the directions, this might make more sense).<br />2.3) Once the protector's protector is off, if any bubbles remain, stick tape to the actual protector, carefully pull back, and reapply without bubbles. Once you're done, Pull the tape off the protector by peeling it back from the phone side and not the loose tape side. Make this easy on yourself and fold the tape on itself before attaching to the protector so that you have a little handle to grab and don't have to scratch the protector trying to get the final tape off.<br /><br />Once you've done all this, you should have a gorgeous, long-lasting screen protector. Allow yourself at least thirty minutes to do the job, even though it will probably take less time. READ THE OFFICIAL INSTRUCTIONS AND WATCH THE VIDEO ON THE PRODUCT'S WEBSITE BEFORE STARTING.",

It does everything that it's supposed to do and more than exceeded my expectations - I definitely recommend this one and don't bother to look at anything else! I don't want to waste any time going into more details- just read the description online. What I am going to do is add more pictures (in addition to those already posted on other reviews) since ‘a picture is worth a thousand words'. The ONLY other comment/s I will make is to say that I have a classic case of OCD and I can't find ANYTHING that I don't like about this stand! It already comes with the rubber bumper pads on the bottom so it doesn't scratch the surface and I don't need to put them on myself. I also don't like to use my fingers (hate fingerprints!) and always use a stylus instead and this doesn't make it fall over while using it ‘hands free'! The pictures included show how the stand looks and works with a rubber-like back cover protector (which is something I NEVER take off!). So here goes...",

I particularly like the bright colors which helps me to find it in whatever handbag I'm using - it doesn't get ‘lost' in the bottom of the bag like the solid colored ones do. Personally I wouldn't recommend this for a man - it's a bit feminine looking - but to each his/her own. Granted this doesn't come with a pen to write with but I don't see it as a deal breaker. I don't know why this got bad reviews but I have only good things to say! Definitely worth the price - I'd recommend it for any touchscreen device!

Nice tight fit all the way around, thumbprint feature worked great and was able to take lots of pictures, mute button worked great and wrist lanyard was a great feature.  Pretty beefy and rugged. The price was really decent too.<br />The only thing I would have a slight negative say, would be the face cover should be anti-reflective as the glare from the sun and water made it difficult to see the object of my pictures.

    "text": "I paid a few bucks more to purchase from Chubbiestech based on a review and to avoid any problems.  (Reading about the A10 reviews was scaring me until I realized I was reading the wrong product lol.) This is for the Samsung Galaxy S10e. Being from the S- product line,  it's Samsung's flagship product and you can read the history and differences between the models on Wikipedia. I found this information very helpful.<br /><br />I lucked out with the right Seller and got a phone that really seems brand new and works excellent in every way.  (A previous purchase of a different model and seller was excellent in every way but then we discovered it wouldn't charge.) I'm so happy I bought this!<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Mine was in new condition without a scratch,  and functions perfectly in every way.  I was able to load SmartSwitch on my old J7 and only had to manually download a matching icon set (and create a new Samsung account to download it.) Everything else (including my custom wallpaper from an outside source)  transferred exactly.<br /><br />I wanted a smaller profile/screen because I really loved my J7 and can easily operate it with one hard.  I find modern phones too large and heavy and I'm not a gamer. The S10e's profile is surprisingly *smaller* than the J- series and fit my desire.  Could easily fit inside a shirt pocket.<br /><br />It runs way faster than my old phone and I verified with DevCheck that it does indeed have 6 Gigs of Ram. That's more than I ever had before and so it seems real speedy and capable to me and also 128 Gigs of space is way more than I ever thought of using.<br /><br />I mostly only use my  phone as a music source and the sound quality thru my headphones is superb,  like my J7 which I prefer to the modern soundboards that I have to tweak; I don't have to use the equalizer on this and the bass is great.<br /><br />The Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,  screentouch and call quality (and charging)  all work great.  The mobile data connection on my old sim for some reason is much faster (30M??) on 4GLTE and the upload speed is 3x my old phone too, I can't imagine why.  But the connection with the same service is just stronger and has much better coverage.  I didn't realize it was the old phone limiting it.  That's like broadband over 4G lol.<br /><br />I simply slipped in my old Sim and it connected with no problem or troubleshooting.<br /><br />Anyway the S- series hardware of this phone is superb.  Mine came with Android 12 which I understand is the highest available for this model.  My J7 was stuck in Android 8. I didn't want to upgrade to a phablet nor pay a lot for features I didn't want to begin with.<br /><br />Caveats/Tips<br /><br />I never used a case before but this phone is so small (yay!) AND slippery I needed to buy a case. Don't want to drop it and scratch the screen because my big clumsy fingers can't hold onto it.  I don't have a problem navigating the screensize.<br /><br />Had to manually customize icons after installing everything. This requires a Samsung account. (You can delete it from Accounts afterward if you wish.)<br /><br />If you use Smart Switch to transfer and duplicate your experience from your old phone you need to unpair the devices listed under Bluetooth and re-pair them for them to work on your new phone.<br /><br />Many/Most of your programs transferred and websites will require you to log-in again (so you'll need your passwords) but the data (pics/docs/program files) transferred without a hitch. (You can download Smart Switch on your old phone from Google Play.)<br /><br />My phone has the annoying T-mobile start-up screen (less annoying if you turn the sound off) but it doesn't harm anything functionally.<br /><br />Samsung apps preinstalled cannot be uninstalled or disabled. However Google apps can be.<br /><br />The battery is small (3100) but I'm used to that from the J7. I tried a larger capacity battery in my J7 but became impatient with the charging time so actually prefer the quick charging of these.<br /><br />This review is obviously for folks who may not have done this before or are doubtful about the quality of the renewed product.<br /><br />I'm totally happy with the new phone and the process of setting it up was seamless. Definitely worth it and you saved a lot of money! (Now you can peruse the internet and modern apps like the Joneses! :)<br /><br />Update:  It's a bit too small to be honest,  and very SLIPPERY, however still prefer this to the large ones.  Wish they still made J-size. But everything works great,  sounds great and I'm getting 50M download on LTE! All I do is listen to music so it's fine for my needs.  Great price for a fast phone.",

Hotspot, tethering,<br />Wi-Fi Calling all work fine on Qlink. It's not the phone,  your carrier restricts these functions.  If anything comes up,  I'll update. You can download and use Google keyboard/swype typing instead of Samsung. I've used Samsung and particularly the J7 line for years,  if you're happy with those,  you'll be happy with this.  It's the same, new version with 5G. Just buy it.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Samsung forced software update and now my speed is capped at 5Mbs. In effect the purpose of getting a 5G phone is negated.

    "text": "Althought I wanted a white one (I bought a hard-shell case for color), this is simply the best cellphone I have ever had, and I will never want to trade it in when I have to for something... lesser. I'm aging and eye-sight is diminishing, and only this phone (6'3&#34; screensize) is big enough for me to easily read. It's my first modern &#34;smartphone&#34;, and although I was intimidated and there's a little learning curve for newcomers to &#34;smartphones&#34;, this &#34;phablet&#34; (phone & tablet :) is simply the best and has all the features and functionality I want. I am *so* pleased (and relieved) with it! I had to go with AT&T because they're the only carrier I could get this phone with, but they upgraded it to 4G-LTE and modern software so it was worth it. It updates itself a lot and I have turned off a few programs in application settings. You can also set data limits in the phone itself which helps since AT&T doesn't have an unlimited (4G) data plan. Only video will run it up that high however. I was watching television from China in the park with my dog! 4G-LTE is almost like having Wi-Fi on-hand everywhere you go! Again, set your data limits. It is truly an enjoyable phone with countless features, and I'm happy I held out for this model and large-size screen. Totally worth it. :) Tip:  Make sure it comes from Amazon activated before you open the box (see my review on a different Amazon/Carrier cellphone experience and beware). Note that only a carrier-activated phone of this model will be updated with 4G-LTE (hopefully), the unlocked models on Amazon are 2-G/3-G only!",

If you have a phone case, it  snugly fits around the phone and the pressure pushes the screen protector off a tiny bit so feels like there is a slighttttt air gap which makes typing hard. You can hear it snap into place sometimes when you type.<br />2. Have to press the screen harder. Kinda annoying while typing. I took the case off so I didnt have to type as hard. But its still harder than if I had no screen protector.<br />Note: I didn't see an option for Overall Screen Sensitivity on the S8 (on my Verizon-locked phone) like how some video how-tos showed. I did see a Touch Sensitivity setting for just the Home Button, but that didnt help much.<br /><br />I heard non-tempered glass solutions work much better like by IQShield, will try that soon (or expensive 'Whitestone' glass protectors)",

I also put in the other pocket the credit card I will use for shopping and a mini bottle of hand sanitizer.

The purse comes with 2 straps, a wrist strap, and an cross body strap.  The material is plastic, so can spray disinfectant and not worry about ruining the material.<br />The one thing that does not work through the clear plastic is the retina scan for the phone, so you will need to enter your password or pattern to unlock your phone while in your purse.

    "text": "This is an OK protection for your iPhone X.<br />The case is solid and easy to install. It will probably provide adequate protection. Somewhat bulky.<br />Installation of the glass protector was relatively easy with the included excellent alignment tool. You may get a large air bubble that you will have to quickly squeeze out.<br />Here is the bad -  When the bottom/top is perfectly aligned - the top &#34;ears&#34; that go around the notch are short by about 1/20 of an inch. You will see a color strip at the top/bottom of the screen when the screen is white. Its annoying...<br />Don't try to realign the glass protector - even if you are extremely careful - It does not help and it is very likely that it will not stick to the screen.<br />Returning due to no response from customer support. I hope they make the screen protector larger.<br />I purchased this protector: [[ASIN:B074GWQMRS iPhone X Screen Protector, [2-Pack] ESR [Force Resistant Up to 22 Pounds] iPhone X Tempered Glass, Case Friendly for iPhone X iPhone 10 5.8-inch 2017 released version]] and this case:[[ASIN:B074CMWM9H Spigen Liquid Air Armor iPhone X Case with Durable Flex and Easy Grip Design for Apple iPhone X (2017) - Matte Black]]",

This is a starter smartphone for me as don't have one currently. I didn't want to spend a lot for a phone that I may not like, so thought this was really good value, & had good reviews.  The dual SIM was a big selling point for traveling, along with being unlocked.  It uses regular size SIMS, but if you had a mini or micro, could use a SIM adapter.  I got the blue one, & love the color, along with the blue case that came with it.  Screen protector that came with it wasn't good, couldn't get the bubbles out at all, so had an extra thick tablet one, cut it down to fit & that works great.  It is a fingerprint magnet without a protector.  Battery life was fine, charge once a day at most if you use heavily otherwise in standby will last a few days.  I got a 32GB card to extend the memory & moved some of my games to it to save phone storage (yes you can do it on this version of Android).  It seemed bigger than I imagined, even though I had the dimensions, & was torn on whether I wanted a smaller device, but makes sense to be bigger for ease of games etc, & now I'm used to it, I actually love it.  I did a lot of research on phones to see which one would work best for me since I'm a newbie to the smartphone world, & I'm really grateful to the other reviews which helped me choose this. I'm glad I picked it & have no regrets so far.",
