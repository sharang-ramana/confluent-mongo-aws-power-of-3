The seller was honest, which is more important to the cheap-skate than the price! The phone was box-ready, meaning the moment we took it out of the box it was ready for use. We dialed up our carrier, activated the phone, and my son was snapchatting within moments of the package delivery. Thankyou for the HONESTY!

There is a ballpoint pen inside the barrel so be cautious about that. If you notice tip fraying then, don't keep using it.

    "text": "I went by the title which said it was contained survival items and could be used as a pill container. I chose this dark green one only because I liked the color the best. When I got it I thought there isn't any room for pills unless you remove the survival items so I guessed (wrongly) that is why it was advertised as a pill container. But when I just went back to the webpage, I noticed that some of the items looked different. That was when I realized there were 2 different items! You can get the one with the survival kit OR you can get one to use as a pill container. I don't know how the size differs. The survival one and the pill one comes in orange or black. Also, this darker forest green has the survival kit and the light neon green is for pills. I'm thinking about putting the survival kit in my knife which has a handle I can unscrew and put things in. Then I'm going to see how many of my pills will fit in this one. I know it won't be as many since there is the side which is kind of cut back (as you can see in this photo). But since it has good feedback for being water resistant (it has an extra O-ring), I will see if I can put some pills my version after taking the survival kit out.<br /><br />Since the survival cut version and the pill version, I would go with the survival version since they are the same price and this version has a rough pad inside you can strike a match on which is handy and you do get the extra items. The pill version is more straight (no curves like this one) and is empty though it also comes with the ring to put a lanyard on and an extra O-ring).<br /><br />Since it is coming overseas, don't expect it right away (so no 2-day delivery Prime members)! I ordered it on January 6th (after the Christmas rush) and it arrived on January 30th.",

One thing I forgot to mention is that in the back of it (what you see in its picture), there is a piece of plastic that folds out and serves as a stand when the phone is in a landscape position. I've used that a few times to watch a show on my phone.<br /><br />Since it has been 3+ years now since I bought it, there were several more times that I accidentally dropped my phone.

There are two parts.. The inner skin is a soft flexible rubber. The only down side to this is that it does not fit super tight at the top and bottom of the phone.. However this is by no means a deal breaker because it is much easier to remove than the hard plastic inner skin of the other cover I own.<br />The outer plastic shell fits securley over the skin and it feels quite comfortable in my hand with almost no bulk.<br />All the openings seem good and are large enough to accommodate. They could be trimmed with a sharp instrument too if need be. I read that others did that.<br />Overall I would recommend this case and may purchase another color. My case is the green/gray.

I hooked it on the air vent. The only problem i have is that i may have to add a second magnet plate at the back of my phone (provided) because with the one plate the phone dangles around or slips off if i hit a bump or touch it which can be very annoying. I think it will be more sturdy with 2 plate at the back of the phone instead of 1.",

Anyway, imagine my disappointment when she hands me my phone with a big crack across its face. However, what appeared to be a crack was a crack or a scratch in the ballistics glass. I'm pretty sure it saved my phone from being cracked. In need of a new screen protector, I cheaped out and bought the Tech Armor HD Clear screen protector 3-pack from Amazon. I see why they come in a 3-pack: you will ruin 2 screen protectors before placing one on well enough to be satisfied with. It also doesn't seem to offer a lot of protection.

Dad catches his phone about once a year, sometimes twice if he's got weather that permits a lot of time on his 'farm toys'.

(Probably didn't have to mention the was a Baby Boomer with all the indications in that last sentence - lol) He saw a PopSocket) on my sister's and niece's iPhones and I guess banked it in his memory. When Mom gave Daddy a new iPhone XR with the bigger screen we knew he needed the OtterBox case - he's out there practically 4x4'ing in his big D53 dozer and his phone stays put in the holster, clipped to his belt. Anyway, because his new phone is much bigger than his old 6, he was having trouble - even with his big manliest man hands - holding the phone with one hand. He asked me to get him \"what your sister and Emily\" have and I did and it is perfect. He can still holster his phone soundly, and it helps him hold it like a champion while he's walking around and talking on speakerphone. So easy to apply the popsocket I wasn't even asked to do it for him!",

    "text": "With the Samsung Galaxy 8 Plus it was hard to find Screen Protectors that fit and stayed on. They were not going to help if they were just popping off for no reason. I tried and returned several before buying iAnder.<br /><br />iAnder does everything it promises and exceeds my expectations! Proper fit, stays on, very durable, great price, love the 2 pack, screen is not affected by touch or halo/shadow like others, and comes with cleaning kit and installation tray.<br /><br />Im very hard on phones!<br />Ive dropped my phone face down on gravel. I couldnt tell if the phone screen was cracked underneath the shattered protector that was still attached firmly. I had to remove the protector that still had great adhesion, but was still held together even though completely shattered.  I didnt have to worry about being cut, the protector comes off in 1 piece .My phone was still perfectly fine!!<br /><br />I had one protector that after each fall would have a small crack by the edge,  but I didnt replace it until after the 6th fall when the crack was across the screen and I could no longer see the screen.  But even with small cracks, it never affected the touch or view.<br /><br />First thing is, Protectors vary, so follow the installation instructions.  Comes with cleaning kit, installation tray, and has easy and thorough instructions. I place a new protector at night. I place phone  on flat sturdy surface, turn off my phone so that the glass is not being jostled by vibration, getting dirt and lint from hands and pockets etc. The next morning, put on the case and go. This always helps the adhesion process.<br />If you need to have your phone on, turn off vibrate, try to let the phone sit for a while without being moved around.<br /><br />EDIT- 11/8/2019  I just purchased these again. I have one from last time, but ots hiding from me so I ordered more.  Again, my phone was dropped often, on tile, gravel,  concrete etc. This time not only was the screen area cracked here and there, but there were 3 yes 3 big cracks on the negative edge (round part where glass ends on outer edge) that splintered out, up and down. I was sure it was my phone that was cracked and not just the protector. I could still use the phone with zero problems even with the cracks. I dreaded removing the protector and seeing a damaged phone. I had to use muscle to get protector off , and had to clean the phone well to remove some adhesive left behind,  but my phone is fine! I could not believe it!<br /><br />This protector saved my phone even when I dropped it and it hit cement and gravel face down, on the side and edge of phone 3 times. Thats not including the countless other falls/drops, But those 3 were hard crashes! I honestly thought the entire phone would shatter on those.<br /><br />Im on my 4th package of protectors. The average person would likely be on their first package. Like I said before,  I am very very rough on phones.<br /><br />This protector is great! Its Saved my phone from literally, hundreds of falls.<br />Highly recommend",

It's good to have the right cord for the specific electronic and a cord that cannot get lost, while also keeping things organized when you have a large number of devices to charge and this is where a charging station like this one can help.<br /><br />The best feature of this charging station is that it includes cords to accommodate different electronics, and that includes apple and Samsung. It takes a little assembly effort to get it ready, but once you're finished, the slots are ready to handle your different electronics. The apple and usb cords make it efficient in this manner.<br /><br />This charging station does seem to charge a little faster than using our usual cords, so that is a plus. If you happen to live where power surges are commonplace, I recommend plugging it into a surge strip. It's best not to take chances, especially if you have a large number of items plugged in.<br /><br />I like what I have experienced with this charging station. The only issue I have with the slots is that some electronics are too tall to fit. My ipad is one such item. Other than this annoyance, this charging station from Catlyn is good for households with varied electronics, since it helps charge many different devices at once and keeps things organized.",

To keep the iPad going strong, I decided to get this Galvanox PPS GaN Charger.<br /><br />This charge is like most others. The cord itself is detachable from the head of the plug, which means you can leave the head inserted into a socket, unplug the cord itself, and use it elsewhere. We often do this when we charge electronics in the car.<br /><br />You do get reasonably fast charging with this cord. With our ipad, it charges it at the rate of about 2 to 3 percent per minute, which is more than fast enough to meet our charging needs. I tend to leave charging cords plugged in, but if you need to unplug and store, just roll it up and place it in a drawer until your next use.<br /><br />With the proliferation of electronics, it is important to have the means to change readily available. This Galvanox Charger is quite good at its intended task and it earns an easy recommendation from me.",

It took only about 30 minutes to add those other 20 percentage points of charge, which is a pretty good rate of charge overall. And for charging your phone, it uses about 35 percent of its power to charge my phone all the way, from zero to 100 percent, which again is good.<br /><br />I love having a digital readout on a phone charger because I know precisely how much juice remains. This power bank is cool for another reason: It has a pull- out stand, on which you can place your phone while it charges, for easy viewing.<br /><br />This charger is smaller than most others but don't let the size fool you. SAFUEL has put great effort into this phone charger, showing that it is a market leader in this type of technology. It's a handy, practical charging device and one you don't want to leave home without.",

No one wants to get caught with a phone that has lost its charge and, luckily, there are power banks ready to step in when needed. Manufacturers keep getting better and better with power banks and an excellent choice is this SAFUEL Power Bank.<br /><br />Straight from the package, this power bank already has a good deal of available charge, so you can use it immediately. It has a digital display which is far superior to the power banks of old, most of which indicated the available power by displaying either one, two, three, or four bars of light which forced you to guess. There is no doubt how much power remains with this power bank. The percentage is right there, before your eyes.<br /><br />This is a fast- charging power bank. From my own tests, I found that it takes about 17 minutes to add 10 percentage points of charge. So, at that rate, the power bank can be charged completely in about 2.5 to 3 hours. It charges phones quickly also. Plug your phone into this power bank and you will find that, for a smartphone like I have, it takes about 3 percent of the power bank to add 10 percent to the phone. That's a ratio of about three to one, which means this power bank, when fully charged, can completely charge three smartphones like mine.<br /><br />We need our electronics for work and to stay connected. We cannot afford to have our electronics lose their power and this power bank from SAFUEL is ready to make sure you have the power when you need it most. It charges quickly and keeps your phone or other device going for the duration.",

You can't take a chance on your electronics losing power and a device that is ready to keep you safe is this SAFUEL Portable Charger.<br /><br />I have used many portable chargers in my day but SAFUEL ranks among the very best for several reasons. I like the flat, slim design. It is shaped like a smartphone and that means it is easily portable in the same way that a smartphone is easily portable. You can fit this in your pants pocket, in the outside of a backpack, even in your shirt pocket without any problem. Next, I like the digital readout. With some portable chargers, all you get is a set of four bars to tell you how much power remains. With this, you know precisely what percentage of power is available. It also comes with its own USB cable and travel pouch.<br /><br />The above qualities are certainly good, but what matters most is the charging ability. I have a Samsung smartphone and, putting this charger to the test, I found that the charge ratio is about 3 to 1. What I mean is that my smartphone could be charged up to 30 percent using only 10 percent of the available charge on this SAFUEL Portable Charger. That means if the SAFUEL is 100 percent charged, I could charge my smartphone completely, three times, and still have power to spare.<br /><br />And this charger gets the job done in a relatively short time. With each passing minute, my smartphone gained two percentage points of charge. So, at that rate, my smartphone would be charged completely in about 50 minutes. Excellent numbers, especially compared to other portable chargers I have used.<br /><br />We need electronics and we need to make sure they remained powered throughout the day, wherever we go.  With this SAFUEL Portable Charger, I have the extra juice available when I need it and I can continue about my day without worry. It's one of the best I have ever used and one I recommend.",

    "text": "Cell phones are great for many reasons and while we know we shouldn't use them while we drive, sometimes, we must do this, like when opening up a map and trying to follow it. To be safe, a phone mount is essential, and a good choice is this cell phone mount, made by Tronwin.<br /><br />My greatest problem with cell phone mounts is that they tend to not hold themselves in place. This is my number one demand when I purchase a cell phone mount for a car: It must be the type that clips on or otherwise grips in a way that it won't fall off. Mounts that use suction cups are the worst. Clip on are best and this mount scores highly in this area. It clips to the air vent, and it holds firmly in place.<br /><br />This cell phone mount can hold just about any cell phone, regardless of its size. You just push the button to move the sides out, place your phone between, and the squeeze together. To release your phone, just push the button in the back once again. You can pull the base down, too, if necessary to make your phone fit.<br /><br />Another cool thing about this cell phone mount is that it can be moved around most any way you like. Other mounts will come loose if you try to move them too much. But with this mount, it can be moved to just the right angle. You can even turn it sideways, if you prefer to view your cell phone that way.<br /><br />Cell phones are a regular part of life. This cell phone mount from Tronwin is an excellent choice for all the reasons stated above. It stays secure and offers extra movement not possible with other mounts.",

A good option is this iPhone Charger Fast Charging Data Sync Transfer Cord with USB Wall Charger Travel Plug, made by Belcompany.<br /><br />With this charger, you get a pair of cords/plugs. This is nice, because you instantly have a spare that you can take with you to work, leave in your car, etc. Charging cords are easy to lose so it's nice to have a pair of them.<br /><br />This charging cord will juice up an iPhone from near zero to one hundred percent in about 40 minutes. That means, with each 2- 3 minute period of charge, your phone will gain one percent. This is good speed and I like that the cord is over three feet in length. It is long enough that you can plug it into a nearby outlet and still be able to hold and use your phone.<br /><br />Keeping cell phones charged and ready to go is important. This package pair of charging cords from Belcompany is a good one overall. It gets phones charged in reasonable time and its practical design makes it useful for everyday needs.",

I'm normally fine with putting things in my pocket while I walk, but if I'm jogging, cycling, etc it can get uncomfortable. A good alternative to shorts pockets is this Cell Phone Armband with Airpods Bag Running Armband from Haissky<br /><br />To use this, you just wrap it around your arm and hold in place with the Velcro. If your arm is smaller than average, you can adjust it to fit. The emphasis seems to be on using this for iphones, but it can be used with other smartphones also.<br /><br />The best thing about this armband is that it is slick to the touch and moisture repellant, so it keeps you feeling cool. And with it on your arm, it doesn't restrict movement. It's also nice that it has a separate pocket to hold your keys, spare change, and so on, plus a slot for cards. Bear in mind, however, that the pocket isn't that big- it's too small to hold a full wallet, for example. But you can easily fit your credit card and a little bit of cash or coin in the pocket, so that should be sufficient.<br /><br />With the preponderance of electronics, we need to have a place to store them. This armband is a good item for this purpose. It keeps your cellphone up and out of the way when you exercise and it's comfortable to wear.

    "text": "We all know the importance of keeping our electronics charged and ready for use. Electronics are a fact of life and it is important that we keep enough charge to make sure they don't run out of juice when we need them most. An easy way to keep electronics charged is through a wireless charging station, like this OCOMMO 4 in 1 Wireless Charging Pad.<br /><br />I have another wireless charging station, but mine is only good for one phone at a time and nothing more. With this charging station, you have space for two cell phones plus UBS ports where you can plug in and charge up to two more devices. This means the station can charge up to four items at once, which is great for those who have a lot of different electronics. Also, not every electronic is capable of wireless charging, but with the two USB, this isn't a problem, since you can plug the other items in, as needed.<br /><br />My kids have more than just cell phones, so I know that they can use a device like this. My older daughter loves this- she can charge her phone wirelessly, next to her bed, and easily reach for it and remove it from the stand as needed, without having to mess with a cord. The wireless action charges just as quickly as using a cord- she told me there is no difference. Again, the advantage with this charging station is that you can charge four items at the same time. And since it is flat in design, it is easy to take anywhere with you.<br /><br />Electronics need constant charging and this OCOMMO 4 in 1 Charging Pad is an efficient way to keep your electronics juiced up and ready to go. It's an item that makes a great gift for the teen or adult who owns multiple electronics.",

    "text": "Navigating from place to place is now easier than ever before thanks to the internet and the many mapping functions that exist. It's so easy to enter a destination and have the route laid out before you, complete with directions, but it's not always easy to see your phone, since it usually involves looking down. A positive solution to this problem is the DM Cell Phone Holder for Car.<br /><br />This cell phone holder mounts to your vehicle vents and is secured with a clip. The ball- like twist lock makes it easily movable so that you can adjust it in different directions for the best viewing angle.<br /><br />DM Cell Phone holder is the third such cell phone holder I have owned and it ranks as a good one overall. For me, the definitive qualities of a good cell phone holder are its ability to stay secure and its ability to easily release your phone when you're finished using it. With the security, this one is pretty good. I was fortunate because  the clip barely fit around the flaps of the vents in my truck. If the thickness had been any greater, it wouldn't have worked.<br /><br />With the release, this one is good, but it took time to get used to. With my other cell phone holders, the release was achieved by pushing a button on the back. With this holder, you have to grip the bottom prong and pull it downward to release. Not knowing this at first, I got frustrated and pulled it off the air vent completely before being able to remove. Now that I understand better how it works, everything is fine.<br /><br />This holder is designed for thin phones and its triangular orientation is made to hold your phone vertically. I like what I have experienced with this holder so far and I recommend it for those who, like me, prefer to see directions on their cell phone screen while they drive and prefer the safety of keeping their phone closer to windshield level for viewing.",

    "text": "Charging one's electronics is an ongoing need. This sounds simple enough, but when you're driving and several family members all start clamoring about the need for more percentage points on their cell phone charge gauge, you could have a real problem. The solution?- a multiple port charging system like the Wishinkle 5 Ports Multi Passenger Car Charger.<br /><br />This car charger is designed to charge several devices from a single cord. You plug it into your car's socket, and then plug your electronics cords into any one of the 5 ports. The ports are identical, with the exception of the electrical capabilities: 2.4 amps for the two front ports, 2 amps for the three back ports. Just plug in the cord and let the charging begin.<br /><br />The cord for this charger is about 5 feet in length and easily its best quality is the fact that it has ports on both ends. Most multi- port chargers have the ports in one place, right next to where you plug the cord into your car socket. This can make it a challenge sometimes to stretch cords from the back seat to the front, and it can make it difficult for the backseat passengers to continue to use their devices while the charging is taking place because the backseat passengers may not be able to reach. These problems are solved with the Wishinkle charger. The backseat passengers have three ports right there, nearby. They can charge and still use their device with no problem.<br /><br />We use this cord in our SUV and it has made our lives much better. The back part of the cord has a clip and we just attach it to the pocket on the backside of either of our front seats. With this type of arrangement, we just leave the cord permanently plugged in and clipped to the back of the seat. Now, anytime someone needs a charge, they can easily take care of things. They don't have to say a word.<br /><br />Electronics are here to stay and the need to keep our electronics charged and ready to go is a constant need. The Wishinkle 5 Ports Multi Passenger Car Charger is the solution to our family charging needs and it's a practical device we are thrilled to have.",

I spend a good deal of time in my car and occasionally, I need an added boost for my cell phone, just to be safe. Therefore, a car charger is an important accessory and a good option for this everyday need is AmazonBasics Car charger 15 watt USB- C Port, 12 watt USB- A Port.<br /><br />This car charger has two different ports and that means you can charge two different electronics at the same time. The ports are USB-C and USB-A, so they are different in size and thus can accommodate different electronics. It is important to make sure this fits your needs before you make a purchase. If your electronics require the same size port, then you won't be able to charge more than one item at a time.<br /><br />With this charger, you just plug it into your car's cigarette lighter. You will see a small blue light to indicate that the charger is delivering the juice and is ready for use. It charges at a fast rate. From my experience, with my Samsung cell phone, I have found that this device charges at a rate of about 2 percent each minute. So, doing the math, that means it will charge a completely dead phone all the way to the 100 percent level in about 50 minutes. This is fast enough to easily suit my car charging needs.<br /><br />AmazonBasics makes many reliable products and I have had good experiences with all of them thus far. The AmazonBasics Car charger 15 watt USB- C Port, 12 watt USB- A Port gets the job done and can charge two different electronics at once. It is convenient and delivers the extra power you need, when you need it.",

    "text": "With as much time as I spend driving and as much as I use my cell phone's navigation system, it is imperative that I have some way to keep my cell phone safely visible. A cell phone holder is the obvious solution to the concern and a very good choice is the Baseus Car Vent Cell Phone Holder.<br /><br />My first experience with a cell phone holder was one of the types that attaches itself to the dash. These phone holders rely on suction cups and/or adhesive to stay in place and my experience with them has been negative overall mainly because they tend to loosen up and fall over, often with minimal touching or pressure. I knew that a car vent style holder was better and that is what convinced me to get this device from Baseus.<br /><br />This cell phone holder clips to your car vent and it comes with two different clipping attachments. One of them has legs, the other does not. I found that the one with legs takes more effort to attach and it appears that this is due to the fact that the round ball is a little larger with the one with legs, making it more difficult to screw the nut into place. The other attachment, without the legs, attaches more securely.<br /><br />With its flat backing, this cell phone holder helps protect against excessive hot or cold air coming from your car vent and affecting your cell phone. This was a concern of mine, because I know that when my cell phone overheats, it loses power quickly. The backing on this holder provides a barrier and keeps your phone from getting hit directly by the air coming from the vent.<br /><br />This holder remains secure while I drive and it hasn't popped loose even once. I like that there is sufficient room to plug in my cord without any interference and I like that I can reach for my phone, touch the screen, and press buttons without worry. To remove your phone from the holder, all you have to do is press the release button. Functionally, it works well and you can even turn your phone sideways if you like without any problem, thanks to the design.<br /><br />Car vent mounted cell phone holders are the way to go and this model from Baseus is a very good one for those of us who use our phone frequently for navigation. I did have the one issue with the attachment with legs not fitting very well, but the other attachment works just fine and it keeps my phone securely in place while I drive. It's a good cell phone holder for the money and I continue to use it each day.",

    "text": "Most every person in the modern world has a cell phone and if your cell phone gets a workout due to the demands of your job or some other reason, then regular charging is a must. But what if you are not close to a power source and your phone is almost completely drained? It is these times that a portable charger is needed and an excellent choice for the task is the Power Bank Portable Charger.<br /><br />Flat and slim in design like a cell phone itself, this charger is ready to accommodate. It has two input ports: A micro USB and a Type C port, which are used for charging the charger itself with the short, included cord. It has two output ports so it is possible that you can charge two items at the same time. I use an android phone and to charge my phone, I plug into one of these two, larger output ports and then plug my regular charger cord into the bottom of my android phone, using my own charging cord.<br /><br />Power Bank Portable Charger is far superior to other, similar charging devices I have used and the reason is the amount of power this baby holds! I love that this charger shows you the percentage of power remaining, taking away the guesswork, and I love how long it lasts and how much can be charged. Showing the percentage of power remaining is a great thing to know and it makes me wonder why other manufacturers of similar devices have not yet done something like this. It's about time that manufacturers have added this crucial piece of information to their technology.<br /><br /> Anyway, let's go back to the charging ability because this is the device's strongest point. I tested it using my own android phone and I found that the charging ratio is about 3.5 to one. What this means is that, for each 1 percent of charge that goes away from the charger, my phone's charging percentage increases by 3.5 percent. Or, to put it in simpler terms, if my phone was completely dead and this charger was at 100 percent, I could plug it in and once my phone was completely charged, this charger would still have about 70 percent of its charge remaining! That means you could charge three phones completely, using this charger, and still have charge left to use for another phone. This is vastly superior to other portable chargers I have used over the years. I also found that, using this charger, my phone will increase its percentage of charge at the rate of just over one percentage each minute. So, I can go from zero to, say, 20 percent charged in about 17 minutes, which is a faster pace than other chargers I have used.<br /><br />This charger packs a lot of juice and it's long lasting, but to reach 100 percent charge on the charger itself, I have found that it does take many hours. Remember- this charger has a larger amount of storage than others, so it should be expected that it would take a long time.  I haven't tried plugging it into my computer to charge it- I have only plugged it into the wall, inserting the large end of the included, short cord into the head of my existing cell phone charge cord. Thus, I cannot speak for how fast it would charge if I did it using a computer, but I assume it would be about the same. So, if you know you're going to need this charger and you plan to use it all day, possibly even allowing others to share it and charge their phone, too, you need to start charging the charging many hours before you need it. On the other hand, if you are the only person who plans to use it, then you don't need to worry. Like I said, based on my tests with my own phone, I would need the charger to be only about 30 percent charged in order to charge my phone completely, from zero to 100 percent. Oh, and whatever you do, make sure to test everything first to make sure the cords fit properly. I found that the included, short cord is fine for charging this charger, but I cannot use it to charge my own phone because the small end of the included cord will not fit into the base of my phone. Thus, I need to take my own, longer charging cord along wherever I go, plugging one end into my phone and the larger USB end into the charger.<br /><br />When you use your cell phone for work, you could use up power quickly and a portable charger is a must. The Power Bank Portable Charger is the best one I have used so far. It has the ability pack the juice, giving you peace of mind and completely assurance that it will be able to charge your cell phone when you need it. Add to that the digital readout that shows how much power remains and you have everything you need for a successful day of cell phone usage.",

Callers could not hear me well, etc.  What I really like about the Avantree is that I can put it on my visor and it is close to my mouth, so my voice sounds good to people with whom I am speaking.  I also like being able to voice control my phone and get the responses on the Avantree speaker.  Also, battery life is excellent!! I had one small problem with the unit and Avantree support was able to help me resolve it, and was extremely responsive in the process.  If you need Bluetooth for your car and don't want to have to replace your radio or keep the Bluetooth unit plugged in, this is a steal!!!",

The guy I bought it from had a magnet mount holder for his phone that was mounded to the dash and he used the something old school for the music from his phone. So I bought something else and his phone was smaller and the magnet wouldn't hold my 7+ so I bought a Humixx ring holder for my case and this mount. Well I so wanted this mount to work as I don't care for the vent ones and my car vents are elongated and we live in FL, air is not something you want to block. So I used wipes they sent and followed the directions and the first one lasted 3 days. So started over and the second in didn't last a day.<br /><br />However, I wrote to the company and told them my dilemma and even though I didn't want the vent clip, I agreed to try it. They sent it to me free and were great about responding and making things right. I will say their magnets I found to be the strongest. I'll keep it till I get a new phone and then we'll see, but I would use Humixx again for sure!",

It is glass after all. If the case breaks but your phone is  not damaged then as far as I'm concerned the case did it's job. If you want a hardcore case that stands everything then get one of those.

Dirt gets between the phone and the case all the time, and I mean all the time. This makes it look bad but more importantly has the potential to scratch the phone if not cleaned regularly.<br />The case also gets scratched very easily but I guess that's somewhat expected from a clear plastic case.<br />My biggest problem is with the buttons on the side of the phone. The case I received is not like the ones in the product picture. The area where the mute and volume buttons are is not open like the top and the bottom of the phone. Instead, case has tiny openings just for the buttons. This makes it almost impossible to use the buttons unless you use your nails. Using the mute switch is even harder. If you use these buttons on a regular basis then don't buy this case otherwise it will drive you crazy.<br /><br />**update**<br />After my review, the seller send me what they called an \"updated\" version for free. This is a new case and doesn't have the issues the previous one does. This case is great and I would recommend it to everyone. Customer service was great too. Thanks.",

The harder shell becomes brittle over time, which makes it easily chip off chunks of material.  The design is a two-piece system with two types of material, a grippy plastic shell, and a rubbery liner that fits into the shell.  The rubber part is great, but isn't the concern, it's the hard liner that has lost 1&#34; of material on both edges that has me concerned.<br /><br />Right now I'm shopping for another case, and I don't think I'll get another Incipio if I can expect this in the future.<br /><br />I don't drop my phone very often, so in case you're wondering this case survived for about 9 months before it started losing the corners.  Not bad for the $15 I paid Nov '12...but I'd still rather have something that lasts the life of the phone to keep it protected...especially after shelling out this much money for a phone!<br /><br />If you rarely drop your phone, this is still very good for the money.  I haven't tried others yet so I cannot advise on one vs. another.  But if you drop your phone regularly (not me), then I cannot recommend this case.  One of the good merits to this case though is that it does adequately protect the front/screen...some cases are so slim (e.g. Ringke Slim), that if you drop it flat on the screen you're rolling the dice.  This one has gotten me through 2 minor drops (that I can remember)...but now the case is useless.  Good luck.",

The Star design is really cute and colorful.<br />2. The ring is a very handy phone stand and grip.<br />3. The pocket has a snap, meaning my cards, cash whatever are secured inside (a different ring/pocket case I had got soo loose that when one card was removed, everything would fall out - disastrous).<br />4. The pocket adheres very nicely to the phone - no peeling as of yet.<br />5. The material is very durable - so it feels like it will last.<br /><br />Considerations (not really Cons, but definitely FYI)<br />1. This adds some bulk to the phone in terms of weight and size.<br />2. The pockets don't really expand or shrink. The snap means items won't fall out, but you can not fit an infinite amount in here. I have 3 cards and 2 bills (money) folded inside and I have probably room for 2 more cards (I checked - but it's tight). 5 cards (no money) is the max comfort fit. I could wiggle a 6th in, but getting it back out was a struggle.",

I will probably only keep it for a month or two before I get sick of it. I just hate the sticky plastic feel and the smudgy fingeprints on the back. And good luck trying to get this on and off the phone. I feel like I'm going to break the corners of my phone every time I try to take it off. And the only reason I have to take it off is to clean the scuff marks and lint that gets back there. Yuck.",

The bubbles, scratches, imperfections will go away after 12 hours! It is crystal clear and makes the screen look great. However there are slight ridges on the screen when held up against the light (with the screen off), which I think is normal, but I wish it looked a little smoother.<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: When I took it out of the box, it had 2 particles stuck to it by the speaker cut-out.

But I recently started drinking protein smoothies or shakes in the morning, and I needed something that would keep the frozen texture for at least a couple of hours.  After only one day of using this product, I can already say I am very happy I made the switch.  I blended my frozen smoothie and poured it into this tumbler at 7 a.m.  When I finally got around to finishing the smoothie at 11 a.m., it was still frozen (I kept finding bits of ice!).  I rinsed it out and put water in at noon, and there was no lingering flavor issue.  The outside of the cup feels cool whenever I have a drink in it, but that does not bother me.  The only negative I've noticed so far is that I cannot use the straw for the smoothie, but the sip style lid works great for that use.  Overall, I would definitely buy this product again.<br /><br />Update (7/15/16): I tried using crushed ice in my water yesterday, but I noticed it melted within a couple of hours.  And I was inside an air conditioned building at the time.  Ice cubes have lasted a few hours longer, but they still melt pretty quickly.  The good news is even if the ice melts I've noticed my water will stay cold enough for me to keep using the cup.  If you are expecting ice to stay in solid form for a full 24 hours, this cup may not be the best option.  On average, I would say the ice does not stay in solid form for more than six hours or so.",

I think if I attached the antanea near a window that overlooks the outside and ran a very long cable (200+ feet), then this might have worked.<br /><br />Problem was actually solved by my provider T-Mobile. They sent me a wireless signal booster called Personal Cellspot for free and that worked perfectly. I first became aware of this when I called my provider to register the product. Two things that were of concern was that 1. this device is made in China. And after the governments warning about Huawei and anything internet related made in China, I was very concerned. 2. Also, FCC requires all devices such as these to be registered because it intercepts and boosts available signals.<br /><br />So I was happy that T-Mobile has it's own solution and the device they sent me is already pre-registered (and hopefully tested for protection).",

We'll take off the fee for it also. Just make sure you return it if you ever want to cancel with T-Mobile\". And then they sent it over next day via FedEx. I hooked it up and now I have signal.<br /><br />Bit about my situaiton. My new office is on the first floor of a bank. This used to be where they processed mortgage checks so the walls are very thick and reinforced. SO there is literally NO SIGNAL in the entire space. There are some spotty Edge signals. I was having a heck of a time trying to connect to anything. So once I got the units, I put the Window Unit (WU) next to a window facing outside. Got about three bars. Then I put the Coverage Unit (CU) right on my desk in the office. My office is about 100 ft away from the window. And I got SIGNAL! it was really painless. And I am now able to enjoy my internet freedom!<br /><br />The space between the window and my office is quite open.
