My wife's Motorola Droid Force 2 started acting up and I figured it was time to bite the bullet and get another phone.  I tried to get her another Motorola, but made the mistake of getting her a G6 Play model.  Not a wise choice.  She got frustrated with the performance issues quickly, so I looked on Amazon for an inexpensive alternative.  I found this phone.  The specs were what I was looking for.  Got the phone despite some bad reviews, and I couldn't be happier.  My wife LOVES the phone.  The pre-installed screen protector was a nice touch, and the cases, although flimsy, work well enough.  My wife really likes the  artsy one.  What I really liked was that the phone was EXTREMELY easy to set up.  After the initial set up, my Unreal Mobile SIM card was inserted, and APN settings were auto configured for me.  I rebooted the phone and it set up was complete.  Took me all of five minutes, if that,  to get the phone ready for use.  Lastly, the phone is very responsive.  There is no discernible lag when moving between screens or using multiple apps.  We don't play graphically intense games on the phone, but normal games run well. I am very impressed with this phone and will be looking to purchase either this same phone or another BLU phone in the future.",

I did have an issue with the trial SIM card not activating correctly on my wife's phone, but just tried again a few times avid the app eventually recognized The activated sim. The porting experience from Tmobile on both phones was painless and only took a matter of minutes.  Mint has been working great since.<br /><br />I'm a current TMobile customer.  I love TMobile, but don't like the monthly bill.  I decided to give Mint a try.  Slapped in the card, manually set up my SMS/VM and I've been good to go every since.  I've not signed up for actual service, so this is only a review of the trial 7 day experience.<br />Some Tips:<br />1. Make sure you have the manual SMS/VM set up process pulled up on Mint's website if you don't get the automatic set up to take.<br />2. If you travel around the country much, you're probably going to notice a difference in coverage.  Mint may not work for your needs.  I'd read the reviews to make sure Mint is right for you.<br />3. If you're not a heavy data user, don't leave a strong Tmobile covered area much and are interested in saving some $$$ per month, then try this out.  It's worth it.<br /><br />Mint will also credit your account with the $5.00 spent to test our their service.  Lastly, I thought the trial included 100 minutes, 100 MB of data, and 100 texts, but it came with 250 of each on the app.  That was a unexpected and welcome surprise.",

This case requires 2 hands to slide the back off (where the cards go) and even then I struggled. The plastic is hard and feels like it will snap if I pull too hard. The back comes completely off (Intentionally, I think) and that makes me worry that my cards could easily drop out. The card slot is also much wider than the cards - not sure if that matters but wanted to mention. I've had this case about 15 minutes, so I can't speak for longevity, but it doesn't feel as protective as others (based on the hard plastic vs a rubberized outer shell). The look is more masculine than I'd like, but nothing knocked off for that as I knew that before I ordered it. On a positive note, it fits the phone securely and all the buttons and holes line up perfectly. Overall, not a bad deal for $11, but it's just not user-friendly or sleek enough for me.",

I don't use the \"kickstand\" often as it feels kind of flimsy and I'd rather use it for the card holding function. I took off 1 star because the color is rubbing off on the corners. I have only had this for 4 months. When I leave the house (about 2-3 times per week), it's either in my purse or in the pocket of my leggings, so it's not really rubbing against anything rough like jeans. This case is slim enough to fit in a phone holder in my car that's pretty tight. I'd buy this again for the price.",

But if they're ever removed, the suction cup never works again.<br /><br />I had my car serviced last week, and for some reason, the mechanics took this off my dash. I put it back on, and it fell off the next day even though it was holding nothing. I'm glad my iPhone wasn't attached to it.<br /><br />I spent more money to get this one because I thought with all the adjustment buttons and the base plate it would work better than the cheaper one I had had. It didn't.<br /><br />I'm going to super glue it to the dash. It's either that or go into debt for a newer car with GPS, and since I drive less than 20 miles per month, that doesn't seem necessary. (Agoraphobia has it's advantages. :-D )<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW -- This is a very nice phone mount. It comes with clear instructions that are actually presented verbally and not just graphically, which is rare in our increasingly illiterate culture. I wish the arm that extends the phone were longer. I live in Las Vegas, and even though my dashboard is light beige, the sun and heat are so intense in the summer that my iPhone doesn't work at all if it's placed anywhere near the window. A longer arm that would place the phone a little more out of the sun would be really nice. But I do like this mount. It seems sturdy, so I don't worry that my phone will fall, which is important if you are relying on GPS. (The streets in Vegas are so screwed up and the street signs so well hidden that I don't dare try to drive anywhere without GPS.)",

I've been using these styluses for over a year, and they are high quality. However, when I purchased mine, they DID include an ink barrel, which according to the answer to a question above, they no longer do. That's nothing. A change that HAS decreased the value of this product is that replacement fiber tips were available because those do show wear over time and stop being effective. Those replacement tips are no longer available anywhere as far as I can determine. Now we get to either deal with mushy, ineffective tips or buy a completely new stylus. No, the styluses aren't that expensive. It is simply a matter of a corporation's attitude toward consumers that is objectionable. Perhaps instead of cutting services and decreasing the value of products, corporations could consider having fewer do-nothing executives or paying them less. (As a former corporate executive, I know what they spend their time doing, which is going to useless meetings so no one has to take responsibility for decisions or actions.) American consumers should not be the least important consideration for corporations, and we are. Yes, this is still a good stylus. But I'm much more likely to try another brand or go without because this corporation has demonstrated a lack of interest in consumer needs.",

Waste of money!<br /><br />I bought this set because I was tired of spending 1200 on a phone I never saw. It was easy to install both the front and back tempered glass so that was a big plus. Instructions made it pretty much idiot proof.  This is the first tempered glass set that adhered with no bubbles. I do love the price and the fact that it same with two.

I wound up purchasing a 3 pack from Verizon and that protector has done me better. The case itself is quite nice, very thin, and fits perfectly.

I discovered it was the bottom mic because everything worked fine when I used the speakerphone.  When you use the speakerphone, the phone uses the top mic.  But whenever I had the speakerphone disabled people could not hear me.<br /><br />Although you pretty much have to strip the entire phone to replace this part, it wasn't as difficult as I thought it was going to be.  My battery got stuck in the phone, and I could still complete the repair using ifixit's repair manual.<br /><br />The tools are the reason I purchased this specific one from Amazon - the tool kit is a MUST if you don't have the tools!  In the past I've had bad experiences with free tool kits (soft metal that strips too easily on the tools), but this kit is top!<br /><br />Remember not to lose the grounding cable or the rubber mount the covers the microphone - these are not included in the replacement kit - you need to use both of these from the original iPhone!<br /><br />Ben",

The snap on guide seems useless and to be a complete waste of time and resources. I question the “warranty” - I'm not comfortable simply emailing a gmail account to validate a lifetime warranty. I suspect doing so would open up Pandora's box of phishing schemes and bulk junk emails. Why not just validate the alleged warranty from Amazon purchases? And what exactly IS the warranty? Inside the packaging, there is nothing to explain what is and isn't covered and how the program works. Is there a shipping fee? Does the “warranty” only provide a future purchase at a discount rate?<br /><br />My verdict: Bubbles, Bubbles, BUBBLES!<br /><br />I followed the instructions to the letter and my result was horrible.<br /><br />I “wasted” my first screen using the snap on screen tool. By using this “tool,” the protector adhered incorrectly over the front facing camera and sensor.<br /><br />I removed that screen, tossed it along with the snap on guide and was then able to correctly line up the protector.<br /><br />Screen #2 better aligned but bubbles galore. Both edges are a hot mess.<br /><br />The protector distorts my screen color. Extremely distracting.<br /><br />My facial recognition sensor now no longer functions instantly. It's delayed and rendered inefficient.<br /><br />Screen touch is SLOOOW. I'm having to long press each key multiple times just to type.<br /><br />Without yet placing my case over my phone, I tested voice recording. The sound is muffled.<br /><br />The protector does not feel sturdy enough to even protect.<br /><br />I'm going to cut my losses, use this while waiting 2 more days for Prime to deliver a protector from another vendor. Once that protector arrives, I'll remove this brand and toss it.<br /><br />Your review and results may differ. I'm personally not going to allow a $13 product to intrude upon how I expect my $1200 phone to function.",

This one, however, does cover most of the screen, and with my very slim case on, it is highly unlikely that something could hit the screen in the 2 mm space between my case and the glass with enough force to break the actual screen.  So with a case, this is virtually 100% coverage, compared to other protectors.  The touch functionality was not diminished at all for me, and felt exactly like the actual screen.  I barely notice it's on.<br /><br />I will also give this two stars because both times I dropped my phone, it protected my actual screen from any damage.  So does protect the screen.<br /><br />I am not giving it the last two stars because on both occasions where I dropped my phone (just out of my hand onto the pavement), the glass of the protector cracked and now it looks horrible.  At least with a film protector, it would ding it in the spot where it took the hit, but this glass ends up with large cracks, and has to be replaced more often.  Also, you can get most of the bubbles out if you try hard enough.  I wound up with a small strip of bubbles right near the edge of one corner, but I could not see it when the screen was on, so it did not bother me, but if that is something you just could not live with, you may want to look else where.",

I have a tempered screen glass protector on my phone, and the &#34;lip&#34; is not raised enough to prevent the glass from surfaces when using face down.  I dropped my phone twice and both times the tempered glass cracked.  I am disappointed because the case is very aesthetically appealing to the eye, with it's sleek design and fun color palette, but not after using it for more than one day.  Also, I recently purchased a Belkin charging dock, and it would not charge on the dock with the case on, which should have been no problem, with the removable bottom piece.  Except for when I took that off, there is the soft inner liner that also prevented the connection, so I had to take that off too.  Too much trouble to do every time I want to dock it.  I hope to see a future product with a liner built into each piece of the case, for easy docking, as well as a tougher outer casing so every bump doesn't damage the case and take the paint off.",

    "text": "I REALLY wanted this to work. I find the charging port on my Galaxy S5 to be really cumbersome, and I hate going to bed with that slight frustration and irritation that comes from fumbling with the charging cable. So this wireless charger seemed like a GREAT idea - I could just set the phone down on this thing and go to sleep!<br /><br />At first it seemed like it worked. I had properly installed the charger piece in the phone and when I set the phone on the charger, the green light lit up at the bottom and the phone announced that it was now charging - MAGIC!<br /><br />That same night, I kept waking up because my phone's screen kept waking up (lighting up the room) throughout the night for some reason. That's when I discovered that this charger will charge for a few minutes, and then stop suddenly (solid green light turns to a red blinking light for a few seconds and then solid red). Then, a few minutes later, the red light will go off, and the phone will start charging again... for a few minutes, and the whole cycle just repeats over and over and over again.<br /><br />Ultimately, the phone never really gets charged if I have any apps that run in the background (e.g. CNN) and Bluetooth/Wifi turned on because everything together sucks more juice than the little spurts of power that come from the few minutes of charging. So the result is a dead, warm phone in the morning (unless I disable everything, which sort of defeats the convenience aspect of this product).<br /><br />Just to be sure it wasn't a bad power issue, I tried this charger on another outlet / circuit and got the same result. Then I plugged it into my UPS unit (which regulates voltage) and still got the same result. I also tried removing the phone from its Otterbox case (just in case the intermittent issue was something related to the case), and again, same result.<br /><br />I came here to leave a review and discovered that several other people were having the same issue, and that TYLT had responded, asking them to email customer service to see about a replacement. So before I wrote this review, I emailed TYLT and explained the issue. That was 4 business days ago, and I haven't even gotten an auto-reply to confirm they received my email. So not only does my TYLT charger not work, their customer service apparently doesn't respond to emails.<br /><br />I guess I will be returning this and staying away from TYLT products in the future. Maybe there's another charger that will work better...",

    "text": "Wondering why some reviewers say that it doesn't fit the extended battery and others say it works beautifully? Keep reading - I'll explain.<br /><br />Based on another review, it sounded like this case would work with the Hyperion extended battery, so I bought both and got them today.<br /><br />The Hyperion extended battery comes with the battery itself and the \"extended\" back for the phone which curves around to allow space for the larger battery. It looked great by itself, so I then started to put on the Seidio case.<br /><br />The Seidio case comes with a rubber-like skin that wraps around the phone, and then a harder \"skeleton\" case that goes around the rubber.<br /><br />For about 5 solid minutes, I tried to fit the phone into that case without any luck. The curved Hyperion battery back introduces a curve over the camera lens and flash area, but the hard Seidio case is designed to \"push\" into that area, so it pushes against the battery back and it just won't fit.<br /><br />The only way to make it fit is to actually LEAVE OFF the battery backing for the Hyperion battery. Once you do that, it fits decently well, and it covers the entire backside of the phone, so the battery case isn't needed. I honestly do not like this one bit. I would much prefer to have both the Hyperion battery cover AND the Seidio case on at the same time. I hate having \"leftover\" parts for things that I just bought. I knocked off two stars off my rating just for this design - I would have never bought this case if I had known this.<br /><br />So if you read other conflicting reviews, you'll be able to tell who tried to fit the Seidio case around everything versus the people who left off the battery backing.<br /><br />I'm okay with the feel of the case. The buttons are accessible, no ports are blocked or anything, and I don't feel as concerned about the phone falling out of my pocket.<br /><br />I don't like the kickstand because it BARELY works. It will fold under the slightest pressure. So if a cable is connected, you're only going to be able to use the kickstand in one orientation. If they had simply designed it to be slightly thicker and with a slight curve at the end (a la HTC Thunderbolt), it would have made it a hundred times more versatile.<br /><br />Don't buy this for the kickstand, and don't buy this if you want to keep your battery case cover on. Otherwise, go for it.",

Now it has completely stopped working.<br /><br />We were using our old chargers from our last phone since Samsung followed Apple to \"help the environment\" by not providing chargers in their new phone boxes. I save the environment in other ways but doing this doesn't help because we still have to buy them anyways.. especially going from LG to Samsung.<br /><br />Besides that vent, these work extremely well! What our old chargers were taking 3-10hrs to charge, (3-5w); this 45w charger now makes our phones 100% in 1hrs time!!! It does heat up the phone like our very first Samsung did in their start of the line, but I think it's the higher power of the cable. Definitely doesn't get at hot has their ones from the beginning of the Galaxys phones.<br /><br />We are very pleased this was a 2pk and their performance!

Doesn't add too much heft or excess thickness to the phone. The screen protector, though extremely easy to apply with no bubbles so long as you use the dust remover tape and the cloth, is a little tacky at first, though after a few weeks that sticky plasticy feel should go away. all-in-all great product, would recommend, maybe buy a different screen protector if you don't like the one that comes with this.",

It's been sleepless nights left and right for the whole family. The headphones worked okay, thankfully I'm a deep sleeper. I've got a fear of ear plugs but thanks to the wire connecting them, I know I'll always be able to get them out of my ears! One day when the headphones just weren't doing it, I combined them and it's been blissful sleep every since. They're drilling through brick and concrete often right next door or one floor above me so some sound still comes through but it's definitely quiet enough for anyone to sleep through. The headphones can be a bit uncomfortable if you don't sleep on your back but it's only a small issue. My family insisted I shouldn't waste money because the construction would be over soon but their deadlines kept getting pushed further back and for the very affordable price of $15 I am the only one sleeping at night probably in my entire building. This is one of the best purchases of my life and honestly I laugh everytime I think about the people who told me not to buy it and now they're the ones who never get any rest!<br /><br />Oh and I can still hear my phone alarm in the morning! Might take an extra 5 minutes through so set 1 slightly earlier alarm if you're someone who has trouble hearing the alarm through sleep.",

I have installed quite a few screen protectors in my time iPhone and android but this one here left me scratching my head no installation tray no tabs to grab onto for such a premium price you would expect premium installation tools. But unfortunately that's not the case with this product I would suggest other premium brands that are more precise !!!  UPDATE I spoke to rhino shield customer service and they were very helpful in replacing the screen protector I also let them know that their installation instructions needed to be more detailed and they took my suggestions and I believe in the future they will make the necessary adjustments other premium screen protectors have a installation tray that rhino shield does not have if this installations tray Was provided I would give it five stars but as the product sits now the original review is still valid but rhino shield is listening so I'm willing to give them another try good quality service customer service makes all the difference in the world a company that stands behind their product",

UPDATE 12/14/20 This is still a good case but I notice in cold weather the case gets even slippery then usual because of the cold temperatures if you're outside for any period of time especially with temperatures below freezing the combination of the slick back and temperature drop makes the case feel like a bar of slippery Soap good thing it has two layers of protection so if you do drop your phone in this case it will be well protected !!!",

I will def be purchasing another for some up coming travel it's gonna be weird on a plane not having to worry about battery life.

Witch means I don't have to buy a car charger as well..don't have to worry about being close to my charger either..just set my phone right on this charger and bam! Charging! Also, I can charge my husband's phone and mine at the same time and it charges pretty fast! It also very sleek and lightweight! Great charger!",
