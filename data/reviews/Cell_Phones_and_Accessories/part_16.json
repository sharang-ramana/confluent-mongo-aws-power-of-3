The Voice Assist works fairly well - alot of times it will start playing music when I ask it to make a call and if I just try using voice commands without the voice assist it rarely works. I also am noticing that the battery life is way way less than what is stated, it says it has a 14 hour talk time but when I get to around the 7 - 8 hour mark it says low battery and shuts down maybe 10 minutes later. over-all i'm happy with it as I don't use voice commands very often and just the battery issue is my main downside.",

The turning ring holder is ferfect for nearly hands free operation ! I'm constantly on the phone and I have M.S. so my hands and grip get tired and weak so the extremely well designed turning ring holder is a life saver !!! I like the colors offered - went off the beaten path and got the lavender one because purple is my favorite color and I love it !!! Five stars straight across the board for this item *****!!!",

Unfortunately, I have to inform you that the serial numbers you have provided belong to a counterfeit or fake case.<br /><br />We have received quite a few inquiries from customers with these exact serial numbers and after inspection of these cases, they have been deemed to be counterfeit. Also, Internet sites such as Amazon ( If not purchase from LifeProof Amazon store) and eBay, are not authorized sellers and we do not have control over the products that are offered on these websites. Due to this ill-fated situation, we are unable to offer any warranty assistance. Without a genuine LifeProof case, there is not a genuine LifeProof warranty.<br /><br />If you would like to purchase a case directly from LifeProof, please visit our website at [...].

I have a large, heavy, TCL phone, so I was fully prepared for the phone to be too heavy for the holder, but the heavy-duty, adjustable neck is able to hold it just fine, even while I'm driving. I actually have to put some strength into adjusting the neck - that's how heavy-duty it is. You can also adjust the base so that it fills up your cup holder, providing a nice solid foundation. I was bummed when I got a new car recently and learned that my model didn't have the GPS appear on the car's screen, so I was concerned that if I needed to use GPS I would still need to do so unsafely. But (and this may be my only gripe with this product) this holder essentially keeps your phone up to your nose so you can see it easily without taking your eyes off the road for too long. Suggestion: it's probably better to use this in your back cupholder because if it's in the front one, you may bang into it when going into gear. This won't dislodge it or anything, but it could distract you while you're driving, which could be dangerous.",

    "text": "I originally had an LG Tribute with 4 GB of memory, and I unfortunately needed to replace it after less than two years because of normal updates taking up most of my memory. This phone makes a viable substitute, as it has more memory, so I can use apps again (I deleted everything off of my old phone and still did not have room). Plus, and most importantly, it has all of the same programs that I use regularly (Chrome, Maps, Bluetooth capability, etc.). I was able to keep my phone number, since I am just transferring phones and not providers (&#34;still [using Virgin Mobile] after all these years&#34;), and it was super easy to add this phone to my account. It prompts you right in the phone to substitute this phone with your old phone, so you basically do everything through a pre-programmed app - easy peasy. Normally, I am not a fan of the bigger displays, because I am big on carrying my phones in my pocket, but I actually thoroughly enjoy the bigger display on this phone because I can read more text messages at once, and videos are significantly larger. Plus, I find I am &#34;enlarging&#34; things a lot less because the font is bigger. Websites that are built to be mobile-friendly are more easy to view on the crystal-clear display.<br /><br />The only issue I have so far with this phone is that it could not be made out of flimsier material. I dropped it outside my car today after not even owning it for 24 hours, and it already has no less than four scratches along the border. Also, there is a tiny piece of plastic running along the top of the phone and covering the power button on the back - be sure to remove those (I didn't realize they were there until this morning). And yes, the power button/volume buttons are those flat buttons on the back. I consulted the user's manual, and I *still* couldn't figure out where they were. Just found them by trial and error.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing: the stylus is great - it seems like it's made out of a kind of material that makes it look like a tiny microphone. Though, once you pop it out, there's a little pen symbol that appears in the top right of the phone, should you want to use any of the stylus-related apps. If you visit a web page with a &#34;search&#34; magnifying glass in this same corner, you will have to put the stylus back and use your finger in order to search, since the pen symbol appears right over the magnifying glass.<br /><br />All in, I am thoroughly enjoying this phone and am happy with my purchase. Just be sure to purchase a case to go with it, since it WILL get scratched immediately after dropping it. You don't get any second chances with these materials.",

    "text": "The perfect phone for me.  This is my first smartphone, and I don't really need it to do much.  All I need is the capability of checking my e-mail via a quick and reliable connection while on the road, and this delivers.  I was also able to upgrade my phone easily through the Virgin Mobile site, so there was no worry about needing to change my phone number (I got to keep my old one).  Swiping makes sending text messages much easier and faster, and multiple messages are combined to read as one long message - infinitely more effective than having to wait for each message to send separately like with my old phone.  Plus, I can now use the Bluetooth feature in my car, which is an infinitely safer way to take a call.  I only pay $38 a month for my pay-as-you-go contract with Virgin Mobile, and I love it.  I refuse to pay upwards of $65 a month for the same service elsewhere.  With an SD card (because it doesn't come with a lot of memory), you can store music and photos on this phone, just like any other, and you can download apps like Amazon Music (to stream your music library or listen to Prime music for free), or apps that connect you to your personal bank and e-mail.  I had originally installed the Facebook app but uninstalled it after receiving constant notifications on my phone every time there was an update.  Just as effective is to keep Facebook open in a Chrome window on the phone and access it whenever you need to - it updates in real time so it's essentially the same thing as the app, without the annoying pop-ups.  I like my phone to alert me when something important is happening, not just because a friend of a friend commented on a friend's status.  The only thing I don't like is that if you miss a call or a text message, the only way to know is to remember to check your phone - this is particularly a pain if you use your phone for business.  I have only ever owned one phone in my lifetime that featured a blinking light until you tended to the missed notification.  I have been trying to find an app that will allow me to do this, but the only ones I have found thus far are those that control the LED light of the (fantastic) camera on the phone, but that light (flash) is crazy bright and not really helpful if the phone is laying down or in your pocket, the only two places where a phone would normally be.  And if you're holding the phone already, the LED light going off won't be very helpful, since you're probably already aware of an incoming call/text message.  Photos come out perfect when you have good lighting, though this phone's camera isn't the best at compensating for dull lighting.  You can flip it to be front-facing or rear-facing, so you can use it for selfies or like a regular camera.  The video quality is impeccable, though, as it holds a pretty good steady cam despite my shaky hands.  All in, this phone was perfect for the &#34;I pretty much stole it&#34; price, and you just can't compete with the $38 a month that Virgin Mobile charges.  Even their most expensive plan is still cheaper than the run-of-the-mill plan that other phones come with, and I don't need all that their most expensive plan has to offer.  This plan with this phone perfectly meets my needs.",

It fits well and buttons are spot on. However as per my above photo from earlier tonight, this is what the edge looked like after only having recd it 3 days ago. I have not used any liquids on the screen since installing. Have no idea what might cause this, however I think it makes the phone look kind of gimmicky, not my cup of tea, so I'm returning it. I  have read that case yellowing seems pretty common w clear cases. I guess those reviews were correct. On the other hand, if you like the two-tone effect, well then this is the case for you.",

I previously have bought the very small cube Anker and Aukey fast chargers, however their performance has been disappointing so I wanted to get it right this time and I got lucky. This piece looks like a knock off of the Samsung fast charger, which I can tell you is not that fast, in my experience. Larger form factor than most these days, it definitely does the job.<br /><br />I found an old LG5 phn this weekend at the bottom of a drawer that had been dead for years. I plugged it in and was up to 20% in less than 15 minutes, then 47% at 30 min, and 100% at just under 60min with phn off. Have never seen a phn charge this fast, especially as this one is around 6 years old, I think. It comes with a cable, which isn't the sturdiest I've seen and a small grey pouch. I chose to use my own UBS-C cable instead.<br /><br />No big dislikes. Was very glad I wound up ordering this one. If you want fast, check this one out.  (Thank me later).",

I was on the cusp of just returning it and ordering a tpu glass like protector instead, it was then I noticed their install video blurb on the box. I watched it, figured I'd give it another go before returning. Much to my surprise things went great the second time around. Their protector is completely invisible and my thumblock press now works just about every time. No bubbles, no creases, feels great, much better than plastic/glass tpu type ones I have used up until now. It's great if you can pay attention. I really like it.",

In their infinite wisdom Tracfone dropped me from our family value plan, only been on it for years--same phone number same customer ID same as before except they do not know who the devil I am with my new phone?? If I want to be re-enrolled in our family plan I need to call back at the end of October, but before the new minutes are charged for November and then they \"should be able to re-enroll my phone in the value plan\"\" SHOULD!!!!  After another hour on the phone with them I am just amazed that this is my fault! I was actually told that I should have informed the customer service rep that I will need to reenroll my phone in the same plan it was already enrolled in, when they swapped over to the new phone. I informed her that at no time was I made aware that upgrading a Tracfone was also a cancelation of current phone plan. Of cource I could re-enroll right now however since my wifes phone had already gotten her minutes I would have to pay the full months value plan charges as well as what was already charged to my account for just my wifes phone --oh and she will not get any more minutes since she already recieved hers this month.... Just amazing!!",

    "text": "It is thin and lightweight yet has a very big screen, however, the screen is just the perfect size. It doesn't feel like a \"phablet.\" It feels and is just a functional phone. I do suggest the 32GB version because the external memory chips are only good for movies and music and maybe personal videos. I have noticed some lag even with the 64 GB, but it was resolved by removing some apps and deleting others. The only thing I a dubious about is the actual frequencies this phone supports. Does it work perfectly with Verizon or ATT? I'm not an engineering guy so I can't answer that question. I did have a very cheap phone from the same carrier that seemed to have superior voice quality. It could be a fluke, like a degraded tower or ill weather. I can say that Cricket picks up the best in my neighborhood. I would love to hear of other people's experience with quality. If I get rid of the phone, it will be because I want a replacement. I love this phone.",

The suction on this charger stand is really strong and has a clamp clip as well to lock it on place.<br />One of the interesting features I found is that the charger as an automated powered clamp. When you put the phone into the charging pad the clips automatically close to the desired size of your phone. No more fiddling and closing clamps. You may love it, or even hate this feature at it's a drop harder to take it out of the cradle. There is a side button you press and it opens the clamps automatically to remove your phone, but when the clamps open your phone will fall out.<br />It has fast charging but you must make sure you have the latest high speed cable and adapters to get the fastest charge. Overall, an excellent charger compared to the many I have purchased in the past by other brands.<br />I hope this review and pics were of help to you.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:682bf1d6c04ddf4fd40c35d6a1e5249a]] The SPORTLINK case is well made and perfect for my iPhone 12 Pro Max. It feels comfortable in my hands, easy to install, and looks like it belongs! Does not hinder any use on the buttons or charger.<br />Case seems to be very durable and I know my phone will be protected when I go to the beach or spend time outdoors. My last case was not waterproof and I spilled iced coffee on it by accident and I swore I will invest in a better case this time around.<br />In my honest and humble opinion, I highly recommend going with this case over any other fancy brand cases on the market. The technology is out there for everyone to make them water and dust proof, so I don't overpay for those expensive brands.<br />Also comes with a wrist lanyard which comes in handy when going on rides or places where my phone can slip out of my hands.<br /><br />Tip: Do a water test according to the instructions to make sure you sealed it well. I put a piece of paper inside to make sure it did not get wet.<br /><br />I hope my pics and review were helpful to you.",

No matter what cable I have, I can charge it. It is a little bulky and heavy weighing in at 1lb and 7 ounces for what I wanted, but well worth the power I get out of it.<br />Powers up my laptop, phones, tablets, and even my ring light.

I have purchased this NANAMI brand in the past and was always satisfied. So I now purchased this one as well for my new Samsung S21 and S21 plus. This time I bought the silver color to match my phone. Came with usb cable and charging brick as well. Just rest the phone on the charger and your done. I like to cool thin blue light that glows when charging which also turns green once fully charged. There's also some rubberized like grip to the bottom plate where your phone rests and it helps keep your phone in place without sliding. Overall, a good charger to own.",

Comes with cloth, alcohol wipes, stickers to help remove dust, and a few clear sheets you can use if something goes wrong or save for a later time. Also has a mold you put over the phone so your protection glass sheet fits perfectly over your existing phone.<br />What's amazing is that when you drop the protector into the frame guide, it automatically start to push out the air bubbles, looks like a blob moving. I would say 95% bubble free. The other 5% you should push out the remaining bubble with the supplies squeegee. Overall, this is an excellent easy to apply protector and will definitely buy it again when needed.",

    "text": "I am on the go a lot and find myself running out of power on my phone or laptop. When visiting my aunt in the hospital, or going on the road for the day, I always lose my power towards the end of the day. Most phones last these days for about 12 hours if you are lucky. But without a charge a few times a day to keep going, they will eventually die. So I purchased this beauty. I didn't really need a solar charger, so it was a great advantage to one built in. Compact & portable and weighing only 13 ounces, makes it easy to carry with me wherever I go. ( Also great for camping, hiking, etc. ) Very satisfied with my purchase. Will also buy one for a gift as well.",

The power supply is a true QC 3.0 so you are getting fast charging speeds. You have to use their power supply to the main base to get the fast speed, but it will not transfer that speed to the secondary charging base. But it does charge nicely.

I like the push button quick release to open the latch which makes it faster to remove from your wrist. The only problem I had was the installation. Took me 20 minutes to get adjusted to my normal wrist size. Unlike the original Samsung band, there is no quick release switch to remove the band straps from the watch face. So you have to do it the old fashion way, using your nail or the mini tool they supply you with to get the band link pin into place. Very frustrating. Also, once you get the two straps on, now you have to cut the band to fit your wrist. More pin releases and cutting several times to get it right. The band is good quality for the price, but installation is time consuming. Instructions are clear if you have patience to follow them.",

It feels a bit light and flimsy when I first opened it, but it really does the job as advertised and hold up to normal use.<br /><br />First off, the suction to my dashboard, or windshield is really powerful. It has a tight clamp that makes the suction stronger and easier to adhere to the dash or windshield. I had many other mounts in the past that just falls off the windshield when getting too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter. Also, It comes with a metal plate to stick to your dashboard first if you car has a bumpy type dash.<br /><br />Pro:  I mostly purchased this item as it has wireless charging so I don't need to plug in a usb cable into my phone every time I get into my car. ( also saves wear & tear on you phones charging port )<br /><br />Con:  Newer cars have Android or Apple Play. This means your phone cable has to be connected directly to the USB port of your car.

No fake PU Leather here. This is a nice stitched case and is of much higher quality than the multitudes of cases out there. I have multiple different iPhone cases of varying levels of protection. I dislike the feeling of a bulky case. This wallet case seems to have the perfect mix of slim profile and screen protection. It does have a decent raised lip that will provide some protection if dropped face down. It isn't going to offer the protection of an otter box defender- but neither will any other slim case out there. I have multiple choices at varying price points and this is the one that I choose to use most of the time. Ports are all accessible (even for larger lightning cables) and buttons work well. This is a pretty durable case! This particular one has a nice leather cover and then a harder part that clips on to give it like an exoskeleton. The combination of the two give it a hefty feel, without adding actual bulk or too much weight. I like that the outer part is grippy and doesn't let the phone slide around when set on a smooth surface. The button covers are responsive and I don't have to press too hard or overcompensate for not being able to feel the actual buttons, themselves. Good case - especially for the price. The case I purchased is pretty attractive and substantial. I like that it can hold my ID and a credit card so I can just have one thing to hold onto if I want to travel quick and light.<br />iCaseit usually makes pretty good products as I have owned another case made by them, and I love it too.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review.

    "text": "This is my first time owning a Casguru Wallet Case Vault Shockproof [Credit Card] Cover Security Slot Storage iphone case. Its a pretty decent case that covers the basics of phone protection, but though it looks nice, it's not the most protective case either. The back is a bit bulky and the front bumper just barely comes past the screen. It feels a little awkward because it is not equally distributed between front and back because of the card holder. However, this could certainly be handy going out for the night and keeping my ID and credit card hidden inside the phone case. The only this id be concerned with is putting a hotel key card in it as they hotel cards are wiped pretty easily if put near a cell phone.<br />Some of my thoughts on this phone case:<br />- The case comes in a simple easy to open package<br />- It's two pieces, supposedly double the protection, but the two parts separately don't cover the complete phone, so if the thin outer frame cracks, you might as well toss it.<br />- I found it fairly easy to separate the two pieces, but they do fit snugly together.<br />- The material is thermoplastic polyurethane, but if feels like it's softer then plastic and should offer protection against drops<br />- The back is textured in a unique way, which makes it nice and sharp looking<br />- Headphone jack, speakers, charging socket, screen button and volume buttons are easily accessible with the exception of the ringer/volume on/off button. The cutout is deep and it can be hard to get to. Much more difficult to access, than any other case I've tried. A minor issue for me  but for some it may be a problem worth mentioning.<br />- Buttons are really responsive<br />- It's lightweight<br />-Holds credit cards securely<br /><br />The look and feel is very nice. Unlike several cases I have tried the edges of the case are not slick at all. The navy color and wavelength pattern really look great in person and the champagne gold matches the champagne gold iPhone very closely.<br />To sum it up this case is not perfect but it's certainly nice looking and texturally different than most plastic/rubber phone cases. It does have a minor flaw with the ringer/silencer, but the design and look are spiffy.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review.

    "title": "Long stylus leads to hours of fun and pleasure!",
    "text": "I am a fan of these new Fenix gold extra long stylus pens. For the pluses, these 7&#34; long styluses deserve 5 stars:<br />1. I really like the extra length. Especially if you have a hint of carpel tunnel or arthritis, I think you will agree. The extra long stylus is just easier to handle for long periods of time.<br />2. Very light weight, yet do not bend<br />3. The 15&#34; lanyard inserts easily and it never wobbled out by itself. If you are putting it in and taking out many times a day, I imagine there would come a day where it would &#34;strip&#34; and no longer stay in, But over a month, it did not reach that point.<br />4. Absolutely scratchless on both my tablet and on my phone.<br />5. Aesthetics - the gold certainly is classy looking.<br />Considerations that were neither here nor there for me:<br />1. The lanyards arrive unattached. It is is easy to attach one to the end of the stylus. Also easy to detach from the stylus if you want to leave it.<br />2. Having the stylus attached to your tablet or phone (I tried it with both) is one of those things which works wonderfully some times and gets in the way other times. This is not the fault of the stylus, that's just the way it is.<br />Cons to the Fenix Extra Long Stylus<br />1. The 7&#34; length means that this is not a stylus you'll put in your pocket.<br />2. The stylus end is a soft fabric covered cushion, shaped like a pencil eraser. After one month of constant use with the same stylus on my tablet (can you say &#34;games&#34;), the fabric stylus end squished flatter than it did originally when it was pressed down on a screen. It popped up back into shape when it wasn't being pressed down, it didn't stop working and it didn't start scratching. But the squishiness made it harder to be exact. For most of the games I play, the flattened surface is not a problem and I continue to use the old stylus. But checking links on websites, or changing pages on an amazon list just need more care (or expanding the view) when using a stylus where the end squashes flatter. As these are inexpensive styluses, this may or may not be a problem. So far it hasn't been a game changer for me.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review.

Overall took about a 1.5 hours to take apart and put back together, and phone seems to getting better signal.<br />Don't be misled about other parts to fix the wifi. The wifi chip is soldered into the logic board. It is not removeable. The other item people seem to but is a cover for the wifi chip, and then they wonder why it still doesn't work. Make sure you get the right parts if you are going to take on this endeavor. You will encounter impossibly small screws, and you will need a eyeglass repair flathead screw driver which does NOT come with this set, which is why I dinged it one star. There is only one screw (the standoff screw) which requires a tiny flathead, and without it, you aren't getting the logic board out to replace this antenna.",

    "text": "This Bentoben iPhone 6 case is just another rubbery interior with a bendy plastic decorative cover. It's not particularly nice looking in person. While the pictures in the Amazon ad are accurate, the 'rose gold' cover simply has no life to it. It has sort of a satin finish. Not shiny, not flat either. I'm sure it provides some decent scratch protection for the phone, but to me it's just another ordinary case in a sea of cases. There is nothing about it that differentiates itself from the pack.<br />The cutouts are correct, but I certainly don't see how they can claim 'perfect protection'. Since there is a big hole in the middle to show the apple logo, it certainly can't protect from dust or scratches in that area especially. I also have no idea what they mean by luggage pattern design on the inside. It offers absolutely no shock absorption since these lines are merely cosmetic and not deep enough to provide an air cushion.<br />As for the claim, that it was designed in Italy, that is just silly marketing and highly doubtful as an Italian designed product probably wouldn't be packaged in a thin plastic bag with no labelling except for a giant hazard warning not to suffocate a baby with the bag. Not impressed with this case. Sorry Bentoben. Try again.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review.

The best thing that you can say about these screen protectors is that they work well and this one does. Time will tell exactly how reliable it is, but I am pleased with the ease of application and that my phone is very responsive to touch still.l<br />They came similarly packaged in a hard plastic (which I find better than the cardboard packaging because we all know what the USPS can do to packages in in transit) and with virtually the same contents. All the screen protectors were nicely protected in a padded sleeve.<br />You really do not need to be that smart to figure out how to put the screen protector on, but in case you do they all cam with instructions.<br />At this point I think I consider myself an expert in screen protectors, I've purchased about 2 dozen of them throughout my cellphone history..<br />Applying it was very simple, I didn't need to use any of the guide stickers. It didn't leave any air bubbles on my screen.<br />It pretty much applied itself once I aligned it and pressed lightly on the middle of the screen.<br />Just like most screen protectors for iPhone, it does not cover the phone edge to edge, because the edges are curved.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Super Thin<br />- Well Packaged, will not arrive damaged<br />- Easy instructions and easy to apply.<br />- Privacy protection!<br />- The touch seems to be 9.5/10 the same as it was before<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Nothing I can think of<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a unbiased and fair review.

The surface feels great to the touch and looks great. Installation is fairly straightforward. Just be sure the surface is clean. You don't want to risk lifting the screen and having it crack.

I gave this product a five star rating due to the fact that this case fits my iPhone my well and protects the device in all the right places. This case is a smart case so when I close the case my iPhone goes to sleep and wakes up when I open the case. I love the genuine leather feel and smell ! This is a great case for everyday use. I do like the classic look of the black leather case which makes a subtle, classy statement. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a thin iPhone case that keeps their device protected. Like the Apple smartcover, it folds into a triangle stand for horizontal viewing. The stand is strong and sturdy, withstanding heavy tapping/typing and/or desk shaking. Couldn't be happier with that. Perfect case anyone who wants to protect their phone. Works wonders at keeping the device free of scratches, dents, dings, and anything else that keeps it from performing. Specifically designed for this phone, the stylish case fits perfectly, keeping your iphone 6 safe and protected from drops, dings, scratches. The genuine leather is a nice touch, that keeps the device looking like it was just out of the box. The case has a Great look and a great investment in protection. Precision cut material allows full function of all buttons, camera, and microphone and speakers.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a unbiased and fair review.

    "title": "Nice case, different texture",
    "text": "This is a VERY durable case! I needed a more rugged, protective case for when I was out doing things where I'd be more likely to drop my phone and need protection (hiking, etc). This particular one has a soft, cushion-y &quot;skin&quot; and then a harder part that clips on to give it like an exoskeleton. The combination of the two give it a hefty feel, without adding actual bulk or too much weight. I REALLY love that the softer part is grippy and doesn't let the phone slide around when set on a smooth surface. The button covers are responsive and I don't have to press too hard or overcompensate for not being able to feel the actual buttons, themselves. The cherry on top for this case is the fact that it comes with a color-matched stylus (which works well and has a clip on top so you can attach it to stuff like a pen), a microfiber cleaning cloth (again, works really well, very soft) and a screen protector for the touchscreen. I haven't used that bit because I already have one on my phone that's been working well, but if it ever needs replacing, Good case - especially for the price. The case  I purchased is pretty attractive and substantial. At first I didn't think I could turn phone on and off - but realigned the case and the button is accessible. However I don't think I could mute easily with this case on so took off a star. Fix that flaw and it will be a great product. All in all, a great case if you want something sturdier than just a plastic wraparound one. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",

Pictures without the flash seem to be perfectly fine. Since I plan on using it on a snorkeling trip, I am a little disappointed that I won't be able to use the flash.<br />Update: product was kind of a bust when it came to taking underwater photos. The water made it extremely difficult to swipe, zoom, select photo type, etc.  Basically I had to set my phone to never turn off and open the camera app before we went into the water with it. Even still, the swiping was very inaccurate and would often select the wrong selection than what I intended. The pictures came out pretty decent once I got it set up, but I admit it was quite frustrating that you couldn't use the phone in the pouch while fingers were wet. It was only good for just pressing the shutter button. Zooming in and out under water was just too much of a hassle and I gave up trying. On the plus side, it is well made, thick plastic, and kept the phone completely dry.",

I love the depth of these as I can now hopefully not be picking up around the dog mat all the time.<br />The bowls are dishwasher safe and stackable to take with you whereever you go. The bowls are solidly made and should last a good amount of time.<br />Included with the bowls is a dog leash which I would use only on a very small dog. It is a smaller link chain with a handle measuring at full length approximately 46 inches total.<br />I received these products at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.",

    "text": "Pink being my favorite color naturally this caught my attention.  It is the first time I have ever seen one with a nice cord to hang your phone around your neck. The locking mechanism is very tight and  secure.  I will find this to be most helpful when I am walking the dogs, at the casino, or where ever I go.  I don't always carry a pocketbook with me so I find I carry my phone and hope I don't put it down and forget to pick it up.<br />The case is made with a faux leather and is very soft and smooth.  There is a buckle at the very top of the case to snap your phone in securely.  All of the appropriate openings and details line up perfectly.  A very cool feature of this case is that it does have a attached car holder on the back for you to carry a credit card, money or your license.  So easy if you are running to or into a store quickly. You can also use this to prop your phone up.<br />My only concern was that the top and bottom straps on the front are thin and wonder if they will wear or stretch quickly.<br />I did receive this product free in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.",

    "text": "I purchased this power cube for myself as I am always leaving the house without my phone charged fully.  Yes I have a car charger but, when I go out with my husband in his truck he has a different phone for business and his charger naturally doesn't work for my phone.  My children all have different phones so to solve the problem I chose to order this.  I was so surprised when this nice looking slim trendy device was delivered to my door.  This power cube has the charger attached to the bottom and it folds nicely right around the bottom.  It does come with a beautiful grey velour carrying case with a drawstring.  I will carry this in my pocketbook for those times that I do need a charge and I'm in someone else's car.<br />This cube also comes with a cable for charging the unit or additional electronic devices at the same time.<br />It was boxed beautifully for gift giving and comes with complete and easy instructions.<br />The charging time is about 45 minutes for your phone, 4 hours approx. for the cube and it does have LED indicators on the front side for the power supply.<br />I now can be worry free as I will always have this with me to charge my phone when its power gets low. I would recommend this to everyone as a back up power supply.  I will be sure it is charged for our first snow storm in case we lose power also.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",

This case is compact and the phone snaps into it but also the cover closes to protect your screen and latches over to stay closed with a magnetic buckle.  Inside, opposite the phone is 2 individual slots for your license and credit card. There is also a money or picture slot behind the card holders.

Calls are clear and sound is good on both ends. On the other hand, for some reason they did not add flash to the camera on this phone, and the MP3 sound is high and tinny without other speakers. The touch keypad locks to keep you from accidentally activating it, which can be somewhat of a pain. Overall, though, this phone is small, sleek, attractive, and easy to use.

This seemed to be the perfect solution as it allows for the cup space to still be used. The cup spot has a slit on the side, which allows me to put a coffee mug in it. Extra bonus! It holds pop cans and mugs very nicely with rubber bits to stabilize them. They don't wiggle at all. A tall water bottle won't fit in it unless you move the phone holder part way backwards, but I can put my water bottle in the spot next to it. It holds a phone nicely without it falling out.<br /><br />My one complaint is that it doesn't sit in my cupholder very snug.  It's about 80% good at staying there, but sometimes when I pull a tight coffee mug out, the whole thing comes up. Or it waggles when I drive and my phone is in it.

I prefer to look at my GPS that way, and to look at texts etc. that way.  2) it requires a large flat space to adhere it. I don't have that in my car. On the center of the dash where I would've liked to put it there is a speaker or a vent of some type. In front of the steering wheel it is not flat, and to the side of the vent is too far away to see. So in the end it didn't work for me. But the quality seems good and from what I could tell it would stick really well if you had a nice flat spot to put it on. It just doesn't work for most modern cars.",

This one seemed to be the best mix of simplicity and still allowing her the futures she wants such as texting, camera, music, and limited Internet access.  It also allows me to track her with GPS tracking so that I know where she is at any given time.<br /><br /> We had it for two months now. And I can see there are some things I really like about it, and some things I really don't.<br /><br />PROS:<br /> GPS tracking for parent  (mostly accurate)<br /> Child can text<br /> Child can make phone calls with no limit on contacts ( unless restricted by parent )<br /> Child can access the Internet with some effort, meaning she's not on there much  ( websites can be restricted by parent )<br /> Has a camera  (decent, not great)<br /> Has an MP3 player<br /> Limited memory ( keeps my daughter from downloading too many apps/games, which I consider a pro )<br />Uses Google App Store<br />Added phone to my AT&T plan (new SIM card)<br />WiFi enabled<br /><br />CONS:<br /> GPS tracking is not always accurate. Sometimes it tells me she is somewhere she is not, sometimes it alerts me she has left the safe zone when she is sitting right next to me, but probably 90% accurate<br /> Because this is an off – market brand, you cannot buy accessories for it<br />Instructions/set up guide are very basic.  I've had to write to the creator multiple times to ask how to do simple things, and because this is an off – market brand, you can't google it<br /> Although there are parental controls for things like contacts and websites, it appears you can only turn on all of them or none of them and not restrict particular ones,  but I'm not sure about this as I haven't had to restrict anything yet.<br />Lost of features you'd expect if you are used to smart phones are not available on this phone. For example, you cannot send JPEG files in a text. My daughter and I like sending pics and you can't do this. The phone also did not come with Emoji's, which every child wants. I had to download a separate Emoji app and then contact the creator of the phone for it to start working.<br />After 2 months the screen is cracked in 2 places.  Because this is an off brand, you cannot get a screen protector or a case for it, so it is inevitable that it will get dropped and broken.<br /><br /> Overall, I think this is a decent phone for an 11-year-old.  I didn't want her to have a smart phone with full access to all apps and Internet use. So for that I like it.  She loves it. It's mostly me that is picky about it.<br /><br />I think the GPS tracking is decent for my child's needs. However, the cracks are a problem and I do not see this phone lasting a super long time. I think it needs a little more work to bring it up to snuff. And it would help tremendously if a case and screen protector were available.",

And since I was planning on using it inside of an electronics caddy (that keeps the cords coiled and out of sight) I had to use a Velcro tie to keep it coiled up.

Or you might come back hours later and discover the connection was lost and it hasn't been charging.  And forget using it WHILE it charges.  The connection is so fragile that using it while plugged in will surely cause the charger to come loose ever so slightly so that it won't charge (even though it would appear to still be plugged in).  If it had cost more, I would return it.  But it's hardly worth the effort at this point.  So I will just leave a bad review and hope to keep anyone else from buying this.  I say, keep looking.

I was nervous that my dog would 1)get bored of it 2)chew it to pieces 3)somehow choke on it since its smaller than what I meant to order. We've been so happy with this toy! She loves to teethe with it and it hasn't left any marks! She loves catching this twig since its not heavy or hard if it accidentally bops her in the face. This is a good treat toy; we've stuck peanut butter and treats down into the twig to keep her busy. It also kind of smells good; not a supe rubbery smell, but more of a fresh, almost minty smell, which pays off when our 11mth old comes back and licks us =] I got a funky color: orange and green mix; I wasn't sure if you could pick so I just hit the order button, but I wish I could've requested a color like one of the ones in the photo.

    "text": "So I've now purchased 5 different brands of screen protectors advertised for the 45mm. This is the first that covers the entire screen. However the aggravation of installing and cheap feel doesn't make up for it.<br /><br />If you've ever done a wet install then this shouldn't be different. But it is.  It's needlessly aggravating.<br /><br />Removing these protectors from their backing is maddening. Being sure to wet fingers, necessary to prevent your fingerprints under it, but makes what is already difficult even more so. You have to be very, very careful to not stretch or pinch it.<br /><br />Once off actually installing is easy, but forget a perfect install. Bubbles, bubbles and more bubbles. The solution provided is horrible. Letting it sit only ensures the bubbles and imperfections are permanent.  I can tell easily that this will peel up as soon as it “dries”.<br /><br />The feel is plastic fantastic. The same as any film you'd use but with a slight rubbery undertone, if you will. Honestly not looking for glass feel but this feels cheap. Like $1 cheap. The responsiveness is good, no issues with touch or swiping. Speaking of swiping, edge swipes will catch on the protector and you'll be further reminded there is a piece of plastic there.<br /><br />Where there isn't a squiggly wrinkle looking thing or bubbles that persist the clarity is ok. You know it's there, no way around it. It adds a glossy kinda meh to the screen that won't get better with time.<br /><br />I guess you need to ask yourself if complete coverage is worth the aggravating ugly result to get it. Not sure why the Series 7 45mm is so hard to make a full coverage quality protector for. I would suggest you do what I'm going to do…keep looking.",

Those were edge to edge on the series 6 and not called case friendly.<br /><br />So while these appear to be good, it's 1 star because not only are they too small for the 45mm, I was told they wouldn't be.<br /><br />If you own a 44mm Series 6 or 7 then these may be great.

Look at your phone from the back and then look at the case pictured, and you'll know if it's going to fit or not. Sheesh!",

When texting or trying to select anything using a touch screen, it makes it so much easier to select an image or to enter text — much easier and better than using my fingers to select text or to grab and move small images.<br /><br />The only problem I have—which may not apply to others—is that it is so skinny and slippery, I found it very difficult to hold because of damage to my hands. I solved this by putting a rubber and around it where I grip the stylus.  If your ability to grip has not been damaged, you probably will not have any difficulty holdIng this stylus.",

I also like the way it is slim enough to slip into someone's  backpack, briefcase, pocket or purse (as the case may be)--the previous Otter case was much thicker and made of a softer rubber, which was aggravating every time I tried to slip it into my purse. No more an issue... all thanks to my daughter who told me to order a symmetry case. It is made of a harder rubber substance, and fits my phone (SE) pretty well--albeit, there is a bit of a challenge to turn the phone off and on with the button at the top of the phone. The power input slot lines up with the phone quite well, whereas that used to be a problem with my previous Otter case. I guess nobody's perfect????? Hopefully this will protect the phone against accidental drops! (No accidental drops are currently scheduled).",

I will say that if anyone reading this has not experimented with the AMAZING benefits (Aromatic, Topic, Ingested) of essential oils I would seriously suggested you start TODAY!  Essential oils, along with supplement, exercise, and watching what I eat gave me back my quality of life! With that said lets get onto the product...<br /><br />Pros: They are extremely easy to fill. They look nice. Labels stay on well. Cap is sturdy. I personally like the blue compared to the amber color bottles. Nice tight seal. DOES NOT LEAK. I have tried several before and seriously had an oily mess in my purse. Bright side to the leaking mess was my purse became a diffuser every where I went :-)<br /><br />Cons: I am not a fan of the plastic roller ball. I usually use the metal roller ball and I really do like that better. The metal rolls smoother to me and applies the oils better. Not only that I really am trying to get away from everything plastic and replace with glass. The roller ball is the ONLY reason for 4 stars!<br /><br />Other than that I really enjoy these roller bottles. They are made well. I can take my oils with me and apply easily where ever I can and when ever I need them. Hint: They also make wonderful gifts for friends and family. They enable you to make your own creations and get creative. BE CAREFUL mixing certain oils with each other as they can have a reaction to one another that you do not necessarily want to be apart of...I use an app on my phone called &#34;Guide to Aromatherapy&#34;. It cost $6.99 on the app store and worth every penny.<br /><br />Happy Oiling!!!",

It's very sad that Nokia products are no longer made in Finland where product quality was as important as design. So it's a disposable phone that has a lot of great features and innovations.",
