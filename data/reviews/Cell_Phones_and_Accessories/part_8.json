When you have finished watching you lay the lens flat, and unroll the stand so it acts as a protective covering for the lens. When flat, the product is about the size of a standard notebook.<br /><br />The lens makes the phone image considerably larger, although the resulting image doesn't completely fill the lens surface. Still, I find it much more comfortable to watch an image that is two or three times bigger than a standard cell phone. This is a great travel item and will serve to keep kids entertained on the go.

This tray allows you to establish an organized charging station so that you can recharge multiple devices at the same time. The tray has six USB ports and comes with six small cables. If you get the wrong cables, there is a notice on the instruction manual that you can write the manufacturer and they will send you free cables. You can also use the cables that you already own.<br /><br />The tray has plastic dividers that easily snap in place which you can add or remove at your convenience. They are wide enough to accommodate phones and tablets even if your devices have thin to moderate sized cases. If you have a very large case you can either remove the dividers, or lay your device down beside the station.<br /><br />This is a very practical tray, but I don't feel it is ideal for travel because you'd have to remove all the trays to ensure they don't break during transport. It is perfect for a home or office. The dividers light up blue when the device is plugged in and charging, and there's even an on/off switch at the back (although we just keep ours on). If you've ever gotten into an argument because somebody unplugged your device to charge their own, this is the product for you. It provides you with an instant and well-organized charging station.",

I could get mine to fit in, but it just barely closes and the placement of the image within the framing isn't ideal.<br /><br />Second, there is a credit card slot on the front that is very tight. I almost bent my card in half trying to get it in there the first time. After a few weeks, it stretched, and then developed about a half inch tear on the side of the case.<br /><br />I like the design, and the case stays out of the line of the camera, but a little more durability would have been preferable.",

    "title": "Be Blackberry...Don't Be Apple",
    "text": "It took me about a month to decide whether I wanted the Blackberry Q10 or the Samsung Galaxy S4.  Eventually I went to the local Verizon store to actually handle both units and that made the decision quite a bit easier.  I'm a keyboard person, so I was very much inclined to the Blackberry.  I'd owned two prior Blackberries, and didn't feel like learning how to use a different phone.  Actually handling the phone showed me that the Q10 is exactly what I wanted it to be: a miniature computer that I can actually do work on (as opposed to a miniature DVD player that I can fritter away hours with playing games and watching movies).  After handling the two units, I made up my mind to go with the Q10, and ordered one from Amazon because they were $130 cheaper than my local store (I'll buy local, but you have to be closer than $130 in price).<br /><br />The unit arrived promptly in the mail and I had to go through the process of switching over my account.  This all went relatively easily, but I had a problem getting my contact information on the Q10.  Apparently the Q10 uses an operating system that is incompatible with the Curve 9370 which I had been using.  Eventually I got it to work, but I couldn't walk you through the process.<br /><br />I decided to wait a week before I wrote a review because I knew I would be frustrated as I got used to the new phone.  That little snafu with the contact list would have dropped my rating a star all in itself.  There are some quirks that you have to work around which take about a week to familiarize yourself with.  Once you get used to it, it's an effective phone.  Here are some areas that need to be discussed:<br /><br />Keyboard:<br />Let's face it, this is why we buy a Blackberry.  The Q10 boasts the ‚Äúbest keyboard available on any smartphone‚Äù and after using it I am inclined to agree.  At first, I thought the 9370 had a better keyboard.  The buttons are more rounded and it feels more precise.  But it's just a matter of getting used to the Q10.  The whole unit is a little bigger and this keyboard works just fine.<br /><br />Touch screen vs track pad:<br />Half the reason I prefer a keyboard is that I seem to have big, fat fingers that don't access the correct thing on a touch screen EVER!  I always get the item immediately above or below the item I actually wanted.  I had gotten used to the 9370 track pad because it allowed you to make your selections but never forced you to cover up your screen with your finger.  Plus, there are directional buttons on the 9370 that allow for a bit more precision when you're correcting a text.  However, the Q10 has a feature where you can place a cursor on your text and then slide it to the left and right which is effective for making corrections.  It isn't quite as good or precise as the directional buttons, but it is effective enough.  I'm getting used to the touch screen and it has some advantages.<br /><br />Constant Swiping:<br />The interface for the Q10 is really where it shows a bit of ‚Äúiphone envy.‚Äù  I don't know what the deal is in our society today that instills people with an obsessive need to stroke their phone.  Getting the Q10 to do something is the equivalent of petting a cat, and this is probably my biggest gripe with the unit.  With the 9370, for example, you'd see a flashing light that indicated a message, hit the unlock button, and scroll to the text message icon.  Boom!  With the Q10 there are a couple extra steps.  When you see the flashing ‚Äúmessage‚Äù light you have to 1. unlock the unit by pushing the button on the top 2. swipe away the initial screen (bottom to top swipe) 3. go to the hub (or go to the text message icon) 4. open the message.  It doesn't seem like much, but it's a couple extra steps that you have to perform every...single...time.  The whole sequence is the type of thing that is convenient for showing off the unit in a show room, but gets annoying during actual use.<br /><br />General Interface Irritations:<br />You have to learn a couple swipes just to make this unit work, swipes that start off screen and then go in various directions.  For example, to close an app you have to do a bottom to top swipe that minimizes the app where you can just close it (ironically, iphone has a BUTTON for performing this same feature).  Inside apps, a top to bottom swipe will open up options menu.  There are also menus that appear from right to left swipes and left to right.  The lack of symmetry kind of irritates me.  You have to think a little bit too much about which direction you have to swipe to get what you want.<br /><br />The Hub:<br />I'm not too excited about the hub.  To get to it you have to swipe all the way to the left to access a vertical menu that connects you with all your social media and email stuff.  However, this tool is a little too rigid in my opinion.  For example, I have 3 different Facebook accounts that I use for various businesses, but there is no option for installing 3 different Facebook accounts onto your phone.  I used to be able to just log in and out with my 9370, but that's inconvenient on the Q10 because every time you log into Facebook with the app it wants to download all your contact information onto your phone (I don't want the names of 5000 people I only casually known on my phone).  Sure, all you have to do is disable the ‚Äúdownload contacts‚Äù feature, but it's annoying to have to do it every...single...time.  This is the kind of thing that drives me nuts about Apple (and why I won't buy Apple products): the fact that the units are specifically programmed ONLY to be used a certain way.  If I'm going to buy a device it's MY tool and I want to be able to use it however I want.  Reoccurring automatic prompts for absurd procedures do not help me.  Programmers sitting in little cubicles thousands of miles away cannot conceive of how I want to use my device.  Don't be so ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù just sit there, shut up, and do what you're told.  If I wanted to be told what to do, I'd buy an Apple product.<br /><br />The Camera:<br />Ok, the thing that annoys me about all cell phones is that the cameras are always mediocre.  When is Olympus or Cannon going to make a camera which is also a cell phone.  To make a good camera you need a big lens!  These tiny little cell phone lenses are terrible.  Also, the lens should be in the middle of the phone for stability, and there should be a button on the edge of the unit for taking a photo.  Also, I'd like a button that instantly called up the camera (the 9370 had this) rather than have to swipe through a dozen redundant screens while the object I was trying to photograph scampers off into the woods.  Get rid of the rear facing lens (you'll use that twice) and give me a solid camera body with the cell phone functions.  That's how you get ahead of Apple Blackberry!  Not with a stupid feature that allows you to ‚Äúrewind‚Äù a group photo so everyone is smiling.<br /><br />Apps:<br />No kindle app and the .pdf readers are pretty much terrible for what I need them for.  I've downloaded a couple, they're garbage.  However, there are a couple nice camera apps, one even has a tilt shift feature that's kind of nice.  If only this took real pictures.<br /><br />All that being said, I have started to like this phone.  It is very much a portable office unit, although it still seems a little harder to navigate than the 9370.  Blackberry is on the right track with this, but they need to eliminate the clunky interface and produce a top of the market camera before they can really compete with the other phones on the market.  I think there's still room for Blackberry out there, but they have to be Blackberry and not succumb to Apple envy.",

My one concern is the top silver pivot ball, some reason they made it to where the little round part on top of that loosely spins and there's no adjustments to tighten that. I'm thinking when I hit bumps in the car, it'll cause it to just flop back and forth... But I'll test it in the car and come back to update you on it later. Overall it's not a deal breaker if it does move around, I can put a dab of super glue on the moving part and it'd fix it easily. Even with that, this is the nicest phone mount I've come across!",

    "text": "SO I got this thinking I can ditch my little bluetooth speaker I use outside and SURE you can, this thing gets PLENTY loud. You can turn it on and hear it all thru a room like a stereo almost. But it's muffled kind of... I am willing to bet this has something to do with it being rugged and waterproof. Even a cheap little bluetooth speaker has better clarity than this but it DOES have plenty of sound and being waterproof is pretty amazing. I think this would be a fantastic phone for any trades person, it's very durable feeling and seems very well made.<br /><br />The night vision camera wowed me, I went into a room that was pitch black and took a couple pictures and could see everything in the room! You'd be able to see faces okay but pictures are kind of odd, I have a big curtain with a printed beach scene across my bedroom window and the whole curtain shows on the night cam as just a grey curtain, you don't see any outlines of the scenery on the huge mural... I'm not sure how all of that works and it shouldn't be a deal breaker, just an observation that some things might not pick up in night mode is all. I'm still very impressed with the night mode cam and even if I don't use this for my main phone, I'll probably keep the phone around just for the night cam feature! Take some neat shots of animals at night and such...<br /><br />SO using the apps and everything on the phone- it's very responsive, not sluggish at all. The camera takes decent pics during daytime too and good video too. I honestly have no real complaints about this cool phone other than the loud speaker and I think it'd be hard to make a phone at this decent price point to be rugged and waterproof AND have a perfect sounding loud speaker. I don't think that phone exists. SO it's a trade off, a little clarity for it being rugged. Definitely a well made phone as a plumber's son I can say this phone will come in handy for trades people and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone!",

    "title": "AMAZING phone!",
    "text": "Was taken back at first by the slenderness of this but after using it a while and then using a friend's phone, their phones now seem fat. This one fits in the average hand much better! The fingerprint reader works well. The video quality on this is fantastic and the 120 refresh rate is absolutely a great selling point and why I grabbed it! The slow-motion 4k video is another feature that I love and works amazingly! It's been truly fun playing with the cameras on this! That being said, the front-facing camera is garbage and just almost unusable. I don't know what's going on but the picture is really blurry and grainy on the front-facing cam. The lens is perfectly clean so it's not anything like that.<br /><br />Call quality is great. Very clear audio there and the speakerphone gets plenty loud. The speakers for watching videos/ listening to music are really good and get pretty loud which is nice! The clarity and quality for those speakers are pretty impressive.<br /><br />Phone is very responsive and opens apps quickly. I did have a very annoying glitch going with the facebook messenger and this phone for some reason. The messenger was trying to put things in what it called bubbles and this constantly froze the keyboard no matter what I did. I restarted the phone multiple times, each time I get the same result trying to use messenger- phone freaking out and freezing up the keyboard. I found some way to turn off the bubble thing on the messenger and it stopped this issue. Other than that messenger issue, the phone runs flawlessly and I've had no other problems!<br /><br />I am on 5G with this phone which was a nice surprise! Overall this is an extremely impressive phone! Would I have paid this full price myself? Probably not. I feel like this phone should be a bit cheaper but then again it is pretty new, it might drop in price over time. Overall I love and recommend this phone! I initially didn't know if I'd keep it after reviewing it as I have Motorola I love but this phone is so great that I am definitely going to hold onto it!<br /><br />A minor annoyance is the lack of cases for this. For an almost $1,000 phone we don't have any otterbox style cases available at all, not even off brands! All we have are slimmer cases available anywhere you look.",

    "text": "This phone actually beats out my Moto G Stylus in MANY ways. In most ways this phone is so so much like it! The biggest con is the side fingerprint sensor which seemed cool up to the point I am using their included phone case! With the thin case on it makes it hard for my finger to make contact with the sensor, had they put the sensor on the back this phone would have been nearly perfect! The only other little complaint is the phone has no 3.5mm headphone/aux jack on it but that's a dying thing among phones anyways- you're now supposed to get the cord that goes usb-c to 3.5mm if you want to hook it into a stereo or an external speaker. The other missing feature of course is the shake to activate flashlight which I'll miss- I've tried using apps to bring it to this phone and it just didn't work out.<br /><br />It boots up really quick which is a plus. The picture quality is on par with the Moto G Stylus- it produces really nice photos! The screen is actually brighter than the Moto G and gives a slightly better picture. It has a really high definition screen, high clarity, and a big screen.<br /><br />Overall this phone is absolutely amazing for the price considering it's an unlocked phone with all these features! I've been using it for a while and only had it freeze on me once and that was because of Skype acting crazy (I've had skype freeze up many various devices, it's very buggy). Aside from that- I think this phone is nearly perfect!",

It has an LED display that depicts the charge percentage and will continue to shine through the clear(but shaded) case cover when closed.<br /><br />This earpiece is not without its flaws, sadly. If you get a phone call and you answer with your phone instead of the earpiece, the earpiece will keep saying that you are receiving a phone call during the phone call(muting both YOU and the CALLER). It has disconnected several times during phone calls and while google maps were directing me to my destination and did not reconnect until turned off and on again or re-paring it on the phone.

But love the glitter and texture on this and love the way it looks on my phone. Works great and sticks great to my case too. Love the idea of using a 3m sticker pad just in case with these too. Because I know these can be tricky on some cases so that's a great idea that I will remember if I change cases and want my popsocket to go with me. But loving it just the way it is right now.",

She is not very techy so I wanted to get something that would be easy for her to use and get her used to using a phone. I also wanted something that had large buttons so that it would be easy for her to push and use.<br /><br />This phone has ticked all the boxes I was looking for and has been a great starter phone for my mom. It has large buttons so they are easy for her to press and dial the numbers. It's nice and loud and she can hear anyone on the other end. It also has a nice loud ring so she can hear it even hidden at the bottom of her purse.<br /><br />She is still getting used to using a cell phone but she is loving this one and I love that I can get ahold of her anytime I need and vice versa.",

    "text": "I am simply in love with this cell phone. I originally had an older Samsung Galaxy, which I loved and still love but it needed to be replaced because the memory on it was just horrible and no matter what I did I never had enough. Not anymore, I have plenty of memory now with this Xperia and I can add up to 256 gigs more makes it amazing. I can do everything I want to do and more with this phone. I have a huge presence online so being able to post on instagram and twitter is a must for me but also Snapchat too. I can do all of that with ease with this phone as it is a breeze to use. I also love all of the personalization you can do to this phone also with live wallpapers and stuff. The phone itself works great and is crystal clear on my end and my callers end. It pairs easily to my wifi and is just great all around. I didn't think I would love another type of cell phone like I have the Galaxies but Sony has made me a believer in another brand of cell phone.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />Okay, now that I have had this phone for a while and really used everything I can honestly say that this is a great phone and I adore it. Everything on this phone works great, it's super quick and just awesome.<br /><br />Now, there is one thing about this phone that I would change. That would be the speaker! The speaker on this phone, sucks! I mean that too. Unless I am in a quiet room with nothing else going on, I can't hardly hear anything when I have the speaker phone on. It really is that bad. I use it all the time and every time I use it I have to make sure I am some where closed off from everything, nothing on so I am able to hear the person on the other end.<br /><br />Besides the speaker being junk, the phone is brilliant in every other way possible. It has more room than any phone I have ever had. I am able to fill it with apps, pictures, music, whatever I want and it runs as fast as ever with no lag or problems. Phone calls are great and clear, so long as you don't use the speaker phone, and the phone itself is sharp and handsome.<br /><br />If you can get past the speaker phone being pure junk, then you are going to love this phone.<br /><br />***If you don't like my review, please tell me why so I can make them better and more informed.

When I received this one I was expecting the same but after a quick read through the instructions and a quick download of an app that works with the selfie stick I was taking pictures within five minutes.<br /><br />This selfie stick is super easy to use. Just simply place your phone into the mount, plug the cord into the headphone jack, with my phone I would then go into the selfie stick app, extend the stick and begin snapping away. It's literally that easy and so much easier to use than all of the other selfie sticks I have attempted to use.<br /><br />As far as what the selfie stick looks like, I'm not going to lie that I love that it is girly and pink. Might not be everyone's cup of tea but I like it so whatever.<br /><br />Once finished just push the stick back to the normal size, fold the mount head down, which fits perfectly around the stick itself and place into the holding bag that comes with the selfie stick. I then throw it in my purse because it goes every where with me now. I really love it and love using it, especially when I want to get all my friends in the picture. Love it!",

Also, it's great that it has places on the inside to put your credit cards, extra cash, or license so you don't have to carry around a wallet or purse along with the case if you don't want to. It also seems to protect it pretty well also as it doesn't stick out of the case and if it were to fall the case would cushion the fall. The only thing with this case is that it does stand up and that's great but the tab that keeps the case shut gets in the way and doesn't want to flip back or anything so it does make it a bit of a pain to hold it back when you want to watch something. Other than that though it's a great case and I love the variety of colors you can get so you can match it to everything.",

However, it has survived perfectly and honestly I would totally buy another one and am thinking about it to have a choice between colors. This case fits perfectly on the 3DS and there is no chance of it slipping off or anything like that. The underside is covered in a velvet like stuff to protect  the 3DS itself from the cover.

I am very motivated to use bamboo products as often as possible as it's an economical and environmentally friendly material. This is a small box on the underneath that holds the top tray. The charging station can hold 3 devices or more. The front of the tray has two slots as well as the section behind it. This allows cords that are fed into the sides to peek out to charge smaller devices like phones. I find this is great for multi-device households. The kids don't take their devices with them once it's bedtime for good sleep hygiene. Instead, they are always fully charged in the morning. I use this as well while sleeping on weekends or when the entire household is at home. It helps any tabletop or desktop surface stay neat and tidy looking as it holds all of the charging cables.

    "text": "This works great on sunny days. I've had a difficult time finding full sunlight available to me lately during my regular waking hours, so I don't feel the charge speeds I get from the power bank most recently are a fair assessment. However, this can also charge in the same manner as any other power bank. Use the appropriate cable for your device(s) and you are all set. If you are using the solar panel feature with the power bank, I strongly suggest to use the charging panels to shield your device underneath from the sunlight to avoid over heating your batteries.<br /><br />Not only is the solar charger a solar power bank that can use an wall-outlet adapter, but it also has a flashlight with a couple different modes, a compass and it folds small. It has some weight to it, but the panels are fragile. Store this at the top of your pack, in plastic if you are going to be outdoors. Indoors, do not store in plastic to avoid the risk of mold growth. I may depend on this in emergencies, so it's important to maintain it in good working order throughout the lifetime of the lithium batteries within. This is handy for the times you may be venturing out into the wilds or traveling somewhere unfamiliar to you.<br /><br />This is great for outdoor adventures to have on hand in case of emergencies or at home in case of power outages. I feel the value is fair, for the versatile uses, but would not be ideal if used primarily as an indoor-only power bank. It would make a wonderful, thoughtful gift for the outdoorsy person in your life.<br /><br />Thank you so much for reading my review.

    "text": "The Ring Light with Stand and Phone Holder was a really nice surprise. This is actually a 2 pack of gooseneck desk clamps that come with 2 swivel ball-jointed adapters, a small 6\" ring light and a spring-loaded phone holder. The phone holder can accommodate a phone from 6.5cm (2 3/4\") up to 10cm (4\"). The gooseneck alone has a length of 58.5cm (23cm) from the surface of the desktop mount. The clamp opens to a maximum depth of 6cm (2 1/4\").  This should fit most desktops. The ring light has 11 different brightness settings with 3 different color temperatures. I like that the control is on the cord because it helps prevent accidentally resetting while manipulating the position of the light. Each part has the standard 1/4\" threading, so this can work with many different compatible components available from various sources. This is great because a reflector mount or clip can be used, different phone mounts, light weight cameras or different sizes of ring light besides what is included in the kit.<br /><br />The allows for filming, photos and lighting from overhead of the table/desk top, instead of only from the side as you would have with tripods. It preserves your table top space. I really like this to take photos of some desktop projects I'm working on from an overhead perspective. It also is great for those with limited floor space or anyone that wishes to avoid having their fragile equipment on the floor (especially great for anyone with rowdy animals or crawling babies and toddlers). I can have the ring light setup on my desk and no fears of my dogs running into it or knocking something over.<br /><br />On thing worth noting is that there is padding on the top side of the desk clamp. On the threaded underside, there is not padding. I've simply used a felt furniture pad on this to protect the underside of surfaces. I have a stash of these in my junk drawer. They're not at all expensive. You can find them in nearly any shop that sells basic home goods. It would have been nice if this was included.<br /><br />I've compared the price point to similar offerings and concluded this is among the best values. This is especially true considering that these are 2 separate goosenecks with an adjustable, secure mount. I would highly recommend the Ring Light with Stand and Phone Holder for it's versatility and value.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

You can use either a micro-USB or a USB A cord, one is even included with the case and instructions. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this. Also, it's cute, which is nice. It will stand out so you will not mistake your power bank from another if you live in a busy household.<br /><br />Thank you so much for reading my review.

    "text": "This is a nicer charging cord. I have a micro USB cord that's held up quite well and this one is just as nicely made. It's not the longest cord, but works well for bedside charging. It also looks really nice. My son goes through cords like... well, a teenage boy. I'm hoping this one will last a little longer for him.<br /><br />It's hard to buy charging cords without seeing and touching them in person, but I will not lead you astray, fellow Amazon shopper. I would be very happy to buy this from a local shop, so let the package come to you and save yourself some trouble of going out. Christmas is closer than it was yesterday, this would make a good stocking stuffer.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope you have found it helpful.",

    "title": "Not the Best Engineering, Not for Heavy Cameras",
    "text": "Endurax Cell Phone Tripod 60\" isn't sturdy enough for heavier cameras. A simple point-and-shoot or cell phone would probably work fine. It's stated on the box it will hold up to 6.6lbs, but I wouldn't recommend any more than 3lbs. The tension thumb screws lock into place with little nuts that will drop out of the head mount if you loosen too far, which is easy to do. If this happens in the grass, they would be easily lost. One of the tension thumb screws and nuts isn't pre-positioned, it's in a baggie and the instructions state how to place it. The other 2 tension thumb screws are already positioned, so I'm unsure why this is sent to customers without being fully assembled. The cell phone holder does extend to hold some of the wider phones, so that is nice. There is a remote included. I don't use those, so I cannot comment on that. The tension for the spread of the tripod legs isn't terribly secure, and without some counter weights, it could easily topple over. Usually, camera tripods have a hook to hold some counter weights, but this one does not. The legs are not terribly sturdy, so I certainly would not try a very heavy camera on this tripod.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a budget tripod for a light-weight camera, ring light or something else light-weight, this will do the job. It's not the worst tripod I have tested and reviewed, but it's far, far from the best. I wouldn't recommend this one because the nuts can fall out and be lost so easily, making it useless. If the nuts were securely placed, and there was a hook for counter weights, this would be a better value. If I do use this beyond testing, I'm adding some tape to cover the slots for the thumb screw nuts. I'm also not going to use this anywhere it may be accidentally bumped, or in wind because it's just going to topple over so easily. This would be better for very occasional indoor use.<br /><br />The two nice points I can find is that a carrying/storage bag is included and the legs extend easily are are easy to adjust.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",

    "text": "This is a more solid bike mount than some others we have tried. If you need something a little more sturdy, this will do the job. It takes a little more effort than some other types to remove your phone, but it's also held securely quite well. If you do short trips and need to grab and go, then this may slow you down a little bit. Each movement will require the thumb screws to be manipulated. It's not unreasonable to believe that with time, the threads will become worn and stripped. With regular use, this should last a couple years. However, it's solid metal and can withstand some conditions that simple silicone and plastic mounts will not tolerate as well.<br /><br />My son has been using it, and he likes it. There are two options listed, so make sure you order the one that meets your needs best. I do believe some others may have picked the option that had less parts and found the product to be disappointing, so that's something to keep in mind.<br /><br />You don't need anything other than a place to mount the Bicycle & Motorcycle Universal Phone Mount. It could also mount on nearly any other tube, like exercise equipment or a wire shelf.<br /><br />Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",

My son has had a few re-charges for his phone and wireless earbuds along with more power for some USB ring lights we used outdoors a few times.<br /><br />There's a bumper all the way around the bank, so these are great for outdoors.

It does exactly what I would expect. I carry it in my purse. I don't carry much, so overall it's not too heavy. It reminds me of having a 24oz bottle of soda in my purse.

The other problem is that the kids can guess the combination in 10 minutes if they just try one after the other.

I removed my screen protector, which had become old and spotty, and wiped the screen well.  Now the spots are gone and the protection is kicked up several notches!<br /><br />Now the good:  Well built, solid, buttons are easy to press thanks to rubber gaskets which they thought to add so that nothing is out of reach.<br /><br />Covers over two ports look annoying, but I think I can cut them off if I don't like them.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars and I'll never buy another case of a large screen phone again!",

I opt for a slim case to keep the phone small, then I add a tempered glass screen protector for the front and it generally protects my phone well enough.  Including protection from falls and scratches.<br /><br />Thomo Compatible with iPhone 14 Case is just the kind of case that I like.  It is slim at perhaps 1/8 inch thickness all around, made from silicone and lined with a soft felt so there's no danger of scratching the phone while taking it on/off.<br /><br />The silicone case itself has a silky texture that gives it a high-end feel and the color isn't well-represented in my pictures is a nice, dark maroon.<br /><br />Add to this, the built-in ring that I usually have to add to my phones to give me better grip so that there's even less chance for me to drop it.  Of course, the ring also serves as a kickstand for video watching.<br /><br />Now while most cases just come in a box, Thomo tried to set themselves apart by including a nice letter with little blurbs written by various people in their company.  It's a nice touch that gives the impression that they care.  The included sticker is nice too.",

    "text": "I really do love this watch band.  I pair it with my Galaxy Watch 4, although the listing says that it is for Galaxy Watch 5.  That's not to say there aren't issues with it, though...<br /><br />So instead of going for the sure thing that is the black silicone band, I went for the blue.  I think it really makes the watch stand out on my wrist.  The silicone is soft with a satin finish that is comfortable against my skin.<br /><br />This band has many nice features.  The soft silicone, as I said, is comfortable and flexible.  The clasp mechanism is a quick release that lets you take of the watch very easily.  To adjust the length of the band, there is a little lock on the clasp that allows you to adjust the band, then close the lock and the band stays in place.  This means that the band is infinitely adjustable so that you can get the perfect fit.  The clasp mechanism is magnetic, which is fine for the most part.  Magnets make is easy to clasp and unclasp the watch.<br /><br />So here's the big problem with this band:  The magnetic clasp.  While it is very convenient, it does come off.  I haven't had any issues with it coming apart during day-to-day use, but when I'm active (playing tennis), I do find that it comes apart.  Being silicone, this really should be considered a sports band and if the thing comes apart while playing sports, it kinda defeats the purpose.  I'll probably need to have a little velcro band or rubber band to keep the clasp closed when I play sports.",

I have personal gripes about their claims of it being more environmentally friendly, but I'll leave that out of this review.<br /><br />With that said, let's talk about this Type-C fast charger.  It supports 35W PD over Type-C.  On a Pixel 7 phone, it will support the maximum charging speed at 20W of power with power to spare.<br /><br />While it's compact, it unfortunately still takes up an extra plug space on my power strip.  The folding prongs makes this charger great for travel as it is super compact and just looks neat.

In this review, I'll be approaching this device through my previous experience with a similar [[ASIN:B09S9LP3D4 Portable Laptop charger (let's call it The Competitor for clarity)]].<br /><br />Both products boast an AC output and type-C PD.  They have similar ratings when it comes to their battery capacity.  This power bank does output 150W through its AC output while The Competitor outputs only 120W, which is why I decided to pick up this one power bank.  One additional feature that attracted me to this power bank is also its DC barrel connector output.<br /><br />In terms of the AC output, my laptop takes a 130w power supply through Type-C.  Both of these power banks only output 100w PD so my laptop, will charge but will complain about the lower power input, and thus throttle my CPU/GPU.  The AC output will give this power bank the advantage here.  At 150W, I can plug the laptop's charger into this power bank and my laptop will perform at full power.<br /><br />As for the DC barrel connector output, my hope was to be able to power my projector, but it takes a 19v input.  It's unfortunate that the output of this power bank is only at 12v.  Unfortunately, this makes the DC output on this power bank useless for me.<br /><br />One last departing thought:  The Competitor comes with a carrying case and can charge through USB type-C and this power bank comes with a DC power adapter with a barrel connector as well as a car charger, also with a barrel connector.<br /><br />Just as a test, I did plug in Type-C from my wall charger to this device and it does seem to start charging so I believe Type-C charging is possible on this power bank.<br /><br />Overall, I think that both are good products, but there IS a big price difference that you really need to have a good use case to justify.",

Designed to be charged through its USB Type-C/Thunderbolt ports, this laptop requires a 130w power source, otherwise, Windows will warn about a low-power device and will throttle the GPU and GPU.<br /><br />This 140W USB C Charger for MacBook Pro 16 inch 2021 outputs the necessary wattage.  It is very stylish and quite compact in size.  Compared to the standard charger, this charger is much more compact and easier to pack into luggage when the prongs are folded in.<br /><br />However, no charging cables come with this charger, which means you need to invest in a good cable.  When it comes to USB Type-C, every component of the charging system needs to be rated for the wattage you need because the voltage and amperage is negotiated by the charger, the cable, and the device itself.  If any one of those can't go up to 130w, you'll be slow charging.<br /><br />In terms of price, you're paying a premium for the Mac design aesthetics and add to that, the price of a good cable can be up to $20.  In the end, you're around $100.  Compare this to a standard 130w type-c laptop charger and you'd be paying almost double the price.<br /><br />In the end, it'll be up to you to decide whether the portability of this product is worth that extra upcharge.",

    "text": "I love this little charger!  The NEWDERY Magnetic Wireless Portable Charger is compact, fast-charging, and supports magsafe.  There is a single type-c port to charge the power pack with or you can use the port to charge your device if it doesn't support wireless charging.<br /><br />Just snap this charger to your phone and it will stay put without the need to mess with a charging wire.  It came in really handy just the other day when my phone ran low on charge but I needed to leave the house.  I just attached the charger and put it in my pocket.  It kept the phone working for the rest of the afternoon.<br /><br />I don't use an iphone so I purchased a magnetic sticker to stick to make my phone magnetic which then allows me to use this charger.  The sticker is about 1/8\" thick and doesn't work well through a plastic case, but I plan to cut out the back of the case in order for the sticker to fit through the case.<br /><br />At 10000mah, it serves well as a personal charger, but if you need something to charge multiple devices, you'll need to buy something bigger with more ports.<br /><br />The reason I gave this a 4* is that there are very similar devices out there that also have a fold-out stand to turn this into a phone stand.",

    "text": "I was going to do a full review with pictures and even sample video but the FeiyuTech Vimble 3 really disappointed me.<br /><br />Firstly, I tried to pair this gimbal on three of my Android phones and none of them were able to pair.  In fact, it had a very odd problem.  On the first phone, I installed the Feiyu On app and attempted to pair the gimbal.  No devices were found.  In the phones bluetooth settings, I searched for bluetooth devices and saw a bunch of things around me but none of them were the gimbal.<br /><br />For sanity check, I checked the other two phones and they were able to see the gimbal in their bluetooth list, ready to pair.  I decided to give up on the first phone and moved on to the second phone.<br /><br />On my second phone, I installed the Feiyu On app and tried to pair.  Unable to find a device and after that, the device no longer showed up on the phones bluetooth list.  The app did something to the phone where it no longer sees the gimbal.<br /><br />Reluctantly, I decided to try on my daily driver.  The phone that I have in my pocket every day.  This time, I paired the gimbal through bluetooth first, then installed and launched the app.  The app found the gimbal but warned me not to pair it with the phone through the system's settings.  It let me connect anyway.  I took the opportunity to update the firmware on the gimbal but I really don't want to use my daily driver as the phone I want to use with this gimbal.<br /><br />So back to my other two phones.  Try as I might (reinitializing the gimbal and unpairing the bluetooth according to Feiyutech's FAQ page), the other two phones still wouldn't see the gimbal.  I even factory reset one of them.  The change to the phone is permanent!<br /><br />On my main phone, I decided to give up on the whole thing and unpair the gimbal and delete the app.  Guess what?  After unpairing, my main phone no longer sees the gimbal anymore.<br /><br />Something really fishy is going on.",

There is no pressure sensitivity, no tilt sensitivity, and no soft tip for a paper feel.  The advantage that it has over a standard capacitive pen is that it is more accure, but then you don't need to charge a capacitive pen.<br /><br />This stylus comes with three tips but that's really just for show.  You will never wear the tip out because it is hard plastic and doesn't have any sort of paper-like feel.  It takes a little getting used to because I prefer more friction when I'm writing and so my handwriting isn't quite the same as when I write on pen-and-paper.<br /><br />If you don't want to spend $100 on an original Apple and you don't need any of the fancy tilt and pressure sensors, this will work just fine for you.

I'm not going through the litany of cable types out there suffice it to say that when it comes to cables required by Oculus, you need one capable of high-speed data.

You the add the fact that you will need a very long cable in order to be tethered to your PC, the price can get outrageous.<br /><br />Thankfully, the popularity of the Oculus Quest headsets, there is a market for cables that meet these two requirements and along with that market comes competition for price.  So now that the early adopters who purchased the Quest/Quest 2 at the get go helped create this market, we can take advantage of the new, lower prices of these cables.<br /><br />The FBesteam Quest Link Cable 16FT/5M is a thick braided cable that is fairly stiff (which is a minus when it comes to tethering and moving around), but performs well with Oculus Link.<br /><br />On my laptop, the Type-C port may have outdated drivers or firmware so I'm unable to use the Type-C to Type-C cable by itself.  I was forced to use a Type-A to Type-C adapter.  The quality of the image is better than the wireless options and the data rate is fast enough for what I need.<br /><br />Overall, a good cable.",

I even had the DJI Pocket connected to my phone for most of the second day.  I can't describe how big of a difference it makes not having to worry about how much battery life is left in the camera.<br /><br />The mini tripod helps to extend the length of the handle, meaning when doing selfies, the camera can be placed far enough to frame my face along with other subjects that I want to keep in the background.  Open that tripod up and set it down anywhere to include myself in the shot.  I also set the tripod down to take panorama shots that is programmed into the DJI Pocket.<br /><br />Such a great experience!",

    "text": "As declared in its listing title, this charger was made for Apple devices.  When used with Apple devices, there is one charging coil for the phone, another for the Airpods and there is a mounting hole to mount the charger for the Apple watch that can supposedly plug into the USB port on the side of the device.  As a bonus, it comes with a selfie light.<br /><br />This wireless charger comes with a wall adapter that can output 5V 3A, 9V 2A, or 12V 1.5A and is rated for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0.  This means that by itself, the wall adapter can charge some hefty devices from tablets to phones but it is not as strong as the newer Type-C PD chargers.<br /><br />I'm not an Apple user so my experience is with an LG V40 and a pair of wireless earbuds that supports wireless charging.  What I found is that the 15W wireless charging can charge the phone very well, even though my phone's coils don't line up perfectly with the charger (again, the stand is designed for Apple phones).  It can also charge the earbuds to full with no issues.  It just can't do both at once.  Whether it's because the two coils are stealing amperage from each other or because the wall adapter isn't strong enough, I'm uncertain.<br /><br />With this experience, I believe that this charger probably can't charge three Apple devices together if the watch charger is plugged into the stand's USB port.<br /><br />Overall, I still like this charger because my earbuds generally don't need to be charged daily and the stand makes my phone easily accessible.",

What better than a solar-rechargeable power bank to fit this bill?<br /><br />This power bank is not compact, in fact it is quite bulky compared to all other power banks I've purchased in the last two year.  It is not feature rich, there is no quick charge 3.0, the USB type-c seems to be for charging the power bank and not for charging a phone.  It is also not pretty, it looks like a Black and Decker power tool.  Those things aren't what you're buying this for though, right?<br /><br />After a couple of weeks of use, I found that you can gain one bar (there are 4 led's, one led representing one bar) with one day's exposure to the California sun, and one bar can theoretically charge my LG G6 about 20%.  Not too bad, I think.  In addition, there is a built-in flash light that, being LED, should last quite a while with such a big power pack backing it up.<br /><br />Basically, this device works.  It is advertised as solar-charging and that feature works -- slowly, as expected from such a small panel.  It is advertised as a 25000mah battery pack and that works as well.

    "text": "This review will be specific to T-Mobile customers.<br /><br />The big question for anyone interested in this product is whether it does what it says.  The quick answer is No.  But we need to  break down exactly what is claimed:<br /><br />My test conditions:<br /> - T-Mobile provider<br /> - MyTouch 4g and BLU Studio 5 II<br /> - Suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio<br /><br />As a comparison, I have a cel-fi provided by T-Mobile for free but needed another signal booster for my parents who are also under my phone plan.<br /><br />Setup:<br /> The setup for the zBoost is fairly simple.  An external antenna is connected by a coax cable to the booster itself and the booster is plugged in to the wall socket for power.  The next challenge is to find the right position for the external antenna.<br /><br />Tip:<br />As other reviews have noted, the separation between external antenna and the booster unit is important, but the manual suggests that it's the VERTICAL distance that's important.  It suggests a 10ft VERTICAL separation between the external antenna and the booster unit.<br /><br />Claims:<br /> - Dual Band (800/1900):  Searching Google shows that T-Mobile deployed the 1900 frequency between 2012 - 2013.  This means that phones older than 2012 will not work with this signal booster for 3G.  The MyTouch 4g did NOT work with this signal booster at all.  Not even for Edge.  The BLU Studio worked.<br /> - Up To 2,500 sq ft. coverage:  The zBoost fails here.  It's a separate issue from whether you've found the optimal position for the external antenna.  Holding the BLU Studio, I get 5 bars at 5 feet from the booster unit, but walk away to 25 feet and the signal falls to about 2 bars.  Walk to the next room and the signal disconnects and calls are no longer possible.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />First thing to note about this unit is how old your phone is.  T-Mobile started providing the 1900 frequency to attract iPhone customers away from ATT and coverage for that frequency is spottier than their already poor coverage (popular opinion, not mine).<br />Compared to the T-Mobile Cel-Fi, the T-Mo unit stays connected at 40 feet at 2 bars.  So while both units have very short broadcast distances, the zBoost is inexcusable.  Exclusive of whether it is possible to find an optimal location for the external antenna at your location, the lack of coverage from the booster unit negates the usefulness of this device -- especially for the price they charge for it.  I'd like to say that you should give the T-Mo units a try but the ones on Amazon are sold by individuals so you may not be able to return them if they don't work out.",

    "text": "Take away the bull$h** of contracts, SIM locking to carriers, and fancy &#34;finger print readers&#34;, build a solid Android device using a low-priced, but powerful chipset, now make sure to use IPS screens, next in Dual Sim capability,  and lastly, offer the device at a great price.  There, you have the BLU line of phones.<br /><br />BLU, Asus (with their line of ZenFones), and other companies are telling the consumer that the phone in their pocket doesn't have to be locked in to (or locked by) your Wireless Carrier and that it doesn't have to cost you the price of a high-end computer.  This is a great trend and I wholeheartedly support it.<br /><br />The BLU Studio 5.0 II is in the lower end BLU's line of phones but it is still impressive for the price.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-  IPS screen means the screen is bright and has good viewing angles<br />-  SIM unlocked means you can use it for any carrier as long as the carrier bands are supported by the cellular chip<br />-  1900 Band for ATT and 1700 band for T-Mobile<br />-  Bloat-free Android 4.2 is fast, efficient, and full of great functionality without the additional crap put in by the major carriers.  Really, do we need TV service from T-Mobile or ATT?<br />- Solid build.  Doesn't feel flimsy in your hand<br />- Includes silicone case.<br />- Dual Sim:  Have one phone for work and one phone for personal use?  Use one phone for both.  Calls coming to and called from each card are clearly marked to minimize confusion.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-  Low screen resolution.  Coming from a Galaxy S3, the lower resolution took some getting used to.  If this is important to you, look at the higher end BLU phones.<br />-  No LTE.  To be expected for this price.  No great loss for me since my LTE speeds usually are pretty poor anyway.<br />-  Some bad software settings (Reference my tips)<br />-  When using only 1 SIM card, there is always a warning in the notification bar that a second SIM is not inserted.  Hopefully, they will address this with an update.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />-  Set the APN.  The phone comes with a single APN pre-programmed, which is selected by default.  The APN is the address that the phone passes through to get to the Internet.  If you are having a problem with network connection, go in to Settings &#62; Data Networks &#62; Access Point Names and choose the APN for your carrier.  Don't tap on the name of the APN, tap on the radio button to the right of it and make sure the bubble is filled in.<br /><br />-  Only SIM1 can access the HSDPA+ network while the other SIM is limited to the EDGE network.  This is not really an issue since only the Android OS will only use 1 SIM to access the Internet.  You choose which SIM card ALL network traffic will go through so basically put the SIM that has the higher data limit in the SIM1 slot.<br /><br />-  Rename the SIM cards in your settings to better differentiate the sim cards.  Also select to display the SIM cards using the last 4 digits instead of the first 4 (three of which is your area code).<br /><br />So in summary, this is a solid phone with solid support for &#34;mobile&#34; usage (not so great for those who use their phone in lieu of a computer for everything they do on the Internet).  The truth that Samsung doesn't want you to know is that there is really nothing on Android that requires an octacore CPU, or even takes advantage of it.  In fact, while I have not tested XBMC on this phone, my Android HDMI Stick that also has the Mali 400 supports more codecs than Samsung's video chip.",

    "text": "I'm using this with the [[ASIN:B00EWCEHNS  Docooler Qi Wireless Charger ]] and my Note 3 in an S-VIEW case.<br /><br />As a charging receiver, the Zitrades pad works.  I don't get the problem that some users have with the charger turning on and off once the phone gets to 100% and charging speed seems good.  I hardly charge the phone through the USB port so I have no reference as to how long it SHOULD take, but I don't find myself thinking that the charging takes too long.  The charge time is probably helped by the Docooler charger since it as a full 1 amp output.<br /><br />As a bonus, the contacts are carried over to the back side of the Zitrades pad, allowing the chip in the S-view case to work.<br /><br />The final result is that there is a slight bulge to the back of the phone, and a spot that pokes out where the S-View case's chip sits, but the case still fits tightly and the S-View function works.<br /><br />I'm taking one star off because the answers above insist that NFC still works with this pad...  it does not.  I tried NFC with my wife's phone as well as my Samsung NX300 camera.",

    "text": "My first time repairing glass on a phone and it went pretty well, thanks to the S3 ProKit.<br /><br />The Glass:<br />-  Slightly tinted as it should be.  Another kit my friend bought had completely clear glass.  After installation, the clear glass looked drastically different from the original.<br />-  Thinner than the original and slightly flexible.  I wasn't expecting Gorilla Glass here, but the flexibility presents a small problem.  If you have a tight case on the phone, it will cause the glass to cave in, creating a dark spot where the glass touches the lcd screen.<br />-  Has the logo.<br />-  Touch function was not affected after the replacement.<br /><br />The ProKit adhesive:<br />-  Compared to another kit that came with 3M adhesive, the ProKit's design made it easy to apply.<br />  1.  Remove the paper from the adhesive.  You are now left with a clear blue film with the double-sided tape around the edges.<br />  2.  Pull the home/back button ribbon through the hole in the blue film (as described in the instructions)<br />  3.  Position the blue film as closely to the edges of the phone as possible and apply it in place.<br />  4.  The blue film is pre-cut in the top right corner.  Use that corner to peel the blue film off.  Adhesive is now in place.<br />-  While the size of the adhesive is correct for the phone, there should have been more of it (I'll explain below)<br /><br />The Toolkit:<br />-  Bunch of plastic and a couple of small screw drivers.  Not much need to be said about them.  They work.<br />-  My suggestion is not to use the tools to try and pry up the glass.  Start by using the suction cup near a corner and heat the adhesive there.  Use the cup to pull the glass up enough to jam the guitar pick in.<br /><br />The Instructions:<br />-  Instructions were in color and were pretty clear to me.  Combine this with a couple of youtube videos and it should be clear how to replace the glass.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The kit does well to replace the original glass.  Obviously, you will not get the same quality glass as the original but the phone will ‚Äúlook right‚Äù after the replacement.  My big problem with this kit is that I keep the phone in my front pocket and dust gets under the glass.  A lot of it.  Had the adhesive surrounded the home button rather than leaving the seams of the button open, the dust would probably not get in.",

    "text": "When I upgraded my phone to a Note 3, its larger size forced me to upgrade my car mount as well.  After my great experience with the original iOttie One Touch, I didn't look beyond the iOttie brand so my choice was now between the iOttie XL and the iOttie One Touch 2.<br /><br />With a $5 difference between the two, was the price difference justified?  For me, the answer was ‚Äúyes‚Äù.<br /><br />Building on the stand out features (namely, the soft suction cup/adhesive combination and the one touch dock and release system) of the original One Touch, iOttie made a couple of changes to the design that solves yet another problem that I didn't realize I had -- specifically, how far I needed to lean in to access the phone.<br /><br />The first significant change is the extension arm.  The advantage of this arm is to give you the ability to place the phone closer to you.  When mounted on my dashboard near the wheel's 2 o'clock position, I'm now able to extend the phone to about 3 inches from my hand.  This distance gives enough clearance to turn the wheel, but still close enough for me to touch the screen without taking my hands off the wheel, and without having to lean in.<br /><br />No leaning in means I don't take my eyes off the road longer than necessary when checking navigation waypoints or answering calls.  Not taking my hands off the steering wheel means my arm is more stabilized so I'm actually able to hit the buttons I was aiming for.<br /><br />The second significant change is that the joint connecting the phone clip to the mount base is now a ball joint.  It gives a bigger range of movement to the phone clip, making it adjustable to any angle.<br /><br />The distance between the mount's clamps is only slightly wider than the Note 3 itself so a Note 3 with a slim case can fit, but forget about trying to get a Note 3 with an Otterbox case in there.<br /><br />Overall, the One Touch 2 is a worthy successor to the One Touch and One Touch XL.  Well worth the extra $5 in price.",

I have been using this phone for a little over a week with no complaints.<br /><br />My phone in particular was an unlocked phone from tracfone. A word of advice when dealing with unlocked phones from different carriers...rival companies will tell you they are not compatible when indeed they are. I used this with straighttalk. They carry both GSM and CDMA sims so you are able to use these phones on their network.<br /><br />I have absolutely no complaints and am very please with my purchase.",

It may not be comfortable if you have huge wrists.  The metal clasp has a brushed finish (rather than high polish) which is nice because small scratches aren't so noticeable.  The material is very stretchy (like a hairband almost) and comfortable.  Since it's going to be stretching often as you wear/remove it, you might want to buy a second one if you like it.  Watch bands (except high quality solid metal) don't last forever and even after only 1 year of normal wear my $100 Apple watch band (magnetic) looks very worn, and one of the connectors has broken.

    "title": "Maybe the best looking case for iPhone",
    "text": "This is easily the best looking case among the clear/mostly clear group of cases I've seen and/or tried.  It's surprising how many ugly, clunky rubber phone cases exist and why anyone would spend $1000+ on a beautiful new device and then throw an ugly colored rubber case on it to make it look like a child's toy.  If you want a case that offers some protection but also preserves the original look of your phone‚Ä¶THIS is it.  Anyway, the case looks just like the display image - shiny metallic edges/sides with a clear and VERY matte back to hide minor scratches and fingerprints.  The Apple logo is still easily visible, though.  Even though the sides are glossy and look like polished metal, they are made of hard rubber and are more grippy (unless your hands are oily) than they look.  I think the case would provide mild to moderate impact protection, but not as much as one of the big clunky rubber cases.  It's not a big rugged case.  This case may be tagged as slim, but it is not the slimmest, either. There is a slimmer semi-hard clear plastic case available on Amazon (under various brand names) which is slimmer, but it scratches and cracks easily (I owned that case too) and just doesn't look as good as this case does.  The edges of this case around the screen and camera are raised by a couple mm to provide some protection.  The back is thick enough that MagSafe accessories will not really stick to the phone, though. It can still charge wirelessly with this case on, but you will barely notice any pull from MagSafe accessories.  If you have a magnetic charging stand that is angled (maybe 45-60 degrees) your phone will NOT stick to it with this case on.  The case seems to be sealed well and doesn't get moisture spots inside when in humid areas like the bathroom.  One amazing thing about this case is the precisely cut holes and button molds.  The cutouts for the charging port and the side mute switch are cut EXACTLY and evenly - not even a half mm off, so they are centered perfectly.  The cutouts also leave enough space around the charging port for a cable's surrounding frame, and enough space that your finger can easily toggle the mute button.  The speaker holes are cut perfectly, too.  The button molds are raised just enough that you can feel them with your fingers (so you are not fumbling around trying to locate them) but do not protrude very much, allowing this case to slide easily in and out of your pockets.  I'm really amazed at how they got all of these little details right.  I would definitely recommend this case if you want a sleek, beautiful case that provides a bit of protection.  I wish they would make a MagSafe version of this case - possibly with rings painted to match the phone paint so they are nearly invisible.",

It has a good installation video guide, and I was able to install it with zero bubbles on my first try.  I think most people (who actually *watch* the video and follow their method) can do it, too.  However, I'm disappointed in the ugly lines near the middle third of the screen - check out the attached photo to see what I mean.  You will see those same lines with almost all of the other plastic film style protectors, though, to be fair.  The other thing I'm disappointed in is that this doesn't cover the whole screen - you can see the edges on each side are not covered.  This film is simply smaller than the 45mm screen by at least a few mm on each side.  You can see how much smaller it is in the photo.  When you are swiping from the side, to change your watch face, for example, you feel that annoying edge of the film.  I'm not sure why it's so hard for companies to make a film that fits the watch, but it certainly doesn't feel like 2022 when it comes to watch screen protectors.  The only one that was a close fit for the screen had a thick black border that actually covers the edges of the screen, and was impossible to install without bubbles.  Don't buy that one!<br /><br />Anyway, this film protector is better than nothing, for sure, especially if you wear your watch to the gym or anywhere where it can be scratched.  Remember - only the high end ($1000ish) apple watches have the sapphire screens - not all models.  So unless you have that model, your screen will almost definitely scratch without a screen protector.",

If you buy this, you may need to also order two (20mm for Galaxy Watch 4) push-slide connector pins in order to connect this band to your watch.<br /><br />The package contains link-remover tools (with 2 extra heads) also.  The chrome finish on the band looks nice on both sides but the inside of the band clasp has a rough unfinished look.  It is unlikely anyone will ever notice that though since the clasp is always closed when worn.  None of the fake diamonds are missing and I have to say that the band looks really nice with a silver/metal/chrome watch, especially for this low price.

    "text": "I ordered the 7-section metal band in black, and am fairly happy overall with it.  The small glossy in-between parts of the link appear darker than the matte/satin finished parts of the link.  In fact, the matte parts look almost more like charcoal gray rather than black.  While the contrast of the two looks nice (in my opinion) this band will probably not look like an EXACT color match if you have a glossy black watch case.  The links are easy  enough to remove with the tool provided and should be able to fit 99% of wrist sizes.  The band snaps in easily enough to the watch base, and the clasp buckles securely and requires you to press the two side buttons on the sides of the clasp to release, so the watch band doesn't accidentally come undone.  That solves one of the major problems that many other watch bands have, especially magnetic ones.<br /><br />The minor drawbacks to this watch band are:  1 - it sometimes pulls at the the hairs on your arm/wrist like many metal watch bands do  2 - the metal links are a LITTLE wiggly and make a bit of noise.  If you've ever owned a very expensive watch you know that expensive metal watch bands feel more \"premium\" and don't really rattle this way.<br /><br />Given the price, I'm skeptical about how long the paint will last.  If it rubs off quickly, I will edit this review and drop the rating.  If not, I think this watch band deserves a solid 5 stars considering it's low price point - for this much money you really can't ask for more.",

Only trouble I had was that i didnt realize that the green film on sticky-side was not covering the whole piece of glass.  It had cut outs where the lenses and sensors were located (See photo). So when handling the glass I unfortunately transferred finger prints and smudges to the glass, which resulted in poor picture quality.  Fortunately this kit came with two pieces of glass and I got to do the process all over again :-/  but it wasnt bad. Just tedious.  After using the tweezers to pull out the glass and glue from the original broken glass, I actually carefully vacuumed up any bits off the phone.  I then used a Q-tip and adhesive remover to remove the residue left.  Again, slow and careful.  I also squeezed out the Q-tip so it wasn't dripping.  Before placing on the knew glass, I debated whether or not to whipe off the lenses. I did and it was fine.  I tested the camera focus in both modes as suggested,  then put on the glass.  The second time I did it, I made sure there was no dust or smudges on the glue side of the lenses before I removed the film. I even wiped it down and used dust sticker",

    "text": "I've had the Razer Kishi for a few days now and I have to say that I am disappointed.  It works great with Fortnite on my Samsung Note 8.  Does not work with Call of Duty.  There is apparently a work-a-round (connect an xbox controller wirelessly to your phone and then the game will respond to the Kishi); however, for an $80 controller, it should work.  Games that have normal controller support (like Sega's Altered Beast for example) do not work with it.  The Kishi is advertised on Microsoft's website as THE controller for cloud gaming via Xbox Game Pass with an Ultimate subscription.  For something that is already overpriced, having to fork out more cash to play ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù games is another downside.<br /><br />As I already indicated, the controller is way overpriced $$$.  Wired Xbox controllers are going for $30.  The selling point of the Kishi is low-latency mobile gaming via the USB-C connection; however, for $80 there should be a Bluetooth option.<br /><br />Speaking of Bluetooth, because the controller does not provide a passthrough analog headphone jack, you are forced to use wireless headphones.  More $$$ to spend.<br />Another downside is that the pass-through USB-C connector is for charging only.  So you can't use it as a USB-C digital audio connection.<br /><br />Like the switch, holding the Kishi is sometimes awkward.  You hold it with your fingers. Your palms have nowhere to rest.<br /><br />Although not advertised to do so, when you connect the Kishi to a PC, it does not appear as an xbox controller.  The button mappings are mostly different as well.  First, the left and right trigger buttons are not even analog.  They are digital.  They show up as buttons 15 and 16 instead of +Z and -Z Axis.  The Xbox button, menu button, and view buttons don't even map the same.  The only buttons that do match are the directional pad.<br /><br />As I figure more things out (and more support is added) I will update my review.  But, for now, it is what it is...<br /><br />[Update]<br /><br />Wifi signal is significantly weakened when the Kishi is on the device.  Makes the phone unusable with games connected to the internet.",

Then it revived itself, but I couldn't get any uploads. In any event I thought I'd give this a try.<br /><br />I like that it immediately went and got all my info as soon as it was connected wirelessly. What I don't like is that instead of storing your recipes on the machine it is storing them in the cloud and therefore you have to always have a connection to get to your stuff. This is great, but when the Zombie Apocalypse comes, I may not have a connection, but I still might want to cook. :))<br /><br />I absolutely hate the new format that lists the recipes with their pictures, instead of just an alphabetical text listing. I don't have pics on most of mine because it's a pain to upload them. Now you have to scroll down through all these graphics to see the tiny titles beneath. If someone figures out a way to change this I would be interested to know.<br /><br />It operates very much like an Android phone so if you have one of those you won't have a lot of trouble getting around. The printed instruction manual is useless since it was written in China by folks that don't have a great grasp of the language and pigeon English isn't my native tongue.<br /><br />There is a nice feature that I got all excited about called Recipe Snap, that allows you to use the camera on the device to take a picture of a recipe and then upload it for transposing. Great idea except that it costs 1.00 each time you want to do that and can take up to seven days to show up. How helpful is that??? I have hundreds of recipes that need entered, so I guess I will be doing it the hard way through the website.<br /><br />Speaking of the website, it is probably one of the slowest I have ever encountered for doing data entry.<br /><br />The voice feature is an interesting twist in this new machine. It may be helpful if you can hear it. I have mine turned up as loud as it will go, and it is still kind of hard to hear over my commercial grade exhaust fan. I like that you can pause it, do a step and then start it again.<br /><br />Need to look for some screen covers as this seems more fragile than the screen on the old model and it is already splashed and messy after one day.<br /><br />All in all I am glad I got this for a reduced price and I think it will work fine once I get all the outstanding recipes caught up and entered. I would not have paid the original 150.00 asking price. I just noticed that Key Ingredient has lowered the price on their website to the same one as here on Amazon.",

    "text": "As someone who loves colored lights and all tech things I was excited to test and review this RGB Qi charger. I've been using it for a couple of months and have been really disappointed with the quality.<br /><br />In terms of design there are some facets that are quite good - your phone can charge through even a beefy case which is often not the case with Qi chargers, a definite plus.  In addition, you can charge your phone in either a vertical or horizontal position, which is great if you want to use the phone while charging.<br /><br />The ports on the back are handy for charging other devices as to keep everything contained and they work well.  It's handy that a super fast USB C port is included as this is the newest of charging technologies and definitely the fastest.<br /><br />Now on to the flaws in this device.  When manufacturing an RGB device why not have the colors mean something?  The light below the phone turns white when the phone is placed on the charger, white while charging and white when completed charging.  Seems like this would be an ideal opportunity to make use of the RGB lights in a functional way.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the noise.  Over the course of using this the last couple of months it has become louder and louder. I have cleaned the vents yet the sound persists.  I started with this on my nightstand therefore this was definitely an issue.  The sounds go from a high pitched screech to a lower pitched fan blade rubbing sound - both very irritating.  I have done everything I can to eliminate the sound without success.  After failing at this I moved the charger farther on my nightstand but it still kept me up so I placed it on my desk for use while working.  In the end, the sound is so distracting, the charger is in my drawer and not being used.<br /><br />While this RGB Qi charger could be a great device, my experience has not been indicative of that.  This is not a product I would recommend.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of dual use products.  The less electronics I need taking up valuable desk space the better.  I have always had great luck with Belkin products so when I saw this Qi Wireless Charging Speaker I was excited to test it.<br /><br />I set this up at my home workstation and have absolutely loved it.  I have used it with an iPhone 8 Plus, an iPhone X Pro and my current iPhone 11 Pro - each of them charge flawlessly and connect to the Bluetooth speaker without any problem.<br /><br />I can not speak to how well they would work through bulky cases as I don't use them.  I opt for thinner cases which I have found provide adequate protection for me and never disrupt wireless charging abilities.<br /><br />There are several characteristics I like about this unit.  I certainly would recommend the 10W version.  I have found with all Qi chargers not all of the power is going to transfer due to the loss through it being wireless.  This isn't a huge deal if you are using a wireless charger overnight but if you are like me, and have times where you need to get charged rather quickly, this pays off.<br /><br />The Bluetooth speaker is great for FaceTime calls (or video calling such as Zoom). Rather than being dependent on your phones speakers to hear the person you are speaking to the devices speaker and microphone take over producing far better sound quality on both ends.<br /><br />I often use this little speaker for listening to audiobooks as I work and it works great for that.  Now this doesn't have the sound quality of a Bose speaker but I didn't expect that.  In relation to the size the sound quality is really quite good.<br /><br />I have tested this product for three months now which is how long I've found is required to fully evaluate a product to see if it will develop issues and then be outside of the return window.  We have all had that unpleasant experience.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this 10W Belkin Qi Wireless Charging Speaker.  It has proven to be a well made, very useful device that will continue to reside on my workstation for daily use.",

    "text": "When we invest what we do in an iPhone it's important to protect the most vulnerable part of the device which is the screen.  I always keep tempered glass protectors on my iPhones to protect the screen - I have one placed on my phone prior to ever using it for the first time.<br /><br />I used this set with my iPhone X and they held up incredibly well.  I tend to be rough on my phone - I don't try to be but I just have crazy things happen.<br /><br />These screens have saved my having to have the screen replaced more times than I can count.  From drops to carrying my phone in my pocket with other items these screens worked exactly as they are intended.<br /><br />They are easy to apply - the key is to make sure your iPhone screen is completely clean and free of dust particles.  The set comes with everything you'll need.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of with this set is there is an upper cut out for the cameras at the top of the screen.  Many of the new screen protectors have this so they don't interfere with Face ID - this leaves this portion of the screen unprotected so  if by chance there is a pressure point impact in that area, it can still break your screen.<br /><br />That being said, I had no issues with these protectors on my iPhone X.  This is an outstanding deal for 3 screen protectors that you can count on to protect your investment.",

It only makes sense - we carry them everywhere and often don't think about wiping them down.<br /><br />This phone sterilizer by SMARTURTLE is a great solution to this issue. By getting in the habit of using this to charge and sterilize your phone each day you'll be guaranteed to carry around far fewer germs.<br /><br />Within the sterilizer box there is a Qi charger which I've found works without any issue.  After plugging the unit in you'll be greeted with a voice welcoming you.  Place your phone or any other object of similar size or smaller within and press the button on the left.  The unit will say disinfection in process - the UV light will illuminate and run through the cycle.  There is a button to the right that allows for the use of aromatherapy oils if you wish to freshen scent.<br /><br />Ultra Violet light, such as used by this unit, is what hospitals often use to decontaminate equipment.  It has been clinically proven to kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria.  The size of this unit is ideal easily fitting both our iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X Plus with their cases still on.<br /><br />We have thoroughly enjoyed having this product and feel this is an easy way to keep our phones free of harmful germs and bacteria.

    "title": "AMAZING CELL PHONE BOOSTER SET for LARGE SIZED HOMES & YARDS!",
    "text": "There are few things more frustrating than not having a cell phone signal at your home.  Currently many families have dropped their landlines and rely solely on their cell phones so maintaining a strong, dependable signal is more important than ever.<br /><br />I've had the opportunity to test and review a few different versions of the HiBoost cell phone signal boosters.  There are some differences between the systems but each of them work really well.  Depending on your specific requirements and area you need to cover, you should determine which set will best suit your needs.<br /><br />This review is specific to the HiBoost 10K Smart Link for coverage of 4,000 - 10,000 square feet.<br /><br />It is important to understand that these systems require INSTALLATION - IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL JUST PLUG IN AND HAVE A BOOST IN YOUR SIGNAL.  That being said, I did not find installation overly difficult - although it did require a bit of time.  YOU WILL HAVE TO GET ON YOUR ROOF AND RUN WIRE.  If you are unwilling to do this, or hire someone to do it for you, this is not a product for you.<br /><br />In regards to this antenna booster set - it is absolutely professional grade.  While there are other ‚Äúcell phone boosters‚Äù that attach to your phone but do nothing this utilizes an exterior antenna that relays the signal to the interior module which then boosts the signal prior to sending it to the interior antenna which provides the entire house (and yard) with a solid signal.  I am far from a cell phone signal expert - I followed the instructions and installed my set and my signal strength more than doubled.<br /><br />I used to have a few dead spots within my house which would drive me crazy - but those are gone.  While I used to have 1-2 bars within my house, I now have a solid 4-5 bars - and no dropped calls.  While it is still true that the farther you move from the interior antenna, or the more obstacles (walls) blocking the signal, the weaker the signal is that you receive, I found with this set, the signal is amplified to such a degree that the loss of signal didn't hamper reception.<br /><br />This set is PERFECT if your cell signal is weak, or you have dead zones within your home or office, and you need to boost it so you can rely on your cell phone.  This will boost not only your ability to call without reception being lost but data will transfer more quickly and reliably over your cellular service.<br /><br />I can see how this set could be especially helpful for those who travel in an RV or camper.  It would only require hoisting the exterior antenna and fixing the direction in order to pick up the closest cell tower and then regardless of where you are located you will have cell phone reception.<br /><br />Something to note - the app is quite invasive with the information it requires and really does not do anything that can not be done using the LCD screen on the interior unit.  Personally I'm leery of foreign apps that require personal information in order to register them.  Due to the type of device that this is, I was not willing to risk the security breech on my network.  You'll have to decide if it's worth the risk for you.<br /><br />In my extensive testing I found that the effective range in real world conditions, such as within my home, through walls, is around 8,500 - 9,500 square feet.  This system boosted my signal not only within my house but also outside onto my decks and well into my yard.  The farther you move from the interior antenna the lesser the boosted signal but I still found a significant boost.<br /><br />I have tested and reviewed several similar products by this brand and others and this one, outperformed all the others.  All of the systems that actually work will have similar installation and set up procedures but in the end this set will provide you the reception that you want and need.<br /><br />This is a very solid, well built system that does what it claims.  While it will require a few hours to set up, I found it well worth the effort.  This is an excellent product that I definitely recommend.<br /><br />‚≠êÔ∏èAs with all Drew's Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

    "title": "EXCELLENT CELL PHONE BOOSTER for SMALLER AREAS!",
    "text": "There are few things more frustrating than not having a cell phone signal at your home.  Currently many families have dropped their landlines and rely solely on their cell phones so maintaining a strong, dependable signal is more important than ever.<br /><br />I've had the opportunity to test and review a few different versions of the HiBoost cell phone signal boosters.  There are some differences between the systems but each of them works really well.  Depending on your specific requirements and area you need to cover.<br /><br />It is important to understand that these systems require INSTALLATION - IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL JUST PLUG IN AND HAVE A BOOST IN YOUR SIGNAL.  That being said, I did not find installation overly difficult - although it did require a bit of time.  YOU WILL HAVE TO GET ON YOUR ROOF AND RUN WIRE.  If you are unwilling to do this, or hire someone to do it for you, this is not a product for you.<br /><br />This review is specific to HiBoost MINI signal booster for Home and Office up to 500~2,000 Sq.Ft.<br /><br />In regards to this antenna booster set - it is absolutely professional grade.  While there are other ‚Äúcell phone boosters‚Äù that attach to your phone but do nothing this utilizes an exterior antenna that relays the signal to the interior module which then provides the entire house with a solid signal.  I am far from a cell phone signal expert - I followed the instructions and installed my set and my signal strength doubled.<br /><br />I used to have a few dead spots within my house which would drive me crazy - but those are gone.  While I used to have 1-2 bars within my house, I now have a solid 3 with far fewer drops.  The farther you move from the interior antenna, or the more obstacles (walls) blocking the signal, the weaker the signal.<br /><br />This set is PERFECT if your cell signal is weak, or you have dead zones, and you need to boost it so you can rely on your cell phone.  This will boost not only your ability to call without reception being lost but data will transfer more quickly and reliably over your cellular service.<br /><br />I can see how this set could be especially helpful for those who travel in an RV or camper.  It would only require hoisting the exterior antenna and fixing the direction in order to pick up the closest cell tower and then regardless of where you are located you will have cell phone reception.<br /><br />Something to note - the app is quite invasive with the information it requires and really does not do anything that can not be done using the LCD screen on the interior unit of the other models but I found with this model the app is required to fine tune, and get the most out of your antenna.  Personally I'm leery of foreign apps that require personal information in order to register them.<br /><br />In comparison to the other HiBoost Cell Phone Signal Booster Sets this one lacks the LCD screen on the interior booster and does not have the power the others do.  It would be adequate for small areas where you are not trying to broadcast through many walls.  It is definitely a quality unit - it's just suited for smaller areas.<br /><br />This is a very solid, well built system that does what it claims.  While it will require a few hours to set up, I found it well worth the effort.  This is an excellent product that I definitely recommend.<br /><br />‚≠êÔ∏èAs with all Drew's Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

    "title": "Wow!  The BEST Stylus Pen I've Seen!",
    "text": "As someone who spends a lot of my time in front of a screen working on graphic design or writing I've used many stylus pens but this one really is better than any of the others I've used.<br /><br />There are many Stylus pens that have a pen on one side and the stylus on the other - this pen is so much more than that.<br /><br />This pen has four distinct tips built into the one unit - each end has a cap with a tip and then beneath those are the other tips.  In addition to that, this set comes complete with a vinyl carrying case and replacement tips for each of the four tips.<br /><br />The Stylus tips are INCREDIBLE.  As someone who does a fair amount of graphic design using a touch screen I have used more Stylus pens than I can remember - this one performs just as well as those that I've spent ten times as much on.<br /><br />At first appearance it may seem all Stylus tips are about the same - that is not the case.<br /><br />The basic rubber stylus nub is the perfect density - not giving too much where it flattens and makes too much contact with the screen allowing adequate control.<br /><br />The metal mesh tip is excellent for blending, color editing / correction and general image manipulation within graphic programs.<br /><br />The clear disc tip is AWESOME.  I've only used one other Stylus with this tip design and I LOVE it!  The clear disc allows you to look from the side to see exactly when the tiny stylus tip is making contact.  This is ideal for any fine detail work.<br /><br />Finally, the ball point pen tip is handy when you have to sign something or jot a note onto real paper.<br /><br />This is an incredible multi-use Stylus that, if you spend much time working on any touch screen - you will love.  In addition, this would make an awesome gift for any graduate, graphic designer or photographer who does photo editing.<br /><br />I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it.<br /><br />‚≠êÔ∏èAs with all Drew's Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

    "title": "AWESOME 3 Way Mountable Car Phone Holder with FAST Qi Charging!",
    "text": "[[VIDEOID:d00a098401fdbf75993b74498effdac1]] I have tried, tested and reviewed several car cell phone holders and this one is definitely one of the best ones.<br /><br />Assembly and installation was quick and straightforward.<br /><br />The unit can be mounted via three different methods within your vehicle.  The set comes complete with 3 different brackets: a gooseneck stand that is attached to a cup sized weight, allowing the stand to rest within a cup holder; on a vent clip bracket, allowing for either vertical or horizontal mounting; or on a bracket that can be attached via 3M double sided foam tape to any smooth surface within your vehicle.<br /><br />I tested each method and they all worked perfectly.  For the cup holder method, when you twist the cup from the neck, three wings extend which help snug it within your cup holder. The vent clip worked equally well securing tightly to my air-vent without falling as we traveled.  The third bracket mentioned that can be attached to smooth surfaces has the same ball joint at the other end allowing for complete control of viewing angle.<br /><br />The bottom feet of the phone cradle are easy to adjust so the Qi charger falls at the correct level to charge your phone.<br /><br />Once plugged in the side arms immediately open to accept the phone as it detects motion in front of the phone charging cradle.  Once the phone is placed a light sensor detects the phone and automatically secures the phone by the arms squeezing inward. To release you simply touch the small metal sensor on either side.<br /><br />The Bolt Car Mount has an internal battery so even if you cut the power to the unit, it will still open the arms by pressing the button.<br /><br />THIS SET DOES NOT INCLUDE AN USB 3.0 CAR CHARGER - while many other sets do. Power can be delivered by either a Micro USB Cable (not included) or a USB C Cable (included).<br /><br />The average charging speed in my tests using my iPhone 8 Plus was 6% per 10 minutes - on par with other similar devices.<br /><br />This is a very high quality set complete with 3 brackets allowing for multiple ways to mount for less expense than similar sets that only include one mounting method.  While it does not come complete with the USB 3.0 Power Adapter, many vehicles do not require that as USB ports are built in to newer vehicles.<br /><br />This Qi Charging Set for vehicles is among the very best I have had the opportunity to review and at this price point I would not hesitate to recommend it.<br /><br />‚≠êÔ∏èAs with all Drew's Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

    "text": "This is one of the coolest new products I've seen for a while - and it works GREAT.<br /><br />As soon as I saw it, I thought, why has no one thought of doing this before!!!<br /><br />The frame is a beautiful, modern black wood frame that holds a 5x7 picture.  The photo has to be portrait oriented as the frame must stand on the smaller side.<br /><br />The Qi charger that is built into the frame charges at up to 10 watts depending on what wattage adapter the power cord is plugged into.  The power cord was more than long enough for me to reach my adapter with ease.<br /><br />The frame accommodates my iPhone 8 Plus in its Lifeproof SLAM Series case (and would in other minimalist cases) but if you use bulkier cases, such as an Otterbox Defender on an iPhone Plus (or similar sized phone) it will not fit.<br /><br />The lights on the reverse side of the frame indicate when your device is charging (blue), fully charged (green) or if there is a foreign object interfering with charging, such as a metal plate or if your case was too thick (flashing blue).<br /><br />Based on the complaints I read, I recommend people measure their phone within their case to make sure it falls within the 165mm height restriction.  Typically if your case falls within that it will not have a back thicker than 3mm.<br /><br />The only thing that I would improve on this product would be to add a small mat and make the frame a little larger to accommodate phones with slightly bulkier cases.<br /><br />As far as my tests went, I found this to be an awesome product that worked flawlessly.  The frame is beautiful with zero defects and beautiful craftsmanship.  My phone charged super fast and rested securely within the frame.<br /><br />I am thoroughly impressed with this product and will enjoy having it on my desk.",

    "text": "I have tried, tested and reviewed more phone cases than I can remember at this point.  This is the first Emerge Case I've had the opportunity to review and it definitely has some strong points but it also misses the mark in a few critical aspects.<br /><br />Firstly, it fits my iPhone 8 Plus perfectly - all buttons work, switches are easily accessible, cable ports free of obstacle and sound ports are unobstructed.<br /><br />The case is definitely hard and withstood our stress tests without issue.  Emerge utilizes a honeycomb pattern with their plastic manufacturing of this case making it extremely rigid and strong. The corners are reinforced and would provide adequate protection if impacted there.<br /><br />The black and silver is a classic, clean look that will always be in style.<br /><br />While Emerge bills this as a Grip Case our tests found that this case is actually harder to grip than any of the other 5 we tested.  While there is a slight texture cut into the surface the material is hard and tends to slide from the hand while rubberized materials stick.<br /><br />Another area of concern is that this case is nearly completely flush with the LCD glass screen of the phone - providing no protection from a flat face fall.  This fact alone, unfortunately, makes this case a non contender as to one I'd recommend for protection.<br /><br />The LCD glass is the number one thing damaged on mobile phones and should be a primary area any good case protects - this one fails.<br /><br />While this is a really nice looking case and will protect in corner and rear impacts it will not protect the LCD glass screen in any impact to the front.",

As a general rule the Lifeproof brand has stood up to long term use and intense stress tests without fail.<br /><br />This is a solid case that fits well around the iPhone 8 Plus.<br /><br />Installation requires the use of an included Lifeproof key to unsnap the 2 pieces of the case prior to inserting the phone and then snapping it back together.<br /><br />The glass LCD screen is protected from a direct fall by a rubber bumper that stands approximately 1.5mm above the surface.  A glass screen protector should still be applied and that IS NOT INCLUDED.<br /><br />All of the buttons are accessible but require additional pressure to activate - a noticeable amount of additional pressure is required for the volume buttons.  The mute button is approximately 5mm within the side of the case and is a bit difficult to switch.<br /><br />I had no issue plugging an Apple charging cord into the bottom port.<br /><br />Sound comes through the speaker holes at the bottom without issue and the microphone is uncovered allowing for clear pickup on calls.<br /><br />While many Lifeproof cases are known for being completely waterproof - this is not that type of case.<br /><br />While this case does add a minor amount of bulk and weight it is not a burdensome quantity for the protection provided.<br /><br />This is a really sturdy, nice looking case that I think would be ideal for most adults who aren't particularly rough on their phones.",

I set it to low setting and the room is large, at that setting the room looks like it has dimmer switch but bright enough too see everything in the room no problem. This particular test is to see how long it will run the led lights on low. I've had it on continentaly thus far for 8 hours and when I checked how much power the unit had left suprising to me it's still at 4 blue bars which is near 100% and that's amazing! With this who needs candles in an emergency! The test will continue to see how long it can go at this rate I'm sure more than 24 hours continuous. The led panel doesn't even get warm to the touch considering it has been on 8 hours straight. For me just as a backup light it was well worth the money! Would get it just for this feature alone!

Strange as the stylus itself feals solid they should design a better battery compartment perhaps make it aluminum like the pen body, because in plastic it won't last and will fail after changing the batteries a few times. Shame because love it, minus the issues it has a great feal and response.  Returning it because battery in mine was swollen and the unit stopped working even after I tried a new battery.",

She uses it at her job and will hang her phone so she can use with ease.  She's had zero issues with phone falling out or slipping, it will stay where it's out until she peels it off.  The magnetic properties is the beat feature by far in her opinion.  The card holders and other slots are just a small bonus for her.  The cases finish and look is very sleek and nice.  It seems to hold up well with everyday work use and ahes happy with that as well.  I plan on buying myself one in the near future.

It is pretty and it is a thicker plastic but I still wouldnt trust a simple fall..  it fits her phone perfectly and shipping of course was quick.  Over all it makes my wife smile and that fine with me.  As long as she replaces her phone if it breaks.. lol.<br /><br />I've learned from past experiences if its dazzling pretty, theres a reason and heres how I see it.  If a good phone case, with normal plain colors cost 30$..  then that same good case dazzled up will cost 40$ or more.  There is a reason why the good cases arent dazzled... it will cost to much to make them special and at same time good protection.  we the consumer dont wanna pay the extra $$ for good and dazzled.  So they dazzle the cheap ones to catch your eyes while using a cheaper plastic to meet the price range most peeps will pay.  So either you pick special and cheap or plain and good.. most times you cant have both at a good price.  Just something to think about.<br />Just make sure your aware of the \"inside\" info stated above.  There really is a reason why it's either special of strong and not both.<br />I will update if anything changes.<br /><br />I have not been paid for ANY review I've ever left.

    "text": "THIS IS A GIMMICK!!!  DO NOT BUY and USE on your  $1000 PHONE!! Heres why,<br /><br />it does not stick to a phone case and heres how I know it's a total waste of 5$ and possibly having to replace tour very expensive phone. There is NO instructuons,( I know it's pretty straight forward but) do you have to press strap to case for a certain amount of time?  Do u need to clean case before applied? Do you not need to clean case before you apply?  Do you have to apply with case hotter than room temp?  Point being,  There should be a little guidance especially when it WILL NOT HOLD!!!  This way I'm not trying 100 different ways thinking it's my fault and not just a cheap piece of junk..<br /><br />Bought a brand new case along with this item. Both came same day in same package.<br />Applied the strap to the NEW phone case and immediately upon sliding 3 fingers between the strap and phone it popped off and 800$ phone went crashing to floor. I'm not happy at all...<br /><br />2nd attempt to get the strap to adhere.<br />Replaced the strap to back of case but this time i held it in place pressing down for 6 or so mins. It popped off again immediately upon putting hand through the strap and phone. ch when it feel so thank god my 800$ phone didnt have a chance to break<br /><br />3rd time i pressed the strap to case for few mins, Then I let it sit for 30 mins without touching case and gave the adhesive time to set. I also made sure that I sat the case and srap in the view of a window so the sun light would hit the adhesive and maybe help hold like it supposed to, time will tell..  after 30 mins of waiting and a warm case. I tried the strap AGAIN.  Upon sliding my hand through the strap and phone YET AGAIN, immediately fell off.  OMG I'm done and sending this P.O.S. back tomorrow morning.  Yea its only 5$ but they DO NOT deserve to keep that money for crap that could cost people even more money when their phone falls to floor and breaks.<br /><br />Lesson learned here guys, when u have an 800$ phone do we really want to trust a 5$ strap??  I could've very easily been replacing my phone because of a cheap a$$ phone strap...<br /><br />DO NOT BUY unless u have a really cheap and replaceable phone.

So far the case is holding up nicely.<br /><br />My wife loves this case, just bought her a new s10, and she is in love with the color and didnt want to cover it up. The clear case with sparkles are right up her ally for sure.  Otter Box is an excellent brand I just wish you cared about samsung as much as you do iphones.  We (samsung) should get the same care and have a full incased Otter Box and not just the backing.<br />I dont have any complaints for what it is very clear see through no scratches of course very well made with thickness fits like a tight glove, easy to install, and most importantly I feel my 600$ phone is protected.<br />If you need a case always choose Otter Box they are beat in business for a reason.",

It will move around very easily on top of phone screen.  Even with an Otter case, (Samsung) it still moves around with ease.  This is a big issue for me.<br /><br />However it is thick and touch screen works ok (with settings in highest as instructed).  I dont know if it will hold up to their claims on the anti destruction power it's supposed to have and I'm for sure not going to test it to see on a 600$ phone.<br /><br />Im keeping it just in case because you really never know it just may help one day But I'm still very skeptical with the ease of movement of the screen protector.

    "text": "This magnet phone mount is super strong. I attached the magnet to my phone case, at first I put it on the iniside of the phone case and it wasn't strong enough. I moved the magnet to the exterior of the phone case and it's insanely strong. The base attaches to my car vent well and doesn't move when I detach the phone. It's a great idea for a phone mount. Would be really cool if they could get this to work with the iphone 12 magsafe chargers so it can charge and mount at the same time... Right now you have to remove the phone case in order to Qi wirelessly charge your phone. It wont work through this magnet. Even more of an issue if you attach the magnet directly to your phone.",

If I ever need two I'd purchase this again. The only and I mean ONLY issue is that I came with a small piece chipped off. It didn't effect the functionality or anything, it was purely a cosmetic issue. Also, there is a leveler on the tripod which is great to make sure everything is even!

The reason being the USB type C plug wiggles in the phones port. Despite trying to make several attempts to adjust the connection, I have not be able to fix this issue. The magnetic portion will stay attached but any movement and the devices charging is constantly interrupted. This causes the phone to cycles between no connection, \"fast charging\", \"rapid charging\" and we'll just plain \"charging\" when it can't decide.<br /><br />Mine may just be defective.<br /><br />The other thing to think about with this charger is you would want to use this type exclusively with your phone so you don't have to worry about removing the plug to use a different charging cable.",

    "text": "I am so impressed with this pen. I bought a different pen before this one that claimed it worked with the 6th Gen IPad, but that was a joke. I found this one in a news story from Tech Watch and thought if it was good enough for Apple to use with their display models, that had to be positive. I am so happy that I bought this.<br /><br />The pen really does work with this model of IPad. The device even recognizes it as an Apple Pencil. The touch screen sensitivity is amazing and the palm rejection feature works beautifully, allowing you to rest your hand naturally on the screen to write and draw as you normally would on paper.<br /><br />The pen is very easy to set up, light and portable and not all that uncomfortable to use. I like the shape, as it ensures that it doesn't roll off the desk or other surface when you set it down. The tip is durable and yet doesn't scratch the front screen of the device, which, I must admit I was worried about with the previous pen I bought.<br /><br />The battery life is pretty good and will let you write or draw for a good number of hours before it needs recharging, which you can do with the lightning cable that comes with the IPad. The top of the pen is connected so you don't lose it and it doesn't require you to do anything special to begin using the pen right away. The writing is smooth and you can read your handwriting when you are done writing, a vast improvement over the last pen I tried. There is very little screen lag time and so it feels really natural to use this pen.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, I think this was a great investment. You can also get replacement tips directly from Logitech, 3 in a pack for a reasonable price for when the tip begins to wear down. I am super impressed with this pen. I'd definitely recommend it to other shoppers looking for something that is just as functional as the Apple Pencil, with half the price tag.",

    "title": "My first experience with apple.",
    "text": "Potatoes potaaaatoes pc's and mac's. This is the first apple product I have ever owned. There are things about this phone that I really like. I will get to those first. I like the way you can delete apps from the front screen without having to go into your settings and struggle to find what you are looking for. I think the display is pretty good and the phone itself is quite sturdy. I like the design as I don't accidentally push buttons that turn the phone on and off all the time like I have had problems with on previous phones. I like that you have so many screens and storage folders that you can access on the front screens so you don't have to spend forever looking for where you put something.<br /><br />All of those things are nice, but here are my problems with this phone. I hate that there is no removable media. Good luck and best wishes if you want to add music to your phone you had stored on a previous sd card. With apple it is either feast or famine. You can pay a ridiculous amount to download the music you want from Itunes or you can try as you might to use the itunes software to download the music you did not buy from the apple store. I had around two thousand songs saved onto my previous sd card from my last phone and low and behold, only about ten percent of them successfully made it over to the iphone. I hate that it is ridiculously hard to add pictures to your phone unless you downloaded them from the net or your email or took them from the actual phone camera. I miss having an sd card you can slide out and edit the contents of from your computer. The selection of ringtones that come with the phone are a joke and in order to add new ones, once again (kinda seeing a pattern here) you have to go to itunes on your pc to do so unless you want to pay for them.<br /><br />Often when a phone call comes in, the phone pops speaker phone on and you can't shut it off without disconnecting the call. Sometimes it will refuse to hang up the phone call you are on. occasionally I lose 3g coverage for no apparent reason and the only way to fix this is by shutting off the phone and waiting a few minutes before you turn it back on. If you leave the phone off and don't touch it, the battery will last for days, but if you use it regularly, you had better have a charger nearby. I have had this phone for about six months and wanted to wait until I felt I was used to it before leaving a review. My over all opinion is that it isn't a terrible phone, but for someone who is used to an android device, it is bound to be somewhat frustrating. I would think carefully before getting an iphone about what your needs are and if this phone can fulfill them.",

I change cases based on my mood. Seriously. My wife makes fun of me for me. But it's worth it--because I enjoy case swapping. Here's the thing, since I've gotten this case, I don't swap cases anymore. This case feels SO good in my hand. It's not too smooth or too grippy. Sometimes you just can't quite find that right balance with phone cases. But IMO, Torras nailed it here! The matt-y surface feels so luxurious and doesn't keep much oil/fingerprints (unless they're super greasy). And it just looks like a $50 case or more TBH. I was a little hesitant to spend $20 on it, but I am so glad I found this one. For once, I don't feel like I'm going to have to buy 20 cases for my new current iPhone (12 Pro Max). It's a great feeling to have, because I'm not kidding--it's been an addiction. But I can still tweak the character of the phone a little bit by changing the colors of the buttons. At first, I sported the red buttons, but then I realized I just prefer the black buttons most of the time. Get this case! I promise you'll like it!",

    "text": "I love this case!!! I think the long-winded search for the perfect 6s Plus case is finally complete for me! Before you read on, understand this about me. I am a case nut. My wife makes fun of me because I collect them and swap them out on a weekly, sometimes daily basis. But I change them depending on my mood. I am picky when it comes to cases. And I'd prefer not to have one at all but the phone is so slick and thin and delicate that I'm afraid to not protect it somehow. I'm very careful with my phones. So I like the ultra slim cases. I've had other slim cases like the Totalee and one similar, but that material is just still too slick. No grip. That's why this one is perfect for me. It's like a super slim jacket, yet slightly grippy, adding the perfect amount of grip and elegance to the phone. It covers every part of the phone too. I didn't think I'd like that it covers the ports on the bottom but now that I have it on, I think it looks so slick! Such a great deal on this case. I think I might buy another one in a different color. The material is very flexible, but still stays the on the phone nice and snug. I really think I won't be swapping out cases for some time, maybe never again (until I get the 7). Seriously! Good product guys, and I love the price. This is exactly what I've been looking for.",

The color is just like it shows on the pictures. She loves this teal/mint color and it looks beautiful with the white/gold iPhone. She said it's probably her favorite case she's had and she also loves the look and feel. So, very happy customers here. Nicely done Obliq!",

    "text": "This product is so great! It works like a charm. The rubber prongs that attach to the air vent grip so well. It's easy to setup on any air vent and it doesn't move easily. I have the iPhone 6s Plus and the magnet works great even through the case I use. The little magnet piece is even thinner than I thought it would be (it comes with 2, 1 rectangular and one circle). I use very thin, &#34;barely-there&#34; types of cases and it still works great with these. Highly recommend this product if you're tired of iOtties or similar products where you have to use more effort to connect and disconnect your phone from a mount. This is so simple, and if I want to put it in my wife's car, it's an easy move. I might just get her one too because the price is awesome! I paid $8 for this, and 2 years ago I paid $20 for the iOttie, which has fallen down from my dashboard because of really hot or cold temperatures. If you need a good mount, get this now!",

    "text": "This is exactly the case I've been looking for, for my iPhone 6S Plus. And yes, it fits the 6S Plus just fine. Perfectly snug, covers just enough for my tastes. I'm careful with my phones, and rarely ever drop them. For those who are clumsy with their devices, keep in mind that this case offers very little protection. However, I love the smooth yet grippy feel of the surface. This red wine color I chose looks so sexy on the space gray color. Case is thicker than the camera lens protrusion, so if your phone is flat on the surface, your camera is not touching it. The case is fairly thin, but I love this about it. I've always been a fan of &#34;barely-there&#34; types of cases, I've experimented with Elago and TOTALEE thin cases. This is the best one I've had yet. Highly recommend for those who love thin cases. And a great price! Wow!<br /><br />*Update: I had two cracks in my case that came out of nowhere and showed up only 2 days into use. However, I contacted the customer who promptly responded and kindly provided a promo code so I could place an order for another. That's the kind of customer service that earns 5-star ratings. Thank you!",

The watch & airpod charger are both integrated & completely wireless instead of requiring an Apple charger for the watch. She travels a lot & will need to take the cord with her.<br />After reading another review, I followed up with my mother to make sure she didn't experience any problems with the charger. She hadn't experienced any troubles with the chargers or her devices besides not lining up the phone correctly & waking up to an uncharged phone.<br />I love that it uses USB-C for the input, (I'll keep mentioning that in reviews until I quit buying stuff with Micro USB inputs). As much as I appreciate that everything is wireless charging, it would be nice to have a USB port on the back for other accessories. It is a nice looking product with minimalist design.

So beware that it's not like your phone where you can use it till it's completely empty. The led lights still work at that point though. It's been really hard to completely discharge the device because when it's on its last battery bar, it won't charge my phone. I've been waiting for the device to run out of battery on its own but it's been two days that it still has one bar left.<br /><br />Main problems:<br />1. POTENTIALLY NOT WATERPROOF: Included Instructions say not to get this wet, even though it's marketed as water proof. The rubber orange flap that covers the USB ports is very flimsy in that I'm not convinced its a very tight waterproofed seal when closed. I am comparing this to my Olympus waterproof camera and Pelican waterproof phone case, which both have very tight seals for any ports.<br />2. WEIGHT: this thing is half the thickness of a brick and weighs about the same as a brick. It's not something you'd want to take backpacking or in a purse. It's more of a for-emergency-situations tool. Instructions recommend you utilize it at least every three months.<br />3. DURATION OF RECHARGE: It takes a long time (like overnight) to recharge itself even when plugged into a wall charger.<br />4. EFFICIENCY: It takes at least twice as long to charge my iPhoneX than my other wireless charging pads at home.",

I'm not new to Red Pocket so I knew what to expect; I have 2 annual plans (available through their ebay store) that I use as emergency phones when we travel for my kids. I've always been happy with what you get for the money, and I love that you can pick your network of choice (this one being on Tmobile). I always felt like they were a well kept secret!<br />I'm so happy to see they are now selling these big (large bucket of data) plans here on Amazon for a month of service. I was able to activate the line very easily by going to the website, and popped it into a standard unlocked European gsm phone. I did give it my Galaxy S10 EMEI number first when signing up because I didn't have the phone I intended to use on me yet, but the process was so straight forward, it didn't matter, the sim activated and was ready to go. I never even put the sim card in my Galaxy phone, I put it directly into the European phone once I came home and all the internet and phone calls have been working great!<br />The service is identical to T-mobile coverage where I live, I'm told there might be pockets of places where real T-mobile users can roam on other networks to expand coverage (Tmobile often makes roaming agreements with these carriers, and that wouldn't apply here), but so far it has service everywhere that my regular T-mobile line does. It's definitely on par with other MVNOs such as Mint Mobile, both in coverage and data speed.<br />This makes a great month of service to have as a spare line for someone traveling, visiting from another country, or just to try out a switch and see if you like it to save some money. You are given an option to port your number or get a new one, no further payment is required unless you want it to use it for more than the 30 days included. I'm very happy and would highly recommend it!",

The same port arrangement and order, same specifications, etc. But after being disappointed with another similar charger that suffered quality control issues, I'm happy to say this one is actually really nice.<br />Whereas the other one felt like it was made of cheap plastic and actually fell out of of the wall socket under its own weight, this one feels much more premium and well made. It holds itself well, and all the ports seem to work so far. The old one stopped working after a few uses but so far this one is doing great!<br />The obvious advantages to a charger like this is that it offers both standard USB charging as well as PD charging, so you can top off your laptop, phone, tablet, or any other accessory on the go.",

    "text": "I got a chance to try this handset after playing with their higher end M7, so I was sort of expecting a stripped down version of Android like that one has.<br />No such luck, this is a straight-up feature phone (aka \"dumb phone\"), with no recognizable OS at all. A throwback to a simpler time, when we didn't have touch screens or apps, or even threaded text messaging! (seriously I forgot how difficult it is to carry a conversation when you can't see the previous messages leading up to it!)<br />It has a camera, but it's also reminiscent of the sort of quality you'd find on camera phones back in the pre-smartphone era. In other words, you can sort of tell what's going on in the photo but it's more of a novelty feature than a useful one. The UI is a little bit clunky and not entirely intuitive either, but you can navigate it well enough once you get used to it.<br />Where this phone shines is in its durability and function. This thing is built like a TANK, waterproof, drop proof, has a great rubber grip in your hands, and that speaker is LOUD. I mean, we're talking using it around factory floor welding machines loud. I love the LED circle on the back that lights up when you play audio, that's actually a really cool feature that normal phones don't have which looks fun and also serves the very real function of being able to find your phone when it rings!<br />The problem, however, is trying to determine who this product is for. They say seniors, but I'd argue it is not well suited for that market. The UI is not polished and feels clunky. My teenaged daughter, however, found the light up speaker really fun and actually wanted to try it out for a week, maybe experiment with decluttering her life from social media apps... but we all know that would be short lived.<br />Honestly, the best use I can think of for this device is someone who works in a rough job, like a factory floor or construction site. You don't want the delicate touch screen and two-handed operation that a common smartphone requires, but you want it loud and durable and life-proof. That's a good option, but then it sort of begs the question of why the ring light on the back? It sort of feels mixed up and unsure of what market to be a part of.<br />For what it is, if the features here speak to you and your needs in a phone, it seems a pretty good option so far!",

My kid even used it as a daily driver for over a year back then.<br />It was a good value at the time, not great hardware but you got a lot for your money. Back then, low end handsets were still available with 2GB of ram, so for the money you got a pretty decent display paired with 3GB of RAM and Android 9. It also came with 3 months of prepaid Mint Mobile service in the box, which made it an excellent choice as a starter phone with it's own service- perfect for your kids first handset.<br />Here we are 2.5 years later with an updated handset that has... well, an updated version of the Android OS (Android 11 instead of 9) and not much else. It seems like a similar price point for largely similar hardware. We still have 3 GB RAM and 32 GB storage, and a Mediatek CPU that is mediocre at best. I was hoping it would at least be a faster Mediatek chip but if anything it seems somewhat laggier, although that might just be because the system is still optimizing. Either way, not impressed with the performance so far. That was a good value a couple of years ago but the expectations and demands of mobile devices have changed. The display is bigger, I'll give it that, but it is not a higher resolution.<br />Honestly, it feels like the same handset with similar performance at best, but years later and asking the same money. And this time, it doesn't come with the 3 prepaid months so I can't even say it is as good of a value. Apps demand more resources these days, the newer OS is more optimized for devices with more RAM, and these days even cheap phones can be found with 5G. It just feels like a hard sell now.<br />It's not a BAD device, it get the job done as an unlocked basic phone. But the value feels weak, I was expecting something that felt in 2022 like the X6 did in 2019. Underwhelmed.",

I like that you can see the ring and make sure it is lined up perfectly with your phone- in our use, my daughter's phone has a case with a ring around it to keep magnetic compatibility, and the other charger we tried didn't show you where the ring was. Unlike this one, you had to move it around until it clicked into place. This one is much easier to use and MUCH stronger! You can not only see the ring protrusion, but it practically sucks itself into the phone case if you even get close. You have to practically peel it off when you want to remove it! Nice.<br />The problem however, is that it seems to take a long time to really fully charge. It's great for backup power or to top off your phone if you're out and about, but if you want to bring your phone all the way up to 100% from dead, you probably want a wall powered charger or at least a USB PD battery bank.

The problem, however, is that it is THICK. You can't put it inside a case because it is too thick, it needs to adhere to the back of the case or directly on a phone with no case. The reason it is so thick, we found out, is that the inside is not just a ring of metal but actually tiny little magnetic squares arranged in a circle. That means you need to get the polarity of the charger right to stick on, but it also means  your connection will be stronger than the metal only kind. Make sure you measure and determine where exactly the wireless charging receiver is inside your phone or it won't line up and work properly.<br />If you want the strongest connection and don't care that it is a big visible circle on the back, this definitely works.",

Personally, I wanted a leather band not just for the aesthetics but because I find that sometimes the stock bands irritate my skin when working out. Switching my old watch to a leather band fixed that problem, and I'm hoping this will too, but I'm not sure since the inside might be the same material I started with. That also makes me question if the outside is genuine leather or just a leather-like material to look and feel like it, which is fine for aesthetics honestly.

It is essentially like a cordless landline phone that you can leave the house with, which also supports SMS messages.<br />Calls are clear, volume is good... that is, as long as you have T-mobile service. This phone might as well be locked to that carrier because it won't work with anyone else due to VoLTE restrictions. Verizon *almost* works, I get signal bars and a 4G icon, but since I can't set the APN (there are no APN settings to be found, anywhere) I can't get the LTE to connect, and therefore there is no connection for a voLTE call to be placed. That's OK, the description says it doesn't work with Verizon so that was just wishful thinking, however I have gotten other GSM phones to work and already active VZ sim card, so it SHOULD have been possible, even if unofficially. I put a Red Pocket branded Sim on T-mobile service in for testing, and it worked fine.<br />There are a lot of things I like about it, the size of the buttons, the comfortable feeling in your hand, I love the simplicity and response of it, and the lock button the side means no accidental button presses. BUT, there's a lot I'm disappointed by as well. I own a flip phone from this brand that my son loves (no internet to hog his attention as a communication tool), but at least it has a camera and MMS support. This, surprisingly doesn't even have a camera. It also doesn't support picture messaging (MMS), which surprises me further since that is something that should be expected. Any phone that supports calls and texts should also include MMS as part of the texts layer. If you try to send someone a gif or picture, it just won't show up. No error message, it just doesn't work. Yet the phone has a color screen and can play media like music off an SD card from the menu. This doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />For the price, it's a cute little phone that does handle calls well. If it had a basic camera, MMS support, and maybe even a simple WAP browser, I'd give this 5 stars easily for the ergonomics alone. But as it is now, I'm kind of disappointed. There isn't a target demographic I can think of for this that wouldn't at least want MMS included.<br /><br />NOTE: If buying this for a senior or child and just want a cheap basic plan, I highly recommend Red Pocket's Annual plan. Make sure you get their GSM-T so it works on T-mobile, I was able to get a plan for $30 for the year as an emergency phone, well worth the investment. But I might recommend their flip phone or a different model that supports MMS instead.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:c2219b966be26a8f0df8951bdd80cd4e]] Blu has a reputation of being a decent budget brand and this handset continues that legacy. The first thing you notice is the display- surprisingly bright even in sunlight, and extremely vibrant for the price. Graphics and games are surprisngly fluid and sharp looking, it actually feels reminiscent of Motorola G series handsets. The performance is decent too:<br />Geekbench 5 single core: 342<br />Multi Core: 1200<br />Those test scores aren't current flagship level, but are better than, say, the Pixel 3a series and actually competitive to flagships from not too long ago. Pretty close to a Snapdragon 835 in performance, like a Galaxy S8, yet much more battery friendly.<br />The finger print reader is faster and more responsive than my Galaxy S10, but to be fair the S10 has the worst of the Galaxy fingerprint readers. It even comes with a case and screen protector so you are ready to go right out of the box! But the cameras... that's where the budget nature of this handset starts to show.<br />The camera, despite having a large looking array, really feel low budget. Low light is a non-starter, I won't even bother sharing the noisy garbage that comes out of it. But even in good light, colors are washed out and there's a severe lack of dynamic range that clips highlights and shadows pretty quickly. See photo comparison of a yellow and red box taken next to an open window in my office. The Galaxy S10 and Pixel3A properly captured light from outside the window as well as some detail in the black batteries under the box. It shouldn't be a surprise that those pictures look similar straight out of the camera app, the Pixel and Galaxy S series have some of the best \"standard by which others are judged\" camera performance in the industry. The Blu phone, however, overexposed the window, lost all detail in the battery, and the colors just overall look bad compared to them. I also took a picture trying the \"depth mode\" of a keychain on my wood colored desk, and the bokeh effect is a mess. It doesn't make any sense, blurring out random parts of the wood grain pattern and not looking like real bokeh AT ALL.<br /><br />Basically, this is a decent phone with decent performance and a very nice sized and vivid display for the money! But if cameras are any kind of priority to you, look elsewhere.",

He plays a lot of sports and roughs up the watch and its bands so often, he's literally gone through 3 of them this year already. I tried getting him a metal one so it wouldn't rip/tear, but he said now it just hurts him or anyone he's playing with when they get hit by a sharp metal edge. This product solves all of those problems. They are soft and have elastic properties that help keep it on and won't rip or tear as easily as the rubber silicone ones. Not only that, but it comes in a multi-pack of many colors so he can switch off to match more formal vs sports wear, and plenty to spare if one does eventually break. I doubt these will break anytime soon, however- they seem much tougher than the ones he's used so far!",

Most of the US has good coverage with Verizon, which is the network this uses. If you have a VZ compatible device, you should be good to go for a month of unlimited data on the cheap.<br />Where I live, I use T-mobile / Mint mobile and it is great but when I travel I often find a lot of dead spots, especially in the midwest. On a recent trip to Arizona, I was glad to have a Verizon-compatible spare phone with this service on it to ensure I was in contact and could get map data, etc.<br />However, activating the service with this sim was frustrating.<br />First, the system told me my phone was incompatible (A manufacturer-unlocked Samsung Galaxy S10), which is simply not true. I've used this handset with Verizon prepaid services before and it always works perfectly. Oddly enough, a T-mobile locked Pixel 3 was told I could activate, but it wouldn't accept the sim since it was locked to T-mo. Such a backwards system. I had to find a third device I could borrow (a broken screen Nokia 7.1) which it accepted, just to activate it and put it in the original Galaxy S10 which it said was not compatible.<br />I see from the other reviews here that sometimes activation woes are a thing with this system. I don't know why, I've never had trouble with a VZ-mvno before. I'd give the service 5 stars if the setup were easier to manage. I'm guessing phones like Pixels and iPhones won't have any issues, I'm surprised a Galaxy flagship wasn't on their list.",

There is no play store, and the UI is heavily customized to work with the form factor, but some apps can be sideloaded if you know how Android works.<br />This is NOT a smartphone replacement, but rather a durable work phone for those who want to take some of the conveniences of a smartphone without the smartphone.

Thankfully, this 20mm replacement is a perfect fit!<br />The leather material is much more comfortable on my skin, and attaching it to the watch with the metal pin was actually easier than the oem strap ever was. Buckling it is a little stiffer, but it is still new so I'd give it some time to stretch and act less stiff on my arm. I recently lost some weight and find it comfortable, I think if I had very large wrists I might easily be on the last rung and would find it much less comfortable than I do now. The straps are not very generous if you are large. But for an average sized person, they seem to fit quite well and the dark brown contrast with the black watch face looks super sharp to me, I really like the coloring.<br />All in all, I'm very happy with it so far and would recommend it!",

However, I don't like putting my phone in front of the vents during the winter (blasting hot air on my phone), so I used the suction cup mount of my old holster.

The top and bottom of the case DO have a lip, since they are able to over the device edges. That at least offers some durability and protection if face down.

Disappointed, it barely lasted 3 months.<br />Original review:<br />I got this to use with my wife's Pixel 3a XL, which lacks wireless charging.<br />Happy to say it works, even inside of a wallet case (although I need to pull some of the glue off the back of the wallet case to make it fit- best position seems to be in between the wallet material and the TPU case inside. If placed in the TPU, there are just too many layers and a good connection can't be made reliably). But, I should have opted maybe for a longer cable version. This one places the charging area on the lower third of the phone, which successfully avoids the finger print reader but also makes the phone kind of lopsided on the charger. If placed in the middle of the charging pad, the charging area of this adapter is too off-center to get power. I eventually found a way to make it work for her (I have a long double- space charging pad, and dropping it on there in any orientation seems to make contact), but I needed to fiddle with it before we had a system that works. It is now pretty convenient, and unlike other charging pads I'd try in the past that were cheaper (here and on ebay), this one hasn't burnt out after a few charges. Been using it for months now and so far so good!",

I really like that it has two ports, although I haven't tried running both simultaneously yet (I'd imagine that the power would be divided by the two, slowing the charge of each as opposed to one at a time). The icing on the cake is the volt meter which tells me how much power my car's DC port is currently pumping out. On my 15 year old vehicle, keeping an eye on that is a good idea to determine if the battery is starting to go before I end up stranded somewhere unable to start!

    "text": "Ring lights are an easy way to add some beauty lighting since the shadows are soft and round edged, and the catch light in your eyes has that signature circle shape. I've tried some cheap ones and some expensive ones before, usually the cheap ones didn't give consistent light and were too small, but this seems to be a good mid-range model that is more than adequate. The tripod it comes with is very sketchy, but still decent enough for a desktop. However the phone holder sort of throws off the balance and makes it hard to keep it set up without falling over.<br />I personally was interested in trying this to improve webcam / vblog lighting without my usual 3-point LED light setup. The nice thing about this is that it really is just one light and it gives a very flattering look compared other direct harsh lights or side lights. It's also big enough at 10\" to give a good result for selfies without being too small to cast an even glow or too big that it takes up too much space. The USB port power is fine if using on a desk since there are plenty of USB power ports available by my computer. But if you wanted something more portable, the lack of battery power options and the flimsy tripod which may fall over if used with your phone is definitely something to take into consideration.<br />Otherwise, the results from this are quite nice when used correctly.",

I'm used to checking on it to make sure it is still charging by glancing at the light to make sure it is still on. Honestly, since the light turns off on this charger, I can't tell if it is charging or not without waking the phone and/or removing it again.  I think I might have to go back to my old charger for this device.

As someone who works in video with pro cameras for a living, I can't stress enough how much of a difference it makes to have lights, a proper mic and a stand for the camera... no one wants to see shaking footage with ambient noise louder than your voice!<br />I was a little bit surprised to see it didn't include the LED light in this kit. It clearly shows one on the box, in the instructions, and even on the listing. But upon further inspection, I now see that THIS kit isn't supposed to include the light, there's another version that includes it- the light in the photos here, after all, is just a drawing! That should have given it away, but it wasn't obvious to me from the listing at first. I think they should be more clear about that so that buyers won't expect it.<br />As far as the product itself- it does work quite well to hold your phone and it can be configured in multiple positions and orientations. The microphones worked alright, I particularly like the lavaliere one, since I found the shotgun style one less clear. The shotgun one did, however, have less echo than the phone's built in mic, so I wouldn't totally discount it. It's good to have. However, you'll need a phone with a 3.5mm TRRS input to use this. I happen to have an LG G7 and a V20 that both offer this jack, but many modern phones have removed it. You may need a dongle or other adapter to be able to use these mics at all. These are things that I really feel aren't made clear before you buy the product, and I think should be. That makes it not a bad product, but one that might let buyers down if they have unrealistic expectations of what they are getting. I hope this review helps people avoid only finding that out when they receive it.",

Not too fast and not too slow either.<br />What I'm not a big fan of, however, is the automatic motorized arms. I mean, at first it seems really cool- they make a satisfying whirrrr noise and grab your phone upon placing it in the Qi zone, and it impresses passengers too because it seems like something a luxury car would do. Pressing the button to release the phone is equally impressive- the first few times. After a while, it gets old and then you sort of wish it had a manual override because it takes too long. Sometimes I'm running into the house for a minute and want to grab the phone while the car is running, and it took me a couple of attempts to get the arms to release and then I'm waiting awkwardly with my hand out for the 2 seconds or so it takes for the arms to finish moving. Two seconds might not sound like a lot, but in that moment it feels like an eternity, and you sort of just wish it had a spring release like the old style phone holders.<br />Also, interesting to note that the motors require power to move. In order to avoid your phone being stuck inside once you turn off the engine, it holds enough internal charge (via capacitor) to release the phone after the power is off, and even enough to grab it a second time, but then it's dead until the car turns the power back on. This normally isn't an issue, except that my kids thought the motorized arms are so cool, so they played with it while the car was off, and then I had to go inside and get my keys to release their phone after they hit the buttons twice without the car on.<br />Also, I occasionally unplug the charger if going on short drives because too many stop/start cycles of charging is supposed to be bad for your phone as well. But then if I don't plug it back in, I can't remove the phone. Again.<br />Kind of silly. Again, its cool and looks impressive (especially at first), and it technically does what it is supposed to do- hold your phone well while driving, and charge it at the same time. So it should get at least 4 stars for fulfilling its duty. However a manual override would be really handy.",

Thankfully, this charging pad seems to really keep the phone relatively cool, definitely more than other Qi chargers, and it is very small and unobtrusive yet doesn't charge too slowly either. If you're going to leave your phone on the charging pad for hours at a time, I definitely recommend this one. I also like the bright LED that tells me the phone is connected and stays on so at a glance I can see if my phone isn't making good contact anymore or anything like that. I had another Qi charger that initially lit up to say it connected, but then the LED would turn off leaving me to find out hours later that it actually disconnected because it was at a bad angle at only 50%.

It's a great value for the money, but it will never compete with, and should never be compared to, anything remotely flagship. It's a passable Android device, a worthy backup and an excellent first phone for someone.<br />If you remember the Amazon exclusive Blu R1, it's that caliber of device- surprisingly useful for not a lot of money. But upgraded, as we now have 3GB of RAM and 32 GB storage standard. In this day of $1000 smartphones, its great to see some entry-level products that aren't terrible. What makes this even more incredible, however, is the included 3 months of service. There's an included SIM card for Mint Mobile, a T-mobile MVNO, which you can activate in the phone and use for the next 3 months for FREE. Assuming T-mobile has coverage where you live (they've gotten a LOT better lately!), and 5GB LTE is enough per month for your needs, you now have the next 3 months covered. I'm personally paying $20 a month for my plan, so that means this handset could save me $60 of service.  That makes this already decent value handset into an incredibly good value!<br />For more details about the phone and performance, camera, benchmarks, etc, I decided to include a video rather than many paragraphs of text.

I have plenty of dual-ear headphones, both over the ear style and Air-pod style, but they all have microphones up by my ears and away from my mouth. That setup works alright but in noisier environments (working around tools, washing dishes, etc) callers almost always tell me they hear too much background noise and it is hard to hear me over it.<br />But NOT WITH THIS ONE! This headset is designed for functionality over style, and gives a very good mic up close to your mouth, you know, where words actually come out! Callers were able to hear me in places I normally wouldn't bother trying to hold a conversation, and the ear piece meanwhile is fantastic! No more trying to pop ear buds back in with my fingers when they are dirty or wet, the over-the-head band design makes it comfortable to wear and keeps it in place, and while the single-ear sound isn't ideal for music, it is GREAT for audiobooks and lectures. When I'm not on the phone, I like to listen to lectures and books while busy and working with my hands. Usually this means that I have to stop and take off half my dual-ear earphones if someone needs my attention (happens often), which is annoying not to mention I often can't hear someone calling my name when I have the noise cancellation style one. For a while I was actually listening to something with over-the-ear style headphones and one side OFF my ear so that I could hear and answer people at the same time as listen to the author. This, obviously, takes care of all those issues while also being the best phone call experience I've had on a bluetooth headset.<br />The charging base is cool too, it holds the headset up and ready to go but I sort of wish that it would turn on automatically when you remove it from the base, and then turn off when you put it back on. That way it would waiting and ready and require a single motion to use it (take it off the base and put it on). Right now I have to remember to turn it off when I'm done like any other headset or else it will continue getting my calls and phone audio when waiting on the base as long as I'm in range. And when I put it on, obviously I need to manually press the power button again as well. Feels like this would be a simple thing for them to fix, but alas, I find this set so great otherwise that I'll let that slide.",

    "text": "Two very important and often overlooked things that are great about this: Landscape, and Wallet-case compatibility. Let me start with the former: Ever notice that car info systems like GPS screens are ALWAYS widescreen / landscape orientation? That's most likely for the same reason TV and computer screens are... your eyes are side-to-side, not up and down. So the most efficient layout of information to be seen at-a-glance is side to side. Yet, most car phone holders are designed to hold your phone in that awkward looking up-and-down vertical portrait orientation. It not only looks silly to me, it also never fits the aesthetics of your dashboard and seems out of place.<br />This is one of the ONLY phone holders that actually makes your phone look like it is part of the dashboard display. It's not oddly sticking out of your window or blocking a vent or anything like this. In fact, if you stick this mount in the center of your console, it looks like your phone is just an additional screen above your other components, like it BELONGS there, like a factory installed option.<br />Using it for GPS and streaming radio looks like I have one of those fancy Android Auto head units built in (even though my car predates that tech!), the only tell being when I decide to also charge it via cable on the side.<br />But the other great thing about this, is that my wife can use her wallet case on her phone and still mount it in this holder. That's something we've been struggling with doing on almost every other phone holster out there.  We love this so much on our minivan that I decided to replace my magnetic phone mount on my commuter car as well. I highly recommend this style holder to anyone who wants their phone display to be cleanly visible and efficient while not an eye sore.",

    "text": "Let's face it- the V20 is not a small phone. For my wife, once you are carrying around something this big, it might as well also be a wallet/clutch. This case is great in that it holds a credit card and license and her phone conveniently so all her bases are covered.  The stylus pen is a nice add on, but not really so practical- we don't carry it around or use it. On a screen this big, you don't really need a stylus to pinpoint fine details on the display with your touch. It is nice that they throw it in, but the case is obviously what you buy this for.<br />Something to note: LG phones DO support magnetic auto-sleep and wake functions. But, very few cases are made to work with that. More specifically, some cases have a magnet in the fold on front that the phone can detect and automatically put it to sleep when closed. It will then auto wake when you open the flap (you can actually try this waving a fridge magnet over your screen if you want to see). This case does NOT do that, as none of the inexpensive cases seem to.<br />However, with the V20, you have the \"second screen\" which WILL sleep upon the proximity sensor detecting the flap is closed, and wake up when it sees the light again. So that's a nice touch, but all cases will do that. Meanwhile, you still need to manually wake the phone in this case by either double-tapping or pressing the power button / FP reader. This is something I was trying to find out about before hand but no one was mentioning, so hopefully this information helps the next person!",

Her phone fits nicely sideways so the idea behind this seems to make sense for users like her, but the angle is just barely too acute to fit the wallet part flipped behind the phone. Its a shame, as it almost works, but the case can still sort of drop the phone during a turn, which is unfortunate. On my phone it worked fine since I just use a standard TPU shell to protect my phone, but I don't need this for my car. I wanted it for my wife's wallet case. It didn't do what we wanted, but the seller was very pleasant to deal with and understanding- they did try to figure out a way to solve our problem, but ultimately it didn't work for us.

    "text": "This case is excellent at what it needs to be- namely, protect the phone, look nice, all while also conveniently being a mini-wallet. The buttons are still easy to use (plastic is not too stiff, unlike other wallet phone cases I've used), and the cutouts for the camera and speaker keep it from getting in the way of normal operation.<br />The only issue I've had, is the clearance for the headphone jack on the bottom. When we tried to use the AUX input in our car, my wife couldn't get the plug to go in completely because a bit of the plastic shielding around the phone got in the way. After pulling away at it with a fingernail, I managed to get enough clearance for the plug to go the rest of the way in and work properly, but it seems we have to do this every now when using the jack. I thought about using a pocket knife to make the hole bigger in case it happens again, but I'm afraid of going too far and ripping the plastic, which would then cause the phone not to stay in place any longer.<br />Thankfully, my wife doesn't use wired headphones very often so this hasn't gotten in the way of her thoroughly enjoying the case otherwise. I just think it could have been made better to avoid that problem.<br /><br />Another thing that would have been nice (but not expected), is a magnet for auto-wake. The X Power actually has an auto-sleep/wake feature which uses a magnet on their official flip cover! I had read about this &#34;window view&#34; mode which gets enabled with their official LG cases, where there is a stripe of visible vertical screen that shows alerts, time, etc, when the cover is closed (and it eventually times out to sleep). When the cover opens, it wakes up the phone.<br />I tested this with a refrigerator magnet, and sure enough it works! I tried sticking a thin magnet into the wallet section of the case to emulate this functionality, but it wasn't strong enough. I might try using some adhesive with a stronger magnet in the future. Would be super cool if the third party cases had this magnet!",

And I actually kind of dig the clear look on it, as the Moto is a nice looking phone IMO.<br />The only issue is that my wife, who I bought this for, actually likes the bigger and tougher case because she drops her phone alot and feels more confident with the hard case than this one.

    "text": "So first of all, I originally had pictures to go with this, but Amazon's review system has been having trouble approving reviews with pictures lately. I'm re-writing this review without pictures this time in order to make sure it doesn't get stuck in limbo again. So y'all will have to use your imagination a little more!<br /><br />This is a pretty great case for a Galaxy S4. As you can see in the product description and photos, it has two parts: a smaller half-shell case for the actual phone, and a larger belt holster that it securely slides into. When the phone is inserted into the holster, it is fairly well protected on all sides. The holster is actually REVERSIBLE as well, which means you can insert your phone facing outwards or inwards. What is interesting about this setup, is that you can actually use the rotating belt clip part as a kickstand using this nifty metal clip in the middle of it to hold it up (wish I could show the picture for this). But to be perfectly honest, there's very little reason I can think of to do this since the smaller inner case has its own kickstand already, and using it facing outward in the holster doesn't actually offer any additional protection. It just does the same think but bulkier!<br /><br />Speaking of which, one that I didn't like about this case is that without the whole thing slid into the holster, there really is only protection on the back and part of the sides of your phone. A lot of the edges are open and unprotected, especailly the top and bottom edges, which is unfortunately the part that is prone to knicks/dents if it falls. That being said, the small inner case might not offer as much protection as a silicone wrap style one, but it does at least make the phone less slippery to hold in your hand since it is a rubberized plastic shell. I actually like that, since you not only get to have a kickstand, you also get the non-slip and scratch deterrent of rubber/silicone, while also have the dent protection of hard plastic. Oh yeah, and the kickstand works in both portrait and landscape orientations.<br /><br />Things I didn't like:<br />-I've already mentioned that without the holster, it feels like the front and edges of my phone aren't really protected. If you want something like an Otter Box, look elsewhere (this is way thinner though).<br />-The inner case is a bit difficult to remove quickly for battery swaps. I actually have 3 spare batteries I like to keep on tap so I never have to charge, and I always feel like I have to bend the shell to almost the point it might break to get the phone out. I'm not sure if it is designed to withstand doing that on a regular basis.<br />-When using the phone in the holster, it effectively blocks access to the USB port for charging. You can't keep the holster on it while charging.<br /><br />That's the worst I can think of. Everything else is pretty great about it. I love the kickstand and the rubberized hard plastic. To be fair, I did receive this at a discount in return for my review. I do my best to be completely honest about the things I review, and for the retail price, I think it deserves 4 stars.",

I expected this stand to have a good grip as it should so that your phone doesn't get dropped because the adhesive came unstuck, well I'm here to tell you that you absolutely do not have to worry about the adhesive going anywhere! The description should inform us customers that this adhesive is permanent and cannot be safely or easily removed as most other adhesives can. The description is misleading to say the least.",

It adjusts easily to fit your phone. The neck is fully adjustable too. The only thing that could make this better is if the bottom was cut a little wider... With a cell phone case on my S21, it doesn't lock into the bottom as the flap that lifts to charge prevents it from fitting snug. It works okay without a case, however I always like to keep the case on my phone for extra protection. The only other thing that could be better is if this was also a wireless charger.",

It's basically a portable tripod with a ring light that holds both your camera and phone.<br /><br />There were no instructions in the box, however if you have common sense, it's easy to put together. It gets it's power from USB, so you will either need a portable power bank or just plug into USB outlet. The attached USB cord is quite lengthy, which is good.<br /><br />The phone holder only seems to work for smaller phones. It works for my Samsung Galaxy, but it doesn't fit my wife's IPhone XR. It seems to hold my phone better without the case... it fits, but fell off a few times with the case on. The camera holder is nice. I just wish the arms were a bit more sturdy as if you have a heavier phone or camera, the arms sink down as they can't bear the weight. This actually happened with both my Samsung phone and camera... üò©<br /><br />I like the flexibility of this product as you can position however you want, and the light has different settings. The flexibility also allows for easy storage.<br /><br />I think it would be better if the bottom had a stand, versus a clamp. The clamp is difficult to open and if the surface is too thick or thin, it won't stay. This doesn't leave me with many areas to clamp it on... It did clamp onto my entertainment center, but didn't work with my countertops or kitchen table as they were both too thick to fit on the clamp.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this product, it's a cool concept, just needs it's flaws fixed and it would be great!",

With that said it's quite bulky and adds considerable heft to my iPhone, although since it's such a slim phone to begin with it really doesn't bother me overall.<br /><br />As for the build quality, I had my first drop in the house after having the case for a day.  The two halves attach together in 3 places, on the sides and at the top.  The top clip is very small piece of plastic, maybe 2mm wide, although there is room for a much wider clip.  This immediately shattered when I dropped the phone, and the case exploded, leaving my iPhone and the two halves of the case on the ground.  I'm worried what will happen if I drop it on a more dangerous surface outside.  Now the case doesn't fit as securely because it's only attached on the sides, and I can't see how in testing they couldn't determine that piece would snap off really easily.  I think the attachment between the two halves should be a lot more secure so it just doesn't come apart when dropped ... I mean, isn't the point that it protects the phone when it's dropped?<br /><br />Good effort speck, but if I didn't love the way this looked so much I'd have a new case on there already.",

    "text": "I've had this installed in my car for about 2 months now and overall am very pleased with it.  I wanted a bluetooth kit that would not only let me make calls but also let me play music from my phone without having to plug it in and this accomplishes that quite well.  Overall I'd say it's a great product with a few flaws that annoy me on an almost daily basis, but that I've pretty much gotten over (though I can't make sense of some of these design decisions - hasn't Parrot been making these for a while?)<br /><br />1. The screensaver - there's a screensaver that comes on for seemingly no reason other than to distract you while you're trying to look at the road. It's just a bouncing bluetooth logo that you have to press a button on the remote to get rid of, usually resulting in the system performing some unintended action when all you wanted to do was make the screensaver go away so you could see your signal strength and/or battery life.<br /><br />2. Audio muting - it seems a little aggressive on the audio muting.  For some reason it seems to insist upon muting your system for about 3 seconds when it connects to your phone and also any time you get a text message, even though...<br /><br />3. No text display - it doesn't display texts on the screen.  You just have to infer that you got one by the fact that it muted the audio for a few seconds and then pick up your phone and check it.  Lame.  I swear other bluetooth kits can do this...<br /><br />4. No track info display - this one is certainly more annnoying that I thought.  Again, you have to pick up your phone to see what track is playing (although thankfully you can control playback from the remote).<br /><br />5. Doesn't work well with polarized sunglasses - (starting to dig here) If you've seen a display that gets all screwy when you're wearing polarized sunglasses, then you know what I mean.  I'm just mentioning this because a lot of people wear them while driving and Parrot designs a lot of car kits, so you think they would have designed with this in mind.  Or not...<br /><br />6. The remote - while I haven't had any of the breakage or short battery life issues that other people have, I am surprised at how poor the remote mounting \"system\" is - and by system I mean a cheap plastic band that is way too huge for just about any steering wheel.  I mounted mine on the thickest part of my wheel and had to use the tightest setting on the mounting band.  I know Sony has been making wheel-mounted remotes for its car stereos for years that have much better attachment systems than this.  Come on Parrot!<br /><br />Overall, I'd say if you're considering, it's either this or the Bluetouch at like 2-3x the price.  Overall a great system, so much so that I've been considering getting an iPhone if and only if they add stereo bluetooth because I'd miss being able to use my MK6100 too much if I switched.",

I think it comes down to how you naturally hold your phone while using it.  I gave small hands, and what I have since realized is that I don't hang onto my phone with my fingers or an actual grip. Rather i hang onto the popsocket between my two fingers, my grip is \"open\" the phone rests on my fingers, leaving my thumb free to move anywhere.  With this ring, I've been forced to go back to gripping the actual phone and now my mobility is limited.  I'm also finding I have to use two hands far more often with a ring grip (to type and surf.... as well as to open, close and spin the ring). I'm constantly having to adjust the ring to fit my grip, since I rotate my phone screen a lot.<br />I also don't get or understand the generic clear adhesive circle disk that you have to put down before attaching the 3m adhesive. It's huge under the ring, it's ugly, and is already starting to bubble up on the edges. And technically, the 3m adhesive isn't touching the case at all. Pretty sure the 3m was included simply as a selling point.<br />Don't get me wrong, pop sockets aren't perfect. Of the three I've had, the design rubbed off on all three and one popsocket broke off.  But never had a problem with the actual adhesive despite common complaints with them.  And I find it easier to use, since I don't have to consciously think about what position the ring is turned too.<br />The other thing I noticed is the metal ring is hard... The popsocket is more of a tough rubber. I kind of smirked at other reviews that complained about the hard metal not being a comfortable feeling.... But they were surprising correct.  Our fingers are very sensitive and the hard metal ring is uncomfortable in comparison.<br />The only aspect of the ring I like over the popsocket is when I'm actually NOT using the phone.  Carrying a ring looped onto one finger is more secure than a pop socket squeezed between two fingers.  I'm switching back to a pop.",
