I was able to cut-out the plastic between the Lightning cable opening and the speaker openings in the bottom of the bumper case to remedy the problem, but it does take a bit of care.  The second issue relates to quality of construction; the soft, rubbery material on the top of the bumper came loose after removing the phone from it 4-5 times (in order to plug in the 30-pin adapter in my vehicle).<br /><br />That said, I really do like this style of protector.  It gives direct access to the screen and doesn't trap moisture between the back phone cover and the protector like the clear Incase product does.  I'm going to look for another product like this one that will also allow use of the 30-pin adapter and is a little more sturdy.

This wouldn't really be a problem except the back plate that touches the phone slides onto the mount and with the friction of the arms touching the phone, when I lift the phone off the whole back plate slides of with it making it a two hand operation to remove my phone.

They will take care of you.<br /><br />  BUYER BEWARE - This is not simply a NEW unlocked LG phone...this is an unlocked AT&T LG phone!  The AT&T logo is right on the case and you will find out it is AT&T through and through as you navigate pages. I am going to discuss with Amazon if the description isn't fully truthful. New?  Not so sure.  Box taped up before then tape ripped off.  No user's manual.  Sticker slapped over technical info pre-printed on box.<br />  Now on to the phone - switched from Verizon to Consumer Cellular.  I was told by seller and CC that I might lose higher functions.  Functions I lost were internet access and mobile email.  I can live without.  .  Still would have liked seeing factory fresh packaging when NEW.  Take note of what I did not.  I was used to a 5 line keypad and did not realize.  This is a 4 line phone.  I did not pay close enough attention. This has no dedicated number line.  Numbers on this phone are an &#34;ALT +&#34; function.  I miss the number line.  Numbers are in a dark blue field on the shared keys.  Impossible to see in lower light.  Keypad backlighting fades out quickly.  Have not yet found a setting to fix this.  Also, you had better be a fast dialer...lack of input of more than a few seconds will black out the display. Yes, I know...only $50.  But it is $50 I would like to have back to buy a better phone.  Threw away all the packaging so return is not an option.<br />  Porting my number from Verizon to CC no problem.  My generous Consumer Cellular Plan is $17.50/mo. with no contract.  They simply did not offer a keypad phone in their lineup.  If you can live without the features I mentioned by going to anyone but AT&T, go for it. If I could get I would give the phone itself a &#34;C-&#34; grade. Thanks, Todd",

One thing, do not cut open the wipe packs, the wipe is close to the edge and you will cut it as well.  I cut along one of the perforations, slightly opened the park then cut it.

Found out soon enough that the cables provided with the new iPad Pro did not worked with my hub connected to my iMac. As a matter of fact the cable also did not work with iPhone 11 Pro Max, different cables, unlike older versions where one cable did work with either. In order to be able synch the iPad Pro I needed an adapter to connect the newer cable to the older USB, and this USB Female to USB Male Adapter 2 Pack, Type C to A Charger Cable (what a long winded title) worked with zero problems. Willing to bet it would also work with the iPhone mentioned above. Very happy with the purchase, as I am not very savvy overall, but thanks to a fellow reviewer that mentioned a similar case, I got it. Looks and feels sturdy, simple and functional. Was able to connect to iMac flawlessly. 5 Stars.",

It is a sleek case that actually looks very nice, and once the IPhone 6 Plus and the case is closed again, one can tell right away how well designed it is. The easy way it turns into a stand is also very ingenious and helpful, for there are times that hands free viewing is needed. The lining inside prevents any scratches to the IPhone 6 Plus, and the magnetic closure works like a charm.<br />I actually feel that the IPhone while in this sleek enclosure if perfectly safe from harm, and for some this may be a very good option if they want to maintain their phone in its pristine form, without the added bulk of some protective cases that are being offered as we speak. My phone having recently arrived fit perfectly in this fine case. The card slot is also a welcome sight, for it is bound to come in handy while being in such good company. I prefer to have my phone in this case as an added peace of mind, specially at home where it can stand with the help of the case. Belkin has a sure winner with this product, and I am very happy and thankful to Amazon, for delivering this sleek case right to my doorsteps.<br />The IPhone 6 Plus with only a film protector to safeguard the screen, is such a beautiful piece of engineering that with the help of this type of case, one can enjoy its design with no problems. 4.5 Stars!",

    "text": "One thing I have to admit, right here and now: the amazon reviewers are like friends to me. Friends I probably never will see, but nevertheless they have so many times helped me out, that I have a strong respect for what they stand for. So In the same context that reviewers have shared their opinions, suggestions (like a much better bargain somewhere else that should be noted), and good knowledge of so many products, I like to send a \"Heads Up\" or \"Red Alert\" on this particular product.<br />Yes, these are small size flashlights but they look good. I was about to purchase this deal here at amazon, but I had heard from fellow reviewers that Costco might be selling them for less, which I knew from past experience was very possible. Woke up this morning, feeling like crap due to an all areas cold, but since I am now heavy into flashlights and lumens, I did call the store near me in SJC, CA, and fellow reviewers were correct. They have this deal, but to my surprise, with a significant difference. Instead of 200 Lumens, these babies rate at 250 Lumens. Together with the fact that they are dispensed with batteries and the price so much nicer (I am not trying to offend amazon's sensibilities-if it's possible such a giant can blink an eye due to emotions), but the end result was alarmingly delightful.  Great deal for a high rated item, plus the confidence of buying from a place like that one where all returns are accepted if needed, I thought I immediately write a review and mention this.<br />Here they are telling me that I have went a little overboard for flashlights. After years of using a very mediocre (30 Lumens at most) flashlights, they simply stopped working. While looking for replacement I bought the following: MagLite with D batteries (131 Lumens),  A pair of Life Gear (they came in two's 400 Lumens), Coast HP17? (605 Lumens very very cool), a much smaller Coast, baby of the family kind of like these Techlite's (131 Lumens), Life Gear again on sale (1000 Lumens), and now, for now, these other babies with a surprising 250 Lumens.<br />Yes, I been known to go compulsive when something grabs me the correct way. Now I keep eyeing, kind of see but do not own for now, at the real bad asses out there like Olight Flashlight (a particular one that sells way above $300 and has 2200 Lumens), called the Intimidator. I must be bored out of my mind but I can not get this one out of my mind, but thanks to my wallet who as of late is screaming for common sense, I have yet to pull the trigger! Who would have thought flashlights were so cool and I only started on October of 2012, What about Surefire, Fenix, etc? Come On! Give me a break, at least till the Holidays are through. Unless I buy everyone a flashlight and take possession once the novelty wears out. Can not do it.<br />Techlite Lumen Master 200 Lumens High-Intensity CREE XPG L.E.D. Tactical Flashlight, 3 Pack, great lights 4.5 Stars.<br />PS: there is another Techlite with 500 Lumens on sale at the place I mentioned above where I purchased mine (don't want to say the mane twice but this one ends with .com), until January 3? $49.99 included shipping and handling. I am almost sure I am not going to last and it will become a must have item, while everyone around me keep asking themselves: what in the world is really going with this fool and all these flashlights? Enticing for sure!",

This phone worked great just long enough to get most of the stuff off the POS iPhone. Took it off the charger at 6am...100%. used 10-15 minutes stuck in pocket and drove for an hour. Checked it another 90 minutes later about 9am ....49%. excuse me.... This makes iPhone crappy battery life look super! Charge time: ALL NIGHT. THERE IS NO 15 MINUTE QUICK CHARGE FOR 6 HOURS OF LIFE.<br /><br />THIS IS CLEARKT A DUD! AND IT SUCKS BECAUSE I LEAVE FIR CANADA And ALaska for 6 weeks in less than 2 weeks.<br /><br />Buy with caution! Put this thru the paces hard during return period. Let the battery discharge and recharge. Run movies, songs, games. I've had this less than a week and noticed over memorial day weekend battery progressively getting worse...AND FAST!",

After I got it all set up, I was able to mess around on Facebook, play one game, and text a few people. Then, it froze. OK no problem, reboot the phone. It started this endless circle of shutting down and starting back up for about 30 minutes. Finally get back in to where I could do something, or so I thought. Tried to send a text...frozen, again. Reboot the phone again and start the endless circle of the reboot process. Start a factory reset after finally getting back in.  set the phone back up and get to the home screen of saying who I am and linking my Google account. Guess what happened. You guessed it, frozen. Another viscous reboot cycle and factory reset yada yada yada, frozen. It was by about the 3rd factory reset and still frozen that the return was started not even having the phone for 24 hours.",

The case is a thick material and will last me for the life of my phone. I like how it's so smooth in my hand, I catch myself running my phone,  which is silly I know. It's a flexiable case, so it's easy to get on and off as well. I got this product at a discount for my honest review.",

I'm sure I'll get used  to it and probably not even notice it after a while, but its disappointing to put a brand new screen protector on a brand new phone and not have it adhere perfectly.<br />Kudos to the company though on supplying not only 3 screen protectors in this kit, but also the mounting guide/frame so that the screen protector aligns correctly with the phone's screen, as well as 3 sets of wet wipes, drying wipes, dust magnets, etc.  It's a very well thought-out package at a very reasonable price.",

Half the protector is up now(it folded up and rubbed on my shirt and collected lint as well!). I do have the second one to use but if I have the same results I will have spent the $8 for less than a week of usage!!! I honestly believe that the reason this product has such high ratings is because it gave out promo codes for free/discounted products in order to boost positive reviews. Look for a better option or be sadly disappointed!<br /><br />Update- my husband put the second screen protector on after I went to bed last night. Woke up and again it looked perfect. It has now been 8 hours and the entire thing just fell off!!!! I have done nothing today except cook breakfast and wash a couple of load of laundry. This is beyond ridiculous!

It came surprisingly good, although no installation instructions, but relatively straightforward as my pictures showed. All components are metal, very sturdy but not overly heavy. It's better to have the factory 7 mm radio bracket to hold it securely. However I don't have it as my aftermarket head unit is not compatible with the bracket, so I have to use some gorilla tape to secure it. The phone mount holds up to 3/4” thick phone no problem. Mine is iPhone 13 with OtterBox. You can also hang the hand held radio and even a CB on the side bracket. I'm using midland 275. Make sure to tighten down all the bolts after installation",

Most importantly, it comes with two supporting points, one being the main suction cup and the other being the small clip support. In this way, the phone can be firmly supported and less likely fall off because the suction fails as the force is distributed between the two supporting points.",

You do have to give it a couple of days to totally unbubble, but it is far superior to the stiff screen protectors that ALWAYS end up with a piece of lint under them no matter how hard I try.  Mine came with a spray to prepare the screen protector as well as my fingers to eliminate fingerprints and a substantial squeegie to help push out bubbles.  I am 100% happy with it and I love the 'rubberish' texture of it.  I highly recommend this screen protector!",

    "text": "There is a very limit selection of cell phone covers for the G8 ThinQ.  I purchased 3 different ones (spigen tough armor, vinve carbon fiber and this ghostek one), because we have multiple G8 phones.  5 stars for sturdiness, 5 stars for durability, 5 stars for not being slippery.  This cover is well made and probably the sturdiest of the 3 we purchased, and not slippery.  It will protect the phone if it drops on the sides or back.  It is thicker than I expected, yet wished that it protected the glass screen a little better.  LG screens are very sensitive, so if you buy this case, I would recommend purchasing a glass screen protector.  So 4 stars for protecting the screen.  I think the spigen case will protect the screen better.  4.5 stars for ease of finding side buttons, and the ability of pushing the buttons.  The spigen case buttons are not as good (flushed to the phone).  Wished that the corner bumper guards were not red, I think it looks odd, and would look nicer if it was the same color as the case.  Wished that it wasnt so bulky looking, as it is much bigger than my other case and makes the phone look larger than it is.  Overall, it is a good phone case, and I would recommend if you are looking for a sturdy, durable case, and dont mind the bulk and red corners.",

As noted by other reviewers, such hard glass screens do not wrap around the curved edges of the new iPhone 6/6 Plus. The Tech Armor protector leaves at least 1/8 of an inch of the iPhone screen exposed around the entire perimeter. Some cases may cover over this exposed section; my Spigen case unfortunately does not.",

    "text": "I have been playing around with VR for a long time now, right from Oculus rift to Google Cardboard. It is valuable to understand that if you're looking at this product, you're probably looking for something similar to Google Cardboard which is not an actual cardboard and not something like Oculus or Hololens. This is a good product for beginners that want to start playing around with VR apps on their phones and a great products that want to watch movies and videos on it. That being said, I don't think this is the best product over all.<br />Before I get into Pros and Cons, let's begin with the shipping and packaging. The product arrived seamlessly, on time. The packaging was good, meaning it was not damaged, the content packaged as promised by the seller were present and worked fine. I have used it for over a week now and the following is what I think about the True Depth VR Viewer for Smartphones.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Good fit. Adjustable straps.<br />- Adjustable holder for smartphones which allows iPhone 5 and iPhone 6. For Android, any phone comparable to the iPhone in size.<br />- Adjustable viewer width for people of all head sizes (meaning thinner or wider space between eyes).<br />- Padding makes it comfortable for the face.<br />- Camera can be used by taking the back cover off for Augmented Reality apps.<br />- Earphones can be used while using this<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Can't focus. Although the lenses can be rotated and that is suppose to adjust the focus, it didn't work for me.<br />- Nose space is not padded and can get uncomfortable for some.<br />- No QR code and hence no Google Cardboard apps can be used.<br />- Not immersive, which makes it good for movies and videos but not for many gaming apps.<br /><br />Over all, I would repeat, its great from watching movies and videos but not the best for playing games. The attached photos would give a good idea of how it looks.<br />Although I was given this product for free, my review is absolutely honest and unbiased.",

    "text": "See update below review:<br /><br />Looks can be deceiving. The ANKER USB-C 25W PD Fast Wall Charger looks well designed and sturdy, but the smallest error in calculations or the manufacturing process going awry can destroy the best of intentions.<br /><br />It was about a month after receiving the charger that I started to have issues with it working. I started to send it back then (about 6 weeks ago) , however my past experience with Anker products being reliable, at a lower price point than top of the line of electrical/electronic products and not wanting to go through the return process had me hesitate. Now it is acting up again on a more regular basis.<br /><br />The problem is that the folding of the outlet prongs don't stay set internally and the prongs fold just enough to lose contact inside the unit and then it stops charging. I have jiggled and fiddled with putting up with it for too long now. I don't feel that sending back an electrical product after using it this long is proper.<br /><br />However, I did see that even though the return window had closed, there was product support for 90 days and it was within this parameter. So I chatted with an Amazon support bot and finally had to request a call back. The Amazon live agent did a good will return on this. Not sure I should have used a 'good will' credit for such a low priced item, but I did.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend this charger. In the future I think I will try not to get a charger with folding prongs for travel. I have plenty of these that still work and the chance of them not being made correctly and thus not working is multipled over a simple normal stationary prong.<br />*** UPDATE JAN 13 2023 ***<br />Anker saw the review that I did on this charger and the problem with the folding prongs that were defective and not allowing electricity to flow through to the charger. They reached out to me and asked if I would like a refund or replacement. This was done quite a while past any normal return period. They say that they guarantee most of their products for 18 months (I think I have this correct) but I was surprised to get such a message for an electronic product. I accepted the full refund as I had already purchased another charger without folding prongs. Kudos to Anker for such a responsible, caring attitude!!",

Also I liked the desk stand prop that is separate from the belt clip apparatus.<br /><br />Some faults are that the rubber access port covers don't always close tightly, so don;t trust for keeping out water.

Most of the case is a matte black which does not attract too many fingerprints, one thing I really like is the bezel imitates the bezel of the 5/5S both in terms of shape and a slight glossy finish.  There are also 4 small bumps on the 4 corners on the rear of the case that raise the phone just enough off the surface to minimize scratching the clear plastic back. I like that.<br /><br />What I'm not crazy about is where you can see where the parts of the case were molded together -- the four corners.  Also the clear plastic back tends to attract quite a bit of fingerprints, but so does your screen.  Not a big issue, at least for me.",

This covers my phone 100%. The charging area is easy to get to and buttons on the side of the phone work good. Takes great pictures with the case on.<br /><br />I can't tell you if it's water proof or not because I will NEVER attempt to try it. Even though iPhone 11 can get wet up to a half hour. I won't risk ruining my new $800 phone. Even with a life proof I won't test it. Anyways if my spending that much on a phone, I want it to be completely protected. My cases always stay on my phone except to clean it after a case has been on it for awhile and the case itself needs to be cleaned or if I'm switching cases. Never have I broken any of my iPhones.<br /><br />I did buy the purple iPhone and was hoping to buy a matching case however this seller didn't offer it so I bought the baby blue. Maybe they'll eventually get more in stock. Bug not a big deal.<br /><br />I've only had this for a few weeks but good so far. If my opinion changes then I'll find back to edit my review.",

However having an iPhone is an expensive investment so you want to make sure it's protected. I've never semerged my phone in water or brought it into the pool or ocean to take pictures.

It looks and feels sturdy and it should Protect your phone. However I just got it today and I don't like a few things so I can't say how long it will hold up for. I don't have any issues texting like some other reviewers had, it fits fine, and is completely covered, just like it should be. When making phone calls, people can hear me just fine and I can hear my music fine too. What I don't like is the fact that my chargers won't fit thru the case. And the design is a little weird where the volume button is to it change vibrate/ring. I feel like this could cause the actual button on the phone to snap off. Not worth the risk of breaking an $700 phone or having to buy new chargers. I have probably 10 different ones, but the10ft charger, the one I use the most, doesn't fit. I paid $30 for it and I'm not buying another kind to see if it fits either. I decided to return this for a refund and bought a life proof instead for $12 more. Life proof is what I've been using for years. Every time I buy another brand, I always go back to it. Spend the extra money on a better case. iPhones aren't cheap. They're an investment lol<br />If this company would fix these flaws, then maybe I'd try them again in the future. This product has potential. I will say it's hard to get off the case. You'll need to use the things they send with it or a butter knife to get it off. So at least we know it's secure on our phones. But not worth those risks like I mentioned.",

I hate having just an all black case because I lose it all the time bc it blends in with my car seats and anything else black that I have. I love how it has the thumbprint plastic/rubber piece. I like it bc it protects your phone better. Everything is basically covered except for the camera and flash. I wish that was designed to be covered. Also the flap to turn your phone on silent or ringtone, that can be tough to switch if you don't have long nails. But a pen or paper clip will work fine, or just your finger.<br />Other reviews complained that people couldn't hear them talk clearly, I haven't had that issue. As soon as I put it on I made a call to check. Everyone I've talked to since I put this on has no issues hearing me. I don't have any issues either. Maybe they redesigned it since then? Or they got a dud? This also was very easy to put on my phone. All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase. I recommend it. You can't beat the price.

I mean smart phones Are not cheap so you really need to protect it. I've dropped my phone a few times in these cases and it's never broken. I reccomend this brand more than any other. It is very over priced For just two pieces of plastic but like I mentioned earlier it works great for protecting our phones. I did buy this one much cheaper but only because iPhone 5s has been out for awhile. Regular price when they first come out is around $89!

I didn't need the phone case to scream teenager nor did I need cartoons, so I went through this site looking for something that would fit into the narrow parameters I set.  When I found this one, I was very pleased. And even more pleased when it arrived. I've dropped the phone twice and both times the case protected it.  The case does not block even one function of the phone and it makes the phone quite easy to hang onto.<br /><br />I would recommend.",

    "text": "The good part is it works for the iPhone 11 Pro Max. If you're trying to stay organized and have something that just works and looks decent, this device is fine, particularly when all your toys are parked on it. The bad part is, there are 3 wires coming out the back, which is a mess, particularly if you can't drape them behind something that to hide them like a dresser with a solid back.<br /><br />Unpleasantly, to set it up for first use, you have run the wire cables for the Apple Watch, Airpod case and iPhone through the unit, routing them through the channels in the bottom.  But the wires don't stay in the channels they're supposed to sit in. They didn't put any little tabs like many similar configurations in other devices have to keep the wires from falling out, so someone would need tape or glue to ensure they don't come out when the unit moves and I think that's just not well enough designed.<br /><br />Another thing I did not like: The air pod case cable's connector floats loose in the curved hollowed-out seat where the air pod case sits. So, instead of letting you just push the airpod case down onto the connector for a solid easy to insert and remove connection, you have to still plug a loose wire into your Airpod case and then snug the case and wire back down into the seat. But that's something you'd probably be doing couple of times a day, or more because airpod cases hold a charge so you can recharge your airpods on the go, so  you may need to frequently take the case with you, so having that airpod connector loose and having to plug it in like a simple wired connector is kind of a tacky solution.<br /><br />The last thing I don't love is that the adjustable charger back plate, which is clever in the sense that it can accommodate a lot of phones, just look great when there's no phone sitting on the stand, because it's busy, with contrasting grey and black, and shows too much of the engineering for someone looking for a more refined finished look. A charging stand more suited to one particular vendor or model of phone could have the charging coils line up without adjustment and would be a cleaner and more discreet look like the other wireless charger I have, the Seneo, which looks very good and works well with my iPhone 11 Pro Max and worked well for my iPhone Xs Max for a year.<br /><br />So while this could be a fairly decent product for some people, I think it costs a bit too much particularly based on the design flaws I mentioned.",

The phone looks flawless; brand new, without a doubt. The LCD display, digitizer pad, speaker, home screen button and touch id sensor (all parts involved in the replacement job) are all functioning perfectly after the replacement.<br /><br />I used the 11 minute YouTube video by \"JerryRigEverything\"' as a guideline for doing the repair. Note: This particular LCD/digitizer unit does not have a metal backing piece, so, along with the TouchID/Home Button and speaker, needs to be transferred from the phone to the replacement assembly. Moving the metal backing is easy enough. Just 4 small screws on the side, as alluded in the video (which mentions *some* replacement units require this extra step), and a 5th screw on an adjacent part.<br /><br />Be warned, while replacing the LCD/digitizer not for the feint of heart, particularly for a first time DIYer. To do this right, you need to be steady, focused, good with your hands, and have attention to fine detail.  You may feel like a brain surgeon at times. It helps to have mechanical and electronics familiarity or some hobby or background requiring similar levels of detail oriented acuity.  All the connectors in the 5S are extremely delicate and the screws extremely tiny, and challenging to work with, in a cramped area, with several challenging access points.  It would be all too easy to botch the job, ruin a flex cable, or a connector, or misalign something, or fail to re-attach a connector properly,  lose screws, or mix them up (they are small but different sizes), put a cable or assembly bracket or cover on backwards, etc.... and wind up with a non-working phone.  So keep very close track of the order and position of everything you do by any means necessary to you can get it back together perfectly.",

Until getting an Apple watch (6), I've always worn loose, bracelet type bands, so having to keep it snug against my wrist is taking some getting used to.<br /><br />I didn't like the silicone bands, the elastic, the scrunchie types. All of them have been irritating. I've also never kept a watch on overnight.

    "text": "In time for what; you may be asking...? It came in time for me to install the screen protector, and drop my phone down inside the couch once, knock it off the arm of the chair once, and finally, the true test: my phone was knocked off the arm of the couch by the tail of one of my Great Danes, kicked down the hall, and galloped across twice by BOTH dogs, before I could grab it.. keep in mind, while the puppy is only 100 lbs, the big boy checks in at a solid 180 lbs.<br /><br />The screen protector not only didn't shatter, there's not a scratch on it.<br /><br />Now, how does it fit? Pretty well. My favorite part of the design is that the screen protector isn't cut out across the bottom to accommodate the home button/fingerprint scanner. It's a full circle/hole. That means two fewer edges/points to come up off the glass, and two fewer weak spots for cracks to start.<br /><br />The protector does create a significantly raised screen, above and beyond the edges of the case. (See photos. Same company, great fit for the cover.) There is a small amount of space between the edge of the glass and the edge of the case. This is only mildly annoying, and it's not enough to consider changing brands.<br /><br />This item comes in the package with two screen protectors, and two of everything you need to install it. I don't usually install my own screen protectors, because my hands shake, and I have trouble aligning them. Since there's two in the box, I decided to give it a try. I think it's a little off center, but that's my fault, not the manufacturer. I was a little disappointed to find that this item didn't include an alignment tool like many others.<br /><br />What it does have, is a very substantial tool to push out any air bubbles. I ended up with a lot of them. After an hour of running that thing back and forth across the air bubbles, there still wasn't a mark on the glass.<br /><br />Is it designed specifically for the iPhone SE (2020 model)? Almost, but not quite. There are spots for cameras or something on the screen protector that have no corresponding function on my phone.<br /><br />Overall, I'm recommending this. It seems very well made. It's considerably thicker than anything on the market recently, and I believe it really will keep my screen safe.",

The product, I'm sticking with 4 stars. The company though, I'd give them five for good customer support, and willingness to stand by their product.<br /><br />Update 6/26/20:  I dropped my phone, and the case split along the seam at the bottom. My phone survived without damage, but the case is now completely useless.<br /><br />These are supposed to be warrantied for 18 months. I contacted them through the customer support email on the product box, but they have not responded (36 hours).  I did expect to get at least an automated reply saying they got my email and will contact me, but I've heard nothing. I hope I do hear back soon. If not, I'll go through Amazon to enforce the warranty.<br /><br />I've only had the case for a couple days, (shipping was EXTREMELY slow) so I can't attest to it's longevity. What I can say, is that it fits my iPhone SE (2020 model) very well. It took a little to get it fitted into the case, but I'm absolutely confident that it will not come loose.<br /><br />The color is fantastic. It's a deep, vibrant red, with a slightly metallic look. It feels soft, has some kind of non-slip coating to it.<br /><br />It is very slightly raised around the camera lens, which is nice, since the new iPhone doesn't have a raised bezel to protect it. Unfortunately, this case does not offer any raised edge protection for the screen of the phone.<br /><br />This case IS absolutely compatible with wireless charging.<br /><br />One more downside though, which will probably not matter to the vast majority of people: I always attach some kind of handle to the back of my phones because I have trouble holding onto things. This case has a coating that prevents adherence to the cover. I've read that before about other cases, but the handles stuck anyway.  Not so with this one. The handles will NOT stick to the surface of this cover.<br /><br />I recommend this cover for anyone else. It's nice.. feels secure, has a nice texture, and the color is an excellent, slightly more interesting (near) match to the iphone's original color.",

Don't try to bend it as it will crack.<br /><br />I dread putting on screen protectors. I followed the instructions on the product's Amazon page (it's one of the product images at the top of the page on the left). They didn't say anything except use what is provided. This is the order that I cleaned it:<br /><br />1. The Wet Wipe (Marked #1 on it's packaging)<br />2. The Dry Wipe (Marked #2 on it's packaging)<br />3. I used the dust absorber<br /><br />Then, I pealed the thin clear film off the tempered glass using the red tab that's connected to it.<br /><br />I then turned over the side of the glass that the film pealed off from to face downward towards the watch.<br /><br />I aligned it as best as I could and then placed it on the watch and carefully pressed it down. It has no bubbles. It's aligned with the watch face. I have no complaints. :-)<br /><br />Looks nice, too.<br /><br />Plus, if you make a mistake or if the tempered glass screen protector needs to be replaced for whatever reason, you have 2 more screen protectors.<br /><br />If I have any reason going forward to not like this protector, I will update this review. For now, it went on easy and looks great. 5 stars!",

I bought the mother-of-pearl-like white one and does my mother love it! She even has her cell phone plugged into it when she plays her card games on her cell phone and my Dad always leaves the house with his cell phone plugged in when he forgot to charge his phone.

    "text": "I don't know if any of you have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2. It has a finicky usb power port. It will only work with the Samsung plug and cable it came with and Samsung will not issue me a new cable as it is fraying (my only one to every fray!)  I bought this 5-port Anker wall charger a while ago for a trip because it has 2 QC ports and it's the only one with more than one. I finally decided to try this charger with a lightening charging cable to test to see if I can charge my S2 tablet and OMG it works! Phew! You have no idea how many cables and Samsung and non-Samsung USB plugs I have swapped out trying to get the charge at its normal rate and these cables and plugs are in perfect working order, but the S2 always shows up saying it is charging too slow. Finally resolved! Thanks Anker!<br /><br />Now onto my S7 Edge. It had been charging lightening fast for the full year I have owned it. Last week, was helping to troubleshoot an older USB multiport charger that is starting to fail at my parents house. Ever since then, my S7 Edge is charging at 1/3 the rate (using battery monitoring apps for years, so I know what I am talking about). Got it home and the problem persisted (Yikes!). 4 hours of charge gave a mere 25% increase! This is not good.<br /><br />Looked online for an answer. Found one that said that this mostly fixes the problem. Ok. So I tried it. Disabled the Fast Charging in System Settings and turned it back on to connect to my Samsung plug and cable. Still, no good. Turned it back off and shutdown the phone. Brought it over to this Anker 5-port charger and attached it to a lightening cable I own and powered up my phone. Turned the fast charge setting back on. Blammo! It 20 minutes I have 40% increase. So relieved as what I found online had people turning in their S7 phones as they couldn't resolve their problem.<br /><br />Curious, I brought it back to my Samsung plug and cable. It went to 1/3rd the speed again. Sigh. Not sure why. Brought it back to this Anker charger and I'm in business again. It's almost as if the original connection to the bad (non-Anker) multiport charger caused a problem in my S7 Edge that I then transferred to the Samsung wall plug and cable? Sounds soooo crazy, I know. Not enough data points to say this is it, but it is sure acting like it. Just happy I got things working and I am back to buy another one of these :-)",

    "title": "Mounting a smart phone? Heck no! Think bigger!",
    "text": "I can't believe this worked! This magnet is fairly huge compared to the one I had for my Galaxy S5 from a different vendor. When I got my S7 edge, the my previous magnetic CD mount could barely hold it in place. I bought this one for my mother not realizing the magnet is so much larger. She later decided she didn't want to use it and gave it back to me. Since I had an extra one that looked stronger than my old one, I would give the S7 edge a try.<br /><br />It holds the S7 edge without a problem. Then, I was planning on driving over 2000 miles for an upcoming trip. I was considering at the time if I could get the Waze app to display on my 9.7&#34; Galaxy Tab S2. I dismissed it because I shouldn't be holding something like that while driving and I didn't think there was a mount available for it since it was so large.<br /><br />It then occurred to me to try the tablet on this magnetic mount. It worked! Don't put the metal plate in the center of the tablet. Put it about 1/2&#34; to an inch lower from where you would place it using the original center of the tablet (lower from the perspective of the orientation of the tablet on the mount). I have driven over 2000 miles with my tablet and a huge Waze navigation display. Yes, Waze does show more road with larger displays in the 3-D view (I don't know about the 2-D view).<br /><br />Did the tablet mount with its case on? Yes. My tablet has an Otterbox case. The outer silicone case is too heavy for this too work. It does work with the thinner inner plastic case on such that I'm still using its screen protector. I don't mind the little bouncing it does while mounted like this as it didn't fall the whole time. It turns out that keeping the inner Otterbox case on was a good idea because with all the packing and unpacking of my car, the screen got scratched, but only the Otterbox protective screen scratched. The tablet's screen is just fine. If you do have concerns about the weight of the tablet on the mount and you don't think you will scratch the screen, then place the metal plate directly onto the back of the tablet. This will also be lighter and bounce less than mine did.<br /><br />One thing to note: This magnetic CD mount barely fits into the CD player because it is too wide, unlike my old magnetic CD mount which fit perfectly. The CD player I used is only for my old navigation CD's (I don't use my car's built in navigation system anymore so this CD slot is useless). If this slot was for the music CD's, I am positive it wouldn't be practical. It is so hard to get in and I can see that the CD slot's soft material where you insert the CD is damaged. This definitely wouldn't hold up to being inserted over and over again.",

She is never walking and doing other things while using it. As such, she doesn't bobble the phone and has never needed it to protect her S7 from a fall. I hope that continues. Not because this case isn't good, but because no case will protect the screen completely. I see people complaining about this over and over again. If you think about the physics of how the phone can hit things on the way down or when it hits the ground (e.g. pebbles and rocks), you would realize it's impossible, too.<br /><br />I will say though, my mother get's lots of complements on this case which makes her pretty happy.",

It did serve the purpose of reducing wear on the USB port, but eventually the mother board died and I got it replaced under warranty from Samsung.<br /><br />Using a battery app that logs the charging rate every 5 seconds, I was able to confirm that it was charging at a quick charge rate. Using that same app, I watched it slowly die, too, until it no longer transferred a charge to my tablet.

    "text": "I tried to make this product work for me. I am not going to be using the phone underwater at all, but I wanted this case because the &#34;shockproof&#34; feature really seems to be well thought out and to a degree, it is. I tend to drop my phones because I am doing too many things at once and lose my awareness of where the phone is when this happens.<br /><br />As far as it's ability to protect the phone from me, I'm happy with the protection. Let's face the sad reality. It is hard to protect the screen of any &#34;edge&#34; smartphone. I do expect protection as long as the fall doesn't cause the screen to be directly hit. Having said that, here's the phone's pros:<br /><br />- It is waterproof. I did the water test per the manufacturer's instructions and the case was waterproof as advertised.<br />- The case surrounds the phone's edges and it's slightly raised edge protects the screen from scratches. I have a lot of experience using the shockproof cases (e.g., Ballistic Tough Jacket, Otterbox Defender, etc.) and feel qualified to say that overall, this case does protect the phone well, although I am not going to try to drop this on hard surfaces like cement. I'm not that daring.<br />- The covers on all the ports are dustproof, too. The ports are well-protected.<br />- The buttons are fully functional as long as you follow the installation instructions carefully. Retry if at first you don't succeed, which is what I had to do. Short cutting the installation instructions on this phone will lead to the phone failing to respond to the user while in this case. The only area that I ended up having a lackluster response was in the upper right corner where drop down menus can be found sometimes, like on my app manager, which I use a lot (the drop down menu, I mean).<br />- When installed correctly, the edges of my phone where fully functional.<br /><br />The first time I put the phone in the case, I wasn't using a hard surface to facilitate pressing the phone down into the front of the case well. Then the back of the case is pressed onto the front part, but without a hard surface to press down into, the case doesn't seal well in comparison to when the hard surface is used. Not doing this was the biggest problem I had and you will know you failed when you can feel the clear plastic screen protector not lying against the screen as you use the interactive area of the phone while in this case. When you install it well, there is no space and you feel like you are touching the screen (albeit, the gorilla screen's wonderful tactile properties cannot really be perfectly reproduced with any screen protector, imho).<br /><br />I have 2 cons for this case and one I cannot see past:<br /><br />- The screen protector has a mirror-like shine to it and it's far too glossy to use outside. It's almost winter and the sun is at low angles in the sky most of the day and I live only in mid-latitudes. When I'm driving using my navigation app, sometimes the phone is in the direct path of the sunlight and it obliterates my view of the screen. I drive a lot, especially on highways. During this time of year, as I head north, the sun is almost always hitting the screen and I simply can't see a thing, regardless of the brightness setting of my screen. This is the one deal breaker as the manufacturer should have used some sort of glare protection on this screen.<br />- Sound is reduced to poor quality. You have to always open the flap to have access to the microphone on the bottom and even when I do this, the people I'm talking to on the phone say my voice is somewhat muffled. Not a lot, just enough to be irritating to a few people, though. Similarly, the speakers, both internal and external are distorted. I am not an audiophile at all and even I can tell the difference. Worse, the callers are experiencing an &#34;echo&#34; which is well documented in these reviews. The manufacturer claims that this can be overcome, but there are too many show stopping problems in the sound category for me to want to put that effort in.<br /><br />Who is this phone good for?<br /><br />- People that dive or are in an area where dust is a constant problem. I would even go to say this is a great case for the beach. If you press the home button twice, the stock camera app opens up and you can easily take pictures without touching the screen, which is useful when taking underwater pictures.<br /><br />I love the beach, but once there, I'd probably only want to use this case while on the sand and take it off at all other times. I don't like the idea of taking this on and off all the time, though. I have had my other phones at the beach on numerous occasions. For my use of each of my phones there, I've never had a sand problem.  I'm not going to use it underwater and I don't live in a dusty area. With the screen reflection being blinding, which wouldn't be an issue underwater, this isn't the phone for me.",

    "title": "Best car smartphone car mount I ever owned!",
    "text": "Let me first say that I have bought car mounts of different types in the past, but this is the only one that really worked for me. Quite honestly, I love this thing. My car is old enough that I still have a CD player and as a bonus, I have an additional &#34;navigation&#34; CD slot that's separate from my CD player that is for my outdated navigation CDs to use with the car's outdated navigation system. Since the navigation CD slot is not in use and it's perfectly located high up on the dash, this was a good decision just from a &#34;where to locate the smartphone car mount&#34; perspective.<br /><br />I chose to put the metal plate on the outside of my ballistic jacket case. They aren't manufactured anymore, but they were way better than the otterbox (only comparing this to give people an idea of the metal plate placement for this car mount) and perhaps that's why putting the plate on the inside of the phone's case or on the outside of the phone's case (not the ballistic jacket case itself) just didn't create a strong connection to the magnet.<br /><br />Putting the magnetic plate on the outside of the ballistic case has caused absolutely no problems with my handling of my phone during normal use when the phone is off of the car mount. It is a thin metal plate that does not add to the form factor thickness of the case. People who are having trouble getting a strong magnetic connection may consider doing this. One thing of note, I put this on during the hot summer months. About 3 weeks later, the glue failed and the phone dropped off the mount with the metal plate being attached to the magnet on the car mount, instead of remaining glued to the case. Since I was satisfied with the overall function of the magnetic connection to the mount, I simply put superglue on the the metal plate and it has been perfect ever since.<br /><br />I did have the experience to position the magnetic mount such that the phone was perfectly vertical. When you hit those bad potholes (I do try to avoid them for the sake of my car's suspension, but sometimes you simply can't avoid them or they sneak up on you), the phone would dislodge from the mount due to the jolt. The solution is simple and that's to angle the magnetic mount such that the phone is on a little bit of the slant so that the vertical force of the vehicle's jolt on the mount has some horizontal opposing force upwards against the vertical downward jolt. Works perfectly.<br /><br />My phone has incurred absolutely no negative effects as a result of it's proximity to the magnet mount point. For those who are saying the magnet isn't strong enough, I would suggest purchasing a stronger magnet and placing it on the already magnetized mount. Problem solved. I didn't have to do this, but instead of throwing your money away on a perfectly good car mount, simply drop a few cents to remedy your magnetic connection if moving the metal plate to the outside of the case still doesn't work for you (after all, some phones or some phones + their case can be pretty heavy and you may need a little more of a boost, although my Samsung S5 phone with it's ballistc case and a bit of a tilt of the mount is all I needed to establish a sufficiently strong magnetic connection).<br /><br />I'm glad I took the chance on buying one more car mount. This time, it was definitely worth it!",

    "text": "UPDATE: 2017/07/11 (Prime Day, 2017):<br /><br />I came across this old review and what is old never got old. What I mean is, it has been 3 years since I bought these cases and my personal phone is still same S5 in the same Ballistic Jacket Case (this one, in fact!)  I am telling no lie here. This is the best darned case EVER. I remain uncoordinated and still am dropping my phone all the time and my phone has NEVER flaked out. I keep the OS running smoothly and efficiently (which is why I have yet to replace it and let me tell you, I have loaded it up with apps and still keep adding apps!). I have had no reason to spend any money on a replacement phone and I know that if I ever have to upgrade the phone, I will be seeking out another Ballistic Jacket Case!<br /><br />I had another amazing drop like I did years ago and in the same way, but worse. As it was dropping, I chased after it with my hand again and instead of catching the phone, I slammed my hand on it which then slammed, not dropped, the phone onto concrete. It slammed so hard that the phone bounced around more times than I ever saw it bounce!! This just happened a few months ago. So the case is like 3 years old now and not a scratch on the phone from the falls it has taken. Literally, the case is still looking pretty darn good, too!<br /><br />UPDATE: 2015/02/20<br /><br />These cases are the cat's meow for sure. I can't tell you how many times I've bobbled my phone with the Ballistic Tough Jacket case on it only to have failed to catch it and then have to watch the phone bounce around on the floor or ground till it stops. Every time, not a single thing is wrong with my phone or the case. The funniest one, as I am a bit clumsy, was when the phone started to drop from between my ear and shoulder while I was on the phone. As it was falling down my arm, I started trying to catch it (i.e., I was bobbling it). Then somehow, in one of my attempts to catch it, the back of my hand slammed, in a downward motion, the top of the phone and it landed on the ground so hard it was like I spiked the phone (like spiking a football). I watched in horror as it slams into the ground and bounces all around till it came to a rest. This time because of the impact, I'm afraid to see what I did to it. I picked it up very gingerly and inspected everything. To my utter relief, there was absolutely nothing wrong with it and the call I was on was still connected.<br /><br />This was is my 2nd purchase of 3 of these cases. Apparently, I like them a lot! ;-)<br /><br />Easy to put on and take off and the rubber bumpers, raised corners, and even rubber backing on the hard shell. I've already dropped the phone that this particular case is protecting and there's not a scratch on the phone or the Ballistic case and the phone continues to operate without a problem. It doesn't come with a screen protector, though. I bought the tempered glass screen protector from Luvvitt (sold here on Amazon) and this screen protect and the Ballistic Tough Jacket case are a great match. Highly recommend both.",

It was clear to me that I needed a really strong screen protector, not the plastic film type and I came across the [[ASIN:B00IKRHCCY LUVVITT® Samsung Galaxy S5 TEMPERED GLASS Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S5 - Crystal Clear]] and I'm loving it. Just be careful on your purchase. Luvvitt says that their tempered glass for the S5 Active does not fit the standard S5. I don't have the S5 Active, so the link above is for the standard S5.<br /><br />With Amazon having a great price on the Ballistic jacket than the manufacturer's web site, that gave me wiggle room to buy the Luvvitt Tempered Glass. Together they make the perfect pair for protecting the S5 and purchased together, they are the same price of the Ballistic jacket on the manufacturer's website.",

    "text": "This case is refreshingly easy to put on. It is not as complicated as the OtterBox. I have returned my OtterBox for this case based on reviews for the Ballistic case on both on Amazon and the manufacturers site. If they are true, this should be a pretty impressive case.<br /><br />No features of the S5 have been hampered by this case. Hearing clarity remains above average and no problems with the fingerprint scanner. It's raised and reinforced corner bumpers and extra cushion on the back of the hard case (don't forget there's already an inner jacket) adds to extra shock absorption.<br /><br />This did not come with a screen protector and I didn't want the bulkier Tough Jacket Maxx which has both the screen protector and a belt clip. Since this case is about 1/2 the price on Amazon than on the manufacturer's site, I decided to get a really good screen protector for this really good case. I chose the  &#34;LUVVITT® TEMPERED GLASS Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S5 - Crystal Clear&#34; on Amazon, too. Together, I think the two products make a great pair and the total cost for the 2 is about the same price as the Tough Jacket on the manufacturer's web site.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a well protected S5.",
