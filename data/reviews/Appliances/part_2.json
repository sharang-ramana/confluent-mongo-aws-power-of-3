Cans fit on the shelves and door easily.  The little freeze compartment is nice for small things and even frozen candy bars.  The control knob is simple to operate.  Just turn to desire ‘numbered' temperature range.  Very quiet.  As you can see my head and pillow are right above it and I don't even hear it at night.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)",

The desk itself is a medium to heavy weight, it won't tip over or shake.  The top black wood looks really good.  It has solid metal legs too.  Assembly was easy, just bolt on the legs and screw on door knob handles.  Everything was packed safe and securely.",

Just plug it in, fill it up with water under the basket, and choose the size of your ice cubes.  And no maintenance required.  The are 2 sizes of ice cubes to choose from.  It really does make ice in minutes!!!  There is a drain plug at the bottom of the machine and you just pull it out to drain the machine if your going to leave it off for an extended time.

    "text": "I'm a decent sized guy and lift things around the house often but this things still about more than I can carry myself! I recommend using a dolly and then two people to hoist it up to where it's going. Then you need to run the drain hose to a sink drain or a big 5 gallon bucket would work (just make sure you have the hose secure or it could flop out and drain in the floor) Then you can hook this up to a sink or you can fill it's tank. I filled it's tank completely as I want to go that route and I loaded it up. Once the thing started running, I filled the tank all the way up again and it didn't have to be filled again for the whole wash cycle so it's pretty convenient. I think it'd be able to do everything on one full tank.<br /><br />SO this is a smaller dishwasher and one level so you could fit one large pot and a couple cups maybe. But if you're doing little things- you can still fit a few things! It took it about an hour to run it's regular cycle and then it'd run it's fan for an hour drying it and pop open automatically when it's done. I just opened the door once it was done and let it all air dry though- no sense in having it dry things if you're not in a hurry.<br /><br />Some things I love about this are: the UV light while drying (never seen that in a dishwasher!), it's very quiet- you could run it in an apartment at night without it being too loud, it cleans just as good as my full sized expensive $1100 dishwasher did! I had some dishes that hadn't been cleaned for a couple weeks because I was sick and I threw them in and they came out spotless! A couple pieces of silverware had a tiny bit of food residue but that happens with most dishwashers so no biggie- just sponge cleaned it off and rinsed it in seconds.<br /><br />This thing would absolutely be great for an RV, tiny home, or just on the counter of a rental. On the rental- I'd check with the landlord first as some don't want you using a washer or dishwasher due to potential water leaks. But if it's allowed- get this thing, you will love it!! I truly never thought these mini dishwashers would clean so well but they do! Cleaning them is much easier than a full size too- it's super easy to pull the screen out and clean it!<br /><br />No complaints or improvements that I can think of at all! It's heavy but it does the job so I'm fine with that!",

For an ice chest you'll probably be working at it for a while as this thing makes a handful of cubes every few minutes. The thing I love about this ice maker is it has a smaller profile than many of them I've seen. Many are much larger and bulkier. This one's not too bad at all. After using this thing a few times I can say that we love it! Seems to be well made and works perfectly.<br /><br />The small ice and large ice are the exact same size, the large ice just stays on the metal rods longer so they become thicker. Both of them come out thin enough I can put them in my hand and just crush them completely. I honestly love this ice and am very happy with this!<br /><br />To make Ice you just fill the bottom reservoir with water up to it's \"Max\" fill line which is marked \"Max\" and then it sucks water from that up to the top reservoir where the metal rods are cooled to the point that ice starts forming on them. Once the ice is ready it will drop the ice and the little motorized scoop will scoop it down into the little ice tray. Very easy to use and fun to watch!",

The most used cycle 'normal' will not even rinse the clothes, bulky won't spin the clothes and heavy refuses to rinse as well. It came with multiple dents all three times I've received the washer. This one the third washer only has four dents in it whereas the rest we're so bad I wouldn't even keep them if they worked. But they didnt. Also why is there a 2-hour delay if I use cold water on the normal cycle... That's just crazy.<br /> I even bought an extended warranty and for some reason I'm having trouble getting anybody to hear me out about my washing machine. If I spend over $300 on an item I expect it to work on all settings. Also this product would be way more maneuverable if I had multiple wheels on all four sides instead of just two in the back You almost have to tip the machine completely on its side to get it to roll. And the handles are so low on the machine I'm not sure exactly how they're supposed to be worked.<br />Super disappointed in Black & Decker also for not backing up your products.<br />So in conclusion if you would like a washer that works halfway this is the one for you!

This cleaner and descaler have worked wonders for my ice machine. I didn't realize that my ice could take on a weird taste after a while and then I cleaned it and it really helped take that weird taste from my ice. It also helped with the leaking my ice machine was doing because of the scaling and buildup that I had no idea that was going on. This worked so well and I will continue using it from here on out. It was also super easy to use and just works.",

The filters make it super easy to clean my reusable cups with just simply throwing out or composting the grounds and filter; rinse the k-cup and you're done. So much easier than using them without filters. As far as the price of this, well if you bought everything separately then it would be a little more expensive, however this is a one time purchase kit because I wouldn't want to have to buy more reusable kcups just to get the filters that I can get from someone else. Either way though, I am happy with this set and the kcups work great and hold up perfect for making coffee ahead of time to have when ready to use them. Great set.",

    "text": "I really like coffee but I am a huge tea drinker and love to take tea with me when I am on the go but sometimes it can be a pain to brew up a cup of my loose leaf when I need to get going in the morning. Now that I have discovered this however, it has changed things for me. I can totally put in my loose leaf tea and brew it from my Keurig. I know there are a lot of different reusable K-cup things out on the market and while many of them are great (which I own quite a few) sometimes you want a little more filtration and that is where these comes in. The filters that come with these are great and really make for a nice cup of tea, without any of the fine residue that can come from loose leaf tea but it also makes for a great smooth cup of coffee too. Either way you go, you can't go wrong with these. I keep them in my tea box for whenever I want to make a quick cup of tea for the road and the cool part is that I have even reused the filters (for the same type of tea, of course) and they can work again and again for at least to help brew up two to four more cups, at least. They might not recommend doing that, but I like to get every cent out of something and I can even help the environment too by using these, love them.<br /><br />Now the cups on the other hand aren't my favorite at all. It's just like a k-cup, thin plastic. The first time you use it the Keurig will make one hole on the top and one on the bottom of the cup and in order to use it again you can either pop it in and not worry about the other hole or line it up perfectly so that no other holes are made. Yeah, to much work for a cup of tea, for me. While they work just like a k-cup, I didn't reuse them like I did the filters. I actually used the filters in a reusable k-cup that I already had which, for me, worked much better than trying to use these plastic cups. I would totally buy this for the filters but not for the cups.",

I actually called Keurig and a representative talked me through the process of removing one of the machine parts and replacing it with the sleeve that comes with the filter. That process could have been made a little bit more clear in the written instructions that came with the filters, but the representative was very patient and helped me all the way until I had it working properly. Yeah! It works great. I highly recommend getting the REAL Keurig filters and not one of the knock-offs out there. I've tried a few of those and couldn't get some of them to work properly.

    "text": "I've wanted a built-in ice maker for some time.  There are 7 of us sharing the ice maker in a fridge and it just never cut it!  I had two options in ice makers:  nugget or cube.  Nugget ice is much more fun, but it's not good for coolers.  Cube ice works for both.  So I got the cube maker.  If I ever win the lottery, I'll get the other one too!<br /><br />Anyway, the machine was a pain to install, but that's not its fault.  First I hired someone because they had to move my fridge, tap a water line, and break through the wall to install the drain.  They screwed all of that up and I ended up with a leak, a damaged fridge, and the drain line was leaking as well.  They fixed two of the three a week later and now it works well (though the fridge is another story).  The instructions were poor, that caused some of the problem (even the professional misread them).  I mean, if you're selling a $500 product, can't you afford proper instructions with real pictures written by someone who speaks English?<br /><br />All that aside, there is one thing I took off a star for:  The unit doesn't stay frozen!  It makes ice and dumps it in a fridge.  It melts because that is a fridge not a freezer.  And then it makes more ice.  This causes a lot of wasted water and electricity, and it means that you absolutely must have that drain line installed!<br /><br />I had another one of these some time back that cost a lot less and made about half as much ice a day.  That one was insulated and stayed below 0, so the ice never melted!  I didn't even connect the drain line and in 4 years of use, it never leaked.  If I were to go back to the start of this project, I would have gotten that again.  That's the reason I took off a star.  The other style would have saved energy and cost $200 instead of $500...  But overall, considering that I got the item at a discount here, I'm okay with this outcome.",

    "text": "If you're searching for this, you know what it is.  My gas range is the standard 36\" range with built-in oven that is found in many homes.  Nothing fancy.  The problem is that there is a small gap between the range and the cabinet/countertop that food or liquid can fall into.<br /><br />These Stainless Steel Stove Gap Covers solves exactly this problem.  Due to its proximity to the fire and heat, the gap cover must be metal and because will be exposed to oils and other food particles, it needs to be easy-to-clean.  These covers fit both criteria.<br /><br />With an extendable piece, these covers can fit all ranges regardless of the depth of the stove and there is a small metal piece that is supposed to provide tension when inserted into the gap.  Unfortunately, this is where I have the first problem with this product.  The tension just isn't enough to keep the gap cover in the gap snugly.  I think a cork or silicone piece would help give it the friction in needs to stay in place.<br /><br />The second problem I have is that the product is in the shape of the letter \"T\" but because there is a slight difference in height between my range and the counter, it has to tilt to one side, further making it hard for the cover to stay in place.<br /><br />The last issue is the extension part.  It doesn't lock into a position.  Without it, you can accidentally push on the cover and shorten it.  It would be better to have some sort of locking mechanism that will keep it to the length that you set.<br /><br />This product does what its intended for, but I think a few tweaks and it would be perfect (I might just look to see if I can make these tweaks myself).",

    "text": "I've seen video reviews of products such as this BOSALY Ice Maker Machine.  It promises to make ice in 9 minutes and I gotta say, it does just that.  This ice maker can make two sizes of ice.  In my testing, small ice cubes can be made in 9 minutes while the large one takes 11.  I think it is necessary to set some expectations for this unit for those who are interested.  If you know these things ahead of time, you will not be disappointed by your purchase:<br /><br />This ice maker is fairly heavy, but that is to be expected because of the compressor.  Also due to the compressor, this until will not work with power from a car adapter so as far as portability, you'd need to make sure there is a wall outlet or a generator that you can plug it into or you'll be draining a lot of battery power.<br /><br />It must also be pointed out that the ice made by this machine is quite wet due to how the ice is made.  It means that if you make ice with this machine, then put them into your freezer, you'll end up with one big lump of ice.<br /><br />With that said, this machine does EXACTLY what I want it to do: make ice during a small gathering without the need for much oversight.  Just make sure the water tank is filled.<br /><br />Here are the features I like:<br />-- Portable.  Be the savior of the party by bringing the ice maker for a friend's party.<br />-- Auto stop when the water level is low or the basket is filled.<br />-- Plug at the bottom allows draining of excess water.<br />-- FAST.  9 pieces of ice cube are made with each batch.  That's enough for two cups.<br />-- Convenient.  Make sure the machine is filled with water and plugged in.  Come back once in a while to dump out the basket to make more ice or to refill the water.<br />-- Useful.  This will definitely make a difference during a party.  There are too many other things to worry about when preparing for guests.<br /><br />Overall, great product.",

    "text": "We recently moved to a new home in Florida.  Prior to moving here I had decided to install a whole house dehumidifier.  After installing it I wanted to be able to monitor the temperature and humidity levels throughout my house - I have done this using a few different methods, one of which is this set.<br /><br />These simple small devices are easy to read and even easier to operate - just pull the tab and use.<br /><br />My only complaint is 2 of the 10 in this set did not work out of the box.  At this price it really is still reasonable for 8 units but not as great as for 10.<br /><br />I have found these units work well, the batteries last a long time and the price is reasonable.  While I wish all 10 of the units worked it still is a good set that I recommend.",

    "text": "It's been 9 weeks since I've bought this item and its total piece of JUNK!  As stated below I've has to replace on a yearly basis since orginal went out.  But 9 weeks this is an absolute RIP OFF.  I'm so pissed right now because i will have to blow dry until a better one arrives.  EVEN WORSE I find out the reason it stopped working isnt because it blew out.  NO NO NO. its because it has melted the wire plug and the plug housing on the element itself.  This could have ruined my life I couldve lost everything I've worked for. Thank God it didnt catch fire and ruin me and my family like.others have complained about.  Very lucky it just melted the plugs and no fire.<br />This issues CAN NOT be blamed on my install or lack of knowledge either.  I'm an exp. Electrician and I know what I'm doing and I know what I'm talking about. This is a cheaply made element and isnt worth saving money or time shipping to possibly loose everything.<br />I did buy a replacement again on amazon. Different seller and it's a different style.og element.  The difference is the hood over top the element itself.  They sell it for 4.95 and it is the same style I buy on line from a fridge company for 20$. No rather it last as long idk yet. But u you can read that review as well by clicking my name and viewing my older reviews.  As always I will update and take serious my reviewing comments.  Rank 4k and climbing for a reason.  Good luck and be smart<br /><br />Helpful hint do a google search for your element number and buy from someone other than amazon.  These are not worth 2$  it's better to spend 20% and wait 5 days than this crap..  return window just closed 20 days ago which makes this even more of a sting.<br />DO NOT BUY I cant stress this enough DO NOT BUY<br /><br />Works perfectly for my fridge.<br />I have seen alot of review talking about these not lasting very long.  Heres my years of experience with this replacement element issues.<br />I bought my fridge used and really cheap because the people couldnt figure out how to fix it and thought it was trash.<br />Well the element was issue.<br />BUT<br />EVER since I replaced the element NO MATTER WHAT BRAND!! I have to replace once a year.  Always in Aug because of the Alabama heat and humidity.  My fridge runs really hard in summer months and ALWAYS blows out the element.  So dont judge by those comments.  I'm at year 5 now with the element issue and it isnt a brand thing i can promise you. It is just one of those things.  This time around I replaced everything (included in this kit) let's see if that makes a difference. Idk though<br /><br />The difference between all the others I've bought and this one is the guard over the element.  The previous ones did not have the metal covering the top of element and that always made me wonder how it could last long with water dripping on a glowing red element.  This one just may last a little longer because of that guard over the top only time will tell.<br /><br />It seems well made, it is the right size thank God because the last time i bought, I could only find 8\" ones but I got 2 for 22$.  And even being 4\" shorter they still lasted 1 year almost to the day. The price is about same I've paid in all years past as well.  2st time ordering on Amazon though but I 3xpext no changes and will buy a other one for a backup when this one does go out.  I've learned its ALWAYS BEST to buy 2 at a time that way your not waiting for shipping and loosing meat.  I always defr6with a blow drier and this has to be repeated every 2 days until replacement element arrives.  It's a pain yes but better than smelling rotting food.<br /><br />It is something we've gotten used too.  It's either spend 20$ a year replacing the elements or Buying a new fridge @2k+.  And I'm not down for that the thing works perfectly u til Aug rolls around..lol<br />This is the first time I've gotten the while kit.  I've never replaced my thermostat or sensor. I think mine are working fine.  But I went ahead and replaced them anyways just incase that's what may be contributing to my yearly replacement.  Time will only tell and I will update as needed.  I will be the 1st to report if it last longer or shorter than a year. But please only expect a year out of the replacement your lucky if you get more.<br /><br />I have not been paid for ANY review I've ever left. (I wish I did though) This is, as always, just my opinion through my eyes to help others.<br />If you find this review helpful, please vote, so Amazonian browsers can better learn, research and understand how products work for them.!.  Thank you and Happy Buying<br />Good luck to everyone",

That said, when you're using both of the burners at the same time, the energy output is split between the two burners, so both of them will not be able to be on highest heat at the same time. This means that if you want to boil water for pasta, for example, it will take almost 20 minutes to get your water to boil. And it will take about 20 minutes for your pasta to cook. Another thing I don't like about the stove top is the fact that the cooking surface always looks dirty. No matter how much you clean it the circle that the pot rests on is slightly textured. And the surface never seems to come clean.",

I mean flawlessly! The unit's temperature can be split. The bottom can be chilled down much colder than the top. The touch screen makes it easy to see exactly what temp each zone is. The wood racks slide out completely so you can modify your interior space as needed. There is an interior light. And since the door is glass/see through, this is handy because you don't have to open the door to see your inventory. The unit is whisper quiet.

    "text": "This has been a very nice alternative to drip-drying my riding gear in the winter & I can use it in the garage. I really love the blower hose for drying my boots. I have gear with straps & pads plus heated gear that I can't tumble dry & some of it takes forever to air dry. This dryer takes a couple of hours but hours is better than the days it would take for some of the thicker gear. The bag is very well thought out & designed. The parts fit together well, fold up small & there is a nice metal bracket inside that separates the clothes hangers inside. The storage box is nice but everything has to be separated & broken down to use it so I probably won't put it away until things warm up & I can dry outside.<br />The shoe adapter works well for shoes but doesn't reach far enough down to dry my boots. I have just been sticking the hose in the bottom of each boot & drying them 1 at a time which works great.<br />The diagrams are pretty good for assembly but using the fan & heater is very confusing just going by the instructions. Operation isn't difficult but the instructions are incomprehensible to read. There are 2 heat settings & the time is adjustable at 30 minutes intervals from 30 to 360 minutes.<br />There is a sticker on the side of the heater that indicates that P1 is high temperature & P2 is low temperature. That is not clear in the instructions & I had it backward at first after reading through them multiple times.<br />The cord is very long which is nice. There is a level switch on the heater that turns off the fan if it is tipped over. The switch is very sensitive & sometimes it's hard to get it level enough when its hanging in the bag. Even the weight of the cord can tilt it enough to turn it off.",

    "text": "The hood looks great & matches our other SS appliances well. It goes a long way to tying the room together. The fan is very quiet on low & acceptable on high. I thought my wife would object to the sound on high but she didn't think it was too much & we probably wouldn't run it on high all that much anyway.<br />We love the LED lights & use them a lot. They do a great job of illuminating the range and the spaces under the cabinets on either side. I do wish it had a dimmer knob or multiple setting for the LEDs. I mounted it at 30\" above the counter which was about 28\" above the range. It seemed high at first but, after 2 weeks in the kitchen, it is perfectly natural.<br />The stainless steel on the hood is very easy to wipe clean. The stainless on the chimney collected a lot of fingerprints during installation & is harder to clean. I don't anticipate the upper parts needing to be cleaned all that much but it was an observation.<br />The installation instructions are very good & I appreciate that. They provide charts for where the screws should go to achieve the desired height above the range instead of making the installer figure out the drops & all that. There are 2 places in the instructions that say \"height above 36\" High range\" which was very confusing. I must have read through it a dozen times before I came to the conclusion that it probably meant '36\" WIDE range'.<br />This is the first time I have installed one of these & I expected it to be a big job. We renovated the kitchen in this house before we moved in & the only thought I had to the vent hood was to drop an electrical outlet in the space. The hood needs framing behind the drywall to mount, everything else can be hung with the included drywall hangers. I had to move my outlet from the center to the side, drop in some wood behind the drywall & I also modified the mounting plate to connect directly to a stud that was off-center. It looks rough but it's all hidden behind the chimney now. Simply replacing an old vent probably wouldn't involve all of that.<br />Final mounting & assembly with the connected pipe & chimney pieces was tricky for me. Now that I have done it, I would do it in a different order than the instructions stated but an experienced installer probably already knows that.<br />The hood arrived very well packed & with a thick plastic wrap around the stainless parts. That kind of detail & the good instructions leads me to believe this is going to be a quality product.",

I'm not sorry I did. It holds the same amount as my RCA washer did yet is much smaller, quieter, and faster. The only thing I'm confused about is I'm not sure how to operate it..I'm just guessing right now as I am going blind and can't read the small print on the booklet that came with it. I'm trying to find an online version so I can enlarge it with my computer. Other than that it's a great little machine at a good price. I highly recommend it!

    "text": "I have an LG LDS4821ST that needs a replacement heater part with this model number. Unfortunately, this one does not make a good seal around the opening, causing the part to leak when the tub fills with water during a cycle.<br />The etching/writing on it looks a little bit different from the one it is replacing, as well as the material used for the rubber gasket (the older one looks like it has a line/crease going through the middle, this one does not). I tried one from a different supplier (not on Amazon) and it also claimed to be a real LG part yet looks like this one and also leaks. On that one, I was told maybe I had to tighten it more, so I tightened the nut and it still leaked. I tightened it more, and it still leaked again. Finally I took it out to my old one back in (it doesn't heat, but at least I can clean my dishes on the Quick cycle without the drying mode) and it worked fine. The one I overtightened came out bent from tightening it so hard the metal actually warped. No one can claim I didn't try tightening it enough now.<br /><br />I'm guessing they changed the manufacturing and the new ones don't seal properly in the older washers like mine. The older one went in and sealed without overly tightening it again. I'm not sure where to find a good one other than ebay now for a used one.<br />Some people claim this works for them, so I'm guessing they have newer washers than mine. Two stars because it's a good price compared to other suppliers online if this model works for you. Otherwise, if you're trying to revive an older washer like mine, I'd say go elsewhere. Zero stars.",

    "text": "I've used portable dishwashers before and they are AWESOME for people who travel or have dietary restrictions (Kosher, for example, need separate washers for milk and meat dishes). The good news is, this actually seems like it does a decent job and even comes with some complimentary detergent and jet dry in the box, so you can get up and running right away... in some cases, at least. I say that because depending on how you hook it up, you may need additional hardware to connect to your water lines and/or sink.<br />Here's my problem with it- they claim it is a \"countertop\" style washer, but the thing is actually too big for my counter! I don't have enough clearance under the cabinets to fit, and it has a lot of hoses and tubing to connect as well. I was considering drilling into my counter to feed the tubes to the water supply and drain, but decided to try connecting to the sink instead when we saw it wasn't fitting well under the cabinets. But then it is too close to the sink and with the hoses etc connected, it looks like it is taking over the kitchen more than just an appliance on the counter like a toaster.<br />I've seen smaller counter-top dishwashers that would easily fit better in our space. Perhaps this one does a better job, but at this point I feel like it is too big to fit the way I intended to use it, but too small to be one we install permanently in the cabinet space. Perhaps someone else will find this size useful, I'm a little disappointed because I was so excited for this to work.",

This is good for travelling and even camping, since it is relatively easy to use and clean and doesn't require much else to work. The mesh is good about keeping the grounds out of your coffee, however I did notice a little more at the bottom of my cup than I do with a paper filter. Perhaps I need to try a more coarse grind, as fine grounds are getting through a little.<br />What makes it so petite are the arms that fold up for storage and then fold out to hold itself over the cup. The only issue with this, however, is that the arms hold the filter partially submerged, so you can never fill the cup to the top. If using with a tall mug, this is fine, especially if you leave room for milk. But with a standard 8 or 10 oz disposable cup, you might find that you can't get enough coffee out of it at a time as the filter sits about 1/4 of the cup down.<br />It definitely has its uses, but know the limitations before you get it.",

Usually it is just the bare igniter, but this one also comes with a spare set of porcelain heat-resistant wire nuts! That's a huge bonus since one time I accidentally broke off some wire inside the nut and couldn't reuse my original ones. None of the local hardware stores had the heat resistant kind like these in stock so I needed to order them separately on Amazon last time this happened.

    "text": "We have an old Caloric brand wall oven that came with the house. I have no idea how old it is, but within a year or two of living here, the oven stopped working. It would glow, but no gas would come out and it would never start. I called an appliance repair man who determined it was a bad ignitor. He explained to me that the gas won't turn on until the ignitor reaches a certain temp, so either the ignitor wasn't getting hot enough, or it wasn't sending the signal to turn on the gas when it did. Either way, the problem was entirely with the ignitor. He replaced it, and something like $200 later, the oven was back to working. Until it stopped working again about a year after that. This time it didn't even glow, the oven would just do nothing.<br /><br />Instead of another expensive repair, I decided on a hunch to assume the part the repair man brought was lower quality than the original. I looked it up online and found a match here on Amazon. I felt confident that I could swap it myself now that I saw the repair guy do it, and sure enough this did the trick for a fraction of what I would pay him to come back! Its been a little over a month since putting it in, and so far so good. I'm hoping this will last longer than the last one, but even if it doesn't, worst case scenario is that I'll spend $20-30 on an annual repair until we can afford to replace the whole oven!

I have no time in the morning to brew a whole pot of coffee & when I get home at night, I'm not in the mood for the fuss of cleaning out a pot.  So this was my solution.<br /><br />I did hesitate on buying it being I am a huge Dunkin Donuts fan.  I live on their coffee!  I couldn't see switching brands just to buy the Keurig, but I did once I saw they sold this special filter.<br /><br />I received the filter today & went right into the kitchen to put it to work.  First off, removing the Keurig filter was easy.  The filter came right out.  The reuseable filter slipped right in & I didn't have any problems.  Granted this review is based on my first use, but to be honest, I think it should last if I take care of it.<br /><br />I'm going to use it again when I'm in the mood for my own coffee versus the K cup.<br /><br />For the record - Timothy's Winter Carnival is the BEST!",

Way better than having to pay someone to do it!  We replaced all four supports, the arch, foam and the belt (which wasn't worn, but figured since we had it open might as well).

I ended up sending my partner to the hardware store with the white hose that's suppose to attach to the faucet and the piece of the faucet that screws off and he managed to come back with a whole new house (a black washer machine hose) and a new piece that connects to the faucet. It came out to approximately $20. Reviews weren't joking when they said there's a learning curve. The instruction manual seems like it was imputed on Google Translate so it doesn't make any sense. However, even with all of this I dig the little washer. I was able to wash 2 loads the first day using the bucket system and 4 loads the second day with the new hose attachment. Clothes come out quite dry if you don't over stack it and will completely dry out in a couple of hours if you leave the windows open so the warmth can hit It. I live in a city apartment so lugging my laundry to the laundry mat every week was a no-no. This was a quick little fix (thanks to my partner haha). One thing I love is how light it is, you can literally carry it anywhere, although I recommend buying a small trolley if you'll be moving it around your place or planting it somewhere accessible to a faucet. It's so small it's not a sore eye.",

So first of I figured I would see if I would have this issue with this filter and I am happy to report I do not! The water where I live has a taste so I prefer not to drink it straight out of the faucet and prefer it from my fridge, hey I got it so why not use it! With this filter I have no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />I just got this filter and this is my review based on about 2 weeks or so, so we will see how it will work out in the long run and if it will last the 6 months that I did get out of the Samsung filter and the other one, but so far I am not complaining and will stick to this brand in the future purchases.",

Until then, I'm keeping my receipt to use when this happens so Bosch can refund me.  I'd advise others to do the same.  Paid $26 which included Prime Shipping 4/24/21.",

This is when using beans ground to the “drip” setting by my local roaster.

We have been getting by on the old superglued ones for a while, so when I saw these I took the chance. They fit our nice Samsung Duo range PERFECTLY. They aren't 100% perfect, as the \"Lite\" label isn't precisely where the \"Lite\" setting is, but it doesn't matter when these are a quarter of the price of the real Samsung ones; if you use your range enough you know where the settings are anyway.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:756db57a0a5f292ae2d8a278120107f7]] The filters arrived as described with no issues from shipping. I inspected both filters and the only thing I noticed different from the OEM was the cartridge inside the canister rattled. The OEM filter does not.  This concerned me initially but all the water does is pass into the canister through the filter material and out. After reviewing pictures I can speculate it is due to a free floating design and that the space inside the cartridge allows for water passage around and through the filter material, thus accounting for the rattle. I do not believe the rattling affects the filters ability to function as intended.<br /><br />Another thing that I noticed was a date on the box of 12/21/2022.  I do not know what this means but since it does not have exp. in front I will assume it is a manufactured/packaged dated.<br /><br />So, I was able to install the filter with no problems. Water cycled through without leaking.  After a few gallons cycled to remove air, activity the material and clean out the line I tasted the water with no discernible differences from before to after replacement. The USWF filter is stated to be 0.5 micro, which is good and will capture very small particles but I can not substantiate this.  All I can say is the filter installed with no issues, it did not leak and water tasted good from the dispenser.<br /><br />Overall, it is a descent replacement filter. Since both filters rattled I assume this is not a defect but just how it is designed.  I will monitor for leaks and update my post accordingly.  Based on value, form, fit and function I would recommend.",

I removed the existing air filter which was an OEM filter and refrigerator and compared them.  The only differences were color tint and the Binazon had more tape, one piece per side while OEM only had two pieces.  The Binazon is actually a better quality fair filter in my opinion.<br /><br />Measurements are close to those stated in the ad.  The difference is not enough to matter about 1/16”.  The Binazon appear to be made from the same material as OEM…plastic. The Binazon filter fit right into the mount and was easliy installed with no issues.<br /><br />These are a great buy for the price and overall quality. I would recommend to others.",

Every 20 seconds might even be better.<br /><br />I got no instructions as how to cook pizza in it.  I had to watch videos and read online about them.<br /><br />Be sure to preheat your oven.  YouTube videos say to preheat it for about 20 minutes on high.  I did this.  I used a infrared thermometer to check the heat on the pizza stone at the front and the back.  There was well over 200 degrees difference on the front and back of the stone.  Is this normal?<br /><br />There has to be a much better design with more even heat.<br /><br />I was very excited to get this.  I went out and got enough stuff to make many pizzas.  I was so underwhelmed with the whole thing that I will probably make my next pizza in the oven.  I can actually see in my oven.  You can't see the back of the pizza in this pizza oven, so it is hard to tell when it is burning.

I'm able to use this with my regular sized Keurig, but need to remove the inner plastic ring for my Keurig Mini Plus in order for this cup to fit. It takes a bit of testing with different types of ground coffee to figure out how much to fill the cup with to have the maximum coffee flavor and strength without getting coffee sludge at the bottom of your cup. I wish this cup would have a marker on the inside to indicate how much to fill it up to. Another con is that the top of the cap doesn't lock or snap shut. If you're like me and wanted to prefill the cups every 4 days so you can grab and go, I recommend putting it in a glass airtight container (if you want to be more eco-friendly) or else the coffee might lose its flavor from the air exposure. Aside from that, I don't have any other complaints about the product. The metal mesh is fine enough to keep most coffee grounds out of your cup. If you want a ground free coffee, you may need to put a paper coffee filter in your cup because the finest grounds will still fall through the mesh.<br /><br />In comparison to the Keurig universal K-cup, I would say I prefer the universal K-cup more. I like my coffee to be strong and bold with flavor. K-cup Keurig sells has a larger capacity to hold more coffee grounds that allows me to get that result I want with minimal to no sludge (although requires removal of the plastic ring for both of my Keurigs to fit). If you are picky with your coffee, I would recommend the one Keurig sells (even though it's more expensive). If you want a simple and quick cup of coffee, be more eco-friendly, or want to have a multiple amount of K-cups on hand to fill, I think this product will work great for you.",

I called the company to try to get a longer hose and water attachment but they said they don't have longer attachments and to try Home Depot or Lowe's… I was able to find another hose that connected to my current hose and it seals with a metal clap. However, I had to order the water attachment from Amazon. I measured to make sure I ordered the correct length… I wasn't happy with the screw part of the hose, but luckily I realized I didn't need that part! It pops off, and you'll be able to connect to the washers provided attachment which the piece provided should attach to one of the 7 sink attachments…<br />So, once I got it set up… it seems to work just fine! I've only done a few small loads but I'm happy with it and recommend it to anyone who needs one! I live in an apartment and it's not too loud. I hope this helps! I've attached a few pictures and a video to help you understand what I was talking about.",

    "text": "So, I came across this product and bought it based on the number of stars/reviews and features. The product looks gorgeous on the counter. I have the red/gray one.<br /><br />Looks are deceiving.<br /><br />Let me say that the buttons are very flimsy.  When pushing them I feel like it's gonna cave in.  You have the ability to select between the small or large ice, only the large is not large at all (see pic).  Its small…. And wet!! The ice doesn't come out like the way a freezer would make ice. Once the @9 min cycle is done it pauses and then dumps the little cubes.  I wish it had a bit more insulation to prevent the ice from being so wet.  It barely gets the drink cold(er). Ice melts way too fast. So what I ended up doing was transferring the cubes into our lower freezer.  I am the type of person that requires ice all the time in my drinks. And we have had problems with our fridge system with the ice maker and water dispenser.  4 times they repaired our fridge and it is only 4 years old.  Anyways, I wanted a product that would produce the right ice.  My parents have a portable and their ice is fantastic.  I had hoped this would have done the job.  This product is not what I expected it to be.  I guess this is where they say you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I am on the fence on whether to return it or throw it away.  Sounds silly, I know.  Perhaps opt for the return.  The ice maker is NOT that great.  I see many reviews where other customers are quite happy and then videos posted of issues where the product's internal components are really messed up. That scares me.  And how I missed all that when I researched this is just my stupidity.<br /><br />Only last thing… this product is NOT quiet.  Its very loud and scares my cats!! I guess in a weird way it will keep them off that counter at least! Lol",

Just one pair of thin Capri pants was too much for it. It would start to wash it and then it would quit and start beeping. Even T-shirts and underwear wouldn't wash most of the time without setting off the limit alarm. And then when you actually got something washed, and you tried to use the spin cycle, all the stuff would fly out of the spin basket. The basket needs a lid. It also needs to be bigger. I ended up wrapping rubber bands around it to keep the clothes in but that's kind of ridiculous at the price point for this item. Another annoyance is the fact that the lid won't stay on when you store it vertically. I don't know how difficult it would've been to make the lid snap into place, but that would've been a big help as it rattles a lot when the machine is working as well.

You will not be able to wash a pair of jeans in this. I washed one pair of thin Capri pants and I felt like that was pushing the envelope. But I can do a pair of undies and a T-shirt. I will say that it's probably better to go with one of the brands that has a spin cycle if the extra cost is in your budget. Because it does cut down on the drying time considerably. But if you don't care about that, save the money and go for this one.",

I installed them all with two screws first, to get them in place, then went back and added the other two screws and tightened everything. It was a little difficult with the angle of the legs and using the tool to tighten the screws. I decided to swap out the gold knobs that came with it for some crystal knobs (to match my decor). The drawers have ample space and the desk has great quality. I would have given it 5 stars but the top of the desk scuff easily. The scuffs do come off if you wipe it, but I dont like that it does that. Overall highly recommend.",

I do love the nugget ice and this is pretty fast getting started. It does a good job producing ice and the ice tastes good. The machine was easy to set up (I didn't read the instructions -- just plugged it in and filled it up). After a couple of cleaning cycles, it started making ice. I like the ice. I can live with the speed - it's not superfast but it's fast enough for us. Cleaning cycle is easy. I wish it had a bigger basket so we'd have more ice at a time but that's not a deal breaker and I really, really wish we could hook to a water supply without having to hire a plumber to come in an replumb the entire place but those are things I'll live with. All in all, while it's a bit pricey, the size is a bit larger than I love and it's heavier than I wish it was, it does a good job and makes good ice. Very reliable.",

I like the cube size option in this but have ended up settling for the large cubes. They are soft enough that they get my drinks cold. I do like that I can have alexa turn it on in the morning so I have a full bin of ice when I get up. The filling and emptying are both easy which is super nice and the slim profile allows it to fit right into the small space that I have for it on my counter, right next to the sink (easy fill, easy empty). Not too much noise. I actually like that as the ice melts it is recycled to make more ice and doesn't tend to clump up.",

The ice is good, I love the nuggets and having the attached water reservoir is a real plus. Also the thing looks great and it's easy to put a glass underneath, press a button and you get ice. On the other hand, the water reservoir is hard to refill, I need to get out a funnel and fill it with that. The machine frequently goes into 'defrost' mode, especially when you want ice. The ice doesn't start that quickly so you have to plan ahead (maybe 10-15 minutes) and then have to hope that it won't go into defrost mode for no reason at all. I've left it off for a couple of days and it still defrosts. I followed all the tips and hints and there should be no issues but I am finally putting it away and replacing it with something that's easier to use.

    "text": "I have had this dish rack for the last 8 years and it has endured the trials of drying LOTS of dishes for my family of 11. Gradually, some of the kids have grown up and moved out, but this dish rack continues to do the job for the 2 that are still home, my husband, and myself. One piece of plastic that divides the dishes is now broken and the most vigorous scrubbing no longer gets it clean, so I was more than a little excited when my husband suggested that we finally retire the old one. Surely there must be some major advances in dish rack technology over the last decade, I thought. But no. After spending way too much time researching what is on the market, it appears that this model remains the best choice for people who need large dish racks with lots of flexibility in how it can be loaded. Ratings for other brands were significantly lower even for models five times the price and from well known kitchen product manufacturers. So, I will be sticking with the tried and true, although this decade I will going with the red to match my cherry Le Creuset pans and KitchenAid small appliances. Maybe I will have to consider designing a functional large dish rack myself because there is clearly a market.",

    "text": "We have had to buy our own ice for a while now.  It was not too bad of a problem, but when things are closed around a lot, we began to wish we had an ice maker.  Our refrigerator did not have the capacity for making ice and ice trays took up too much room and got tipped over too easily from careless kids.  This, however, has changed all of that.<br /><br />SIZE<br />The size of this unit is perfect if you want to have an ice maker but you don't have a lot of room.  You will have to be sure to have clearance around it, however, as it won't fit in a tight space.  It needs room for air to vent on the back and side.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />In the photos I posted, I put a bottle of Pelligrino next to this unit so you can see how big it is.  That is the larger Pelligrino glass bottle, not the small plastic ones.<br /><br />ICE<br />The ice that is made from this can be smaller or larger.  I picked the larger ones which also fit in most of our water bottles- a BIG plus.  Smaller ones will fit in smaller bottle openings if you happen to have them.<br /><br />WARNING<br />After reading through the instructions, I want to mention that you will want to probably use DISTILLED water for making ice in this.  We have high lime content and in the past machines that recommend being cautious of lime build up even got build up that was hard to clean using our water FILTERED.<br /><br />I have a few machines we have used distilled for and they have never had issues.  We are using distilled with this as well.<br /><br />DOES IT KEEP ICE COLD?<br />This keeps ice cold until you use it.  It will make ice until it is full and then stop.  Once it needs to be filled it will tell you that too.<br /><br />QUIET?<br />This is very quiet compared to others I have heard.<br /><br />IS IT FAST?<br />We got ice from this in about 7 minutes but it was only enough for one large glass.  To get a larger load it took about an hour.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a fantastic little ice machine.  The family is happy to have ice and not have to buy bagged ice and cram it in the storage freezer downstairs.  As long as we use distilled water, I hope to not have any long range problems.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />Make sure to read instructions thoroughly as if you plan to not use this all of the time, you have to go through certain steps prior to storing it.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS so far.  This is a big hit this summer.  I am really happy to have this.  It has made it so much easier to have our own ice when we want instead of realizing it is gone and have to go to the store when someone uses it up and says nothing.",

I even used a few different metal filters.  This fixes that.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a combination of a cap that has a pressure sensitive silicone release valve set into the middle of a solid bottom and a metal fine screen.  You screw it onto the Aeropress instead of the usual cover.<br /><br />COMES WITH EXTRA VALVE<br />This even came with an extra valve in it so you can replace it if you need to in the future.  I hope it won't be necessary for a long time though.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT PERFORM?<br />When I first used this, I was not sure what to expect.  I was able to put the right amount of coffee into the tube, put the right amount of water, and the BAM- it stayed put!<br /><br />Once I waited long enough, I pressed the plunger and it was amazing- the coffee came out nice and strong- in fact PERFECT.  Even my fussy daughter liked it.<br /><br />THE ONLY PROBLEM<br />The only problem if you want to call it that is that you won't get those perfect little pucks of pressed coffee grounds to pop into the compost.  It still comes out, but not as compacted.  No big deal, just thought you might want to know.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />A PERFECT addition to my Aeropress, this little beauty makes great coffee even better.  It keeps the grounds in the water just long enough to make a truly good cup of coffee.  I love how it works, and even don't mind losing the satisfaction of popping little pucks of coffee into the compost.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this ingenious invention.

The problem is that some of the containers are rejected, so I wanted one that wouldn't be.  Well, glad this came with two.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />This comes with a black and a purple version.  The cap opens up and you put the coffee in.  You put it in the Keurig and use it, and then normal use would cause it to work.  In my case.. *sighs*<br /><br />WATCH WHAT YOU ARE DOING!<br />My daughter grabbed the one container I had with me and ran off to make her coffee.  She had it in a bag, poured it in and then proceeded to slam the container into the unit, not realizing that you have to put it in ONE DIRECTION ONLY.  IF YOU DON'T DO THAT IT WILL POKE A HOLE IN THE UNIT.  That is precisely what happened to ours.<br /><br />DOES THE OTHER ONE WORK?<br />The other one works as long as the person using it lines up the correct direction BEFORE trying to use it.  IT seemed to perform well and the machine did not reject it.  So, now I only have one, which is why I wanted two- they could ruin one and mine would stay intact.<br /><br />CLEAN UP<br />Clean up is good .

    "text": "I remember reading a story about a rather simple person who was making conversation with someone in a waiting room.  She asked the man next to her what he did for a living and he responded , \"I  work in an egg factory\".<br /><br />\"Oooohh what do you do there?\" she asked.<br /><br />\"I put the shells on the eggs,\" he replied with a straight face.<br /><br />\"That is a respectable job,\" was her reply.<br /><br />It is those type of eggs that this holder was made for, apparently.  Let me explain..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This box is great in theory.  It has a firm construction to it.  It is sturdy, and well made.  It has a lid that fits tightly together, and it locks shut so that you can use it flat or stand it on its side.  There is a slide on the top which goes from 1 to 30 so that you can mark how many days before you should replace your eggs, assuming you use them up within 30 days.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?<br />The problem with this is that hardly any eggs fit into it.  The base where the bottom of the eggs sit is flexible somewhat, but the top is so shallow that it will not shut unless you have the perfectly small egg in it.  It might fit medium if they are just so, but that is all.  Most of our eggs will not fit in this.  We use eggs from chickens at a local farm.<br /><br />DOES IT WORK?<br />Once we culled out most of our eggs (thankfully we have quite a few) and found only those that fit in here, we were liking the ability to stand this case on its side for saving room in the refrigerator.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you have eggs that are small or smaller than usual, this might work for you.  If you have eggs from a farm that are more variable in size, move on to something else.  It is great in theory, but not in practice.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />This gets 3 out of five stars.  It is just too fussy to have to cull through our eggs just to make some fit in here.  I have found it useful to use the small ones for hard boiled eggs to store in here therefore making it more useful, but that is it.  It is just not as useful as we would have hoped.",

    "text": "My family has a little coffee shop in our home.  We love to make different styles and types of coffee with a variety of methods.  We will do pour over, cold brew, and varieties of other styles of coffee which are not always mainstream.  One thing that we love to do is make frothy milk (including non-dairy) to go with it.  Let's see how this measures up.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS FROTHING JUG LIKE?<br />This is a HIGH quality jug.  It is made from thick stainless steel.  It has a wider bottom and narrower top to allow for frothing without splashing of smaller amounts of milk.  The handle is not connected at the bottom, allowing for non-transfer of heat like handles which have the bottom attached.<br /><br />CAN YOU HEAT UP MILK IN THIS?<br />Although you CAN heat up milk in this jug, it is not a thick bottom, so you have to be careful if you decide to try this.<br />If you have a very small burner and can warm it up slowly, it can be done.  Do I recommend using it on a stove?  I think it is too small unless you have a tiny burner available.<br /><br />HOW MUCH DOES THIS HOLD?<br />Technically, this jug holds about a cup and a half of liquid.  If you really want to froth milk, I would not go above 1/2 cup of milk.<br /><br />COUNTRY OF ORIGIN?<br />Italy<br /><br />HOW WELL DOES THIS WORK?<br />I have a frother which works best with more milk, but sometimes I just want a personal size of foamy milk.  This is what this is good for.  When using about 1/3 cup of milk, this will work fairly well.  It is not quite as big allowing for as much air as my other frothers, but it does work.<br /><br />DOES THIS WORK WITH THE NINJA INTELLIGENT COFFEE/TEA MACHINE?<br />This works nicely with the frother on the side of the Ninja coffee/tea machine.  You have to hold it up, press the button, or put something under it to hold it high enough, but it works.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a single or small dual serving of frothy milk, this jug is helpful.  It works decently with a hand frother, Ninja frother, and small steamer/frothers if you have one of those.  You can warm up with this on a small burner, but use caution as the bottom is not double thick.  This is EXCELLENT quality stainless steel.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Four stars.  I find that it takes longer to get a good foam in this jug than it does in a few other larger containers, but it still works.  If the bottom section was a bit larger (more bulbous) it might work a bit better.  This rating is more like FOUR AND A HALF stars, but I can only do whole stars, hence the four star rating.  This is made from beautiful polished stainless.",

I am still open to trying new ones, and this was a decent contender.  Let's see how it works.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS FROTHER LIKE?<br />This frother has a cheap plastic base.  It feels lightweight and cheap.  It has a side switch on it and the whip is heavy duty compared to some that I have tried which are not as nice.  There are two AA batteries required to run this and a very lightweight cover on the bottom is easily knocked out of place.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This frother works well.  It does whip nicely but it has a bit of play in the way it spins.  The handle is harder to hold and feels very cheap.  I do not think it performs as nicely as the Cafe Casa that I have, but because I have to make my own coffee sometimes at some places (diet restrictions) I tend to like to have one I can bring with me when I go.  This is a decent one for that if put in a box that will protect it.<br /><br />ONE PROBLEM<br />One thing I do not like about this is the bottom.  It is more rounded and not flat.  That means that it rocks when I stand it upright and easily falls over.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a less expensive frother that is lightweight and spins well, this is a decent choice.  It has a few improvements that would make me like it better, but it is decent.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Three stars.  This just is not as solid or nice as Cafe Casa is.

    "text": "My daughter and grandson loves the taste of the water that they get through the filter, the filter is very easy to install, as for the price it is on the high side. I payed $38.95 for one filter and I brought two which came to $83.04. But they authentic and genuine replacement filters, you can order them on automatic refill every six month, but I don't think that will save you much. If you go back to where you brought your refrigerator they will charge you $50.00 per filter.",

The spin dryer does an amazing job and is pretty quiet once the spinner gets going. I was not about to haul this thing atop some makeshift platform in order to make the gravity drain work, and I certainly wasn't going to carry pots of drain water to dump into the sink - I simply kept the drain hose in an upright position attaching it to the provided clip on the side of the washer and then slipped a smaller hose down inside the main drain hose - the other end of the smaller hose is attached to a small little pump I bought at my local home improvement store and drains into the kitchen sink. To drain the water I simply switched the washer to the 'Drain' setting and flipped the switch on the pump. Easy as pie. I did the same when running the spin dryer.<br />I do have a couple of complaints....<br />1. The washer arrived very, very dirty, especially the bottom - there was gross brown crud all over the bottom.<br />2. There was a number scratches and deep gouges on the outside.<br />3. The provided hose to fill is worthless - I simply attached a small hose used for normal full sized washing machines to my kitchen sink spigot and filled the washer that way - super easy and fast.<br /><br />It definitely cannot handle adult sized bedding, and I have my doubts that it can handle even one pair of jeans - not because of power, because it's pretty powerful, but I say this due to it's size - it's crazy small inside. But it's great for very small loads....a couple of shirts, with some socks, undies, etc..",

I wondered if I needed to replace this button panel, or the circuit board it attaches to.  I ordered this based on some internet research and the reviews indicating a solution to similar symptoms.<br /><br />The item arrived and I quickly slipped the ribbon cable into the connector on the circuit board without removing the old panel.  This test proved it would resolve the problem.  I proceeded to replace the control panel in position.  The only tools needed are a T-20 Torx driver, and a 1/4 hex-head capscrew driver (or 1/4 inch socket).  Be sure to unplug the dishwasher since removing the circuit board cover exposes some 120V connectors that are not hard to short with a tool or your hand, hence the warning sticker on the cover.<br /><br />I really have no complaints.  The first panel lasted 10 years, which is somewhat fair considering how things are made relatively disposable these days.  I didn't give it five stars only because I can't get too excited about a replacement part that doesn't upgrade anything.",

    "text": "This is a polyphosphate cartridge.  Practically, it cannot \"filter\" the scale-causing minerals from the water, as there is far too much volume of minerals to hold in the tiny cartridge.  Instead, the cartridge releases a small amount of polyphosphates into the water.  Those chemicals inhibit the formation of the scale -- in simple terms, they keep the minerals suspended in the water and inhibit them from forming the white deposits.  Of course, the minerals have to go somewhere, and they can't stay suspended indefinitely as they won't evaporate as steam.  Some of the mineral material inevitably forms scale, while the rest is flushed out of the humidifier tank in the flush cycle (which is frequently problematic on the troublesome TrueSteam humidifiers).  So the polyphosphates released by this cartridge help to inhibit scale by keeping the minerals suspended until they get flushed.<br /><br />Now that you understand how it works, you can go get a standard 1/4\" quick-connect, in-line polyphosphate scale-inhibiting filter that's twice the size for half the price.  Either way, you can only expect it to last about 6 months.  The polyphosphates used in these filters are \"food grade\" and considered acceptable for whole-house use, including drinking water (although there's no benefit for drinking).  Polyphosphates are sometimes used in lieu of water softeners.",

But this adjustable dolly is not of high quality, it does gets the job done though,  So I guess I'll call it a decent purchase.<br /><br />Takeaway: It's good to transport small appliance around, maybe furniture too, but don't rely on it for something heavy, I would say nothing heavier than 300lbs, I understand the weight capacity on this dolly is over 2000lbs on this, that number is highly inflated, I have this in my closet, this would break in half if you out over even 1000 pounds on it<br /><br />Hope this helps",

This causes the food to become mixed with the water, and get pumped through the pump and back through the spray arms.  Things like Rice and Stickers off of new cups and you name it clog up the arms, EXPECIALLY this center arm.  My dishwasher has a lower spinning arm on the bottom of the tub, this one attaches to the underside of the top rack, and then there is the top arm at the top of the dishwasher which is pretty useless.  I have taken the arms off at least 50 times and cleaned them by hand in the tub, soaking in vinegar, using pipe cleaners and wire to clear them out.  I finally gave up when something got caught inside that I couldn't dislodge.  THIS WORKED LIKE A CHARM.  However, here is something IMPORTANT FOR ALL TO READ.  When you take off the arm under the top rack - KEEP THE SCREW AND WASHER THAT COME OUT.  This arm does not have a new replacement screw or washer, and you'll need that to reinstall new arm.  This is not a defect or anything - It is just good information to have before you throw out the screw and washer and then have to go digging through the garbage to find it again, clean it and be able to put the new arm on.  Also - the part number from GE and the part number for this arm (and pretty much all other arms for dishwashers) do not match.  I simply eyeballed the picture and it looked identical and took a chance.  It is identical.  Works great.  Wife is happy.  I'll probably end up buying another to pre-plan for the next clog that occurs when my family decides to put a bowl full of rice into the dishwasher without rinsing it out first.",

    "text": "My LG front loader with the control panel on top of the dryer, near the back - started making a huge racket.  It then would get stuck and to start it you would have to open the door and roll the drum around and try again.  I read online that these were the ones you needed.  NOTE:  These are only the wheels, not the posts or washers or little triangle plastic things that hold the rollers in place - and only ONE wheel per order, not two.  I bought four, and took my dryer apart.  I unplugged the unit, popped the top open from the front - there are two latches you have to open with a putty knife near each side.  Then I just took off the screws on top, took the screws off the door panel (Kept the door on), then popped and lifted the front door panel off.  Then unscrewed 2 screws to take the metal thingy off where the air goes after it goes through your lint filter in the door, then 4 screws to take the front of the drum holder off.  Then you reach under the drum, hold back the pulley tension wheel and the belt comes loose.  You use the belt to lift the drum out.  There are two rollers in back and two on the inside of the front panel that you took off.  I kept the posts as they were fine.  One of the plastic holding clips was missing, and one wheel had broken the inside hole wide open.  You carefully pull the plastic triangle holding clip off (they break sometimes) - if you break them, I used what I believe was called a 9/16 &#34;E&#34; clip you can get at any hardware store.  They also sell this wheel in a version on Amazon that comes with the posts and clips completely.  I only replaced the front two rollers, as the ones in back were fine.  I cleaned the dryer out with a vaccum and then reassembled it all.  Took about 2 hours including a trip to the hardware store.  One guy online said to use a 1/2 inch &#34;E&#34; clip, but it didn't look like it was big enough.  I could get the 1/2 on, but the 9/16ths seemed to fit better.  I ordered 4 of these, but only used two.  No worries, I have two backups now and I fixed my dryer for under $50 instead of buying a new $800 dryer.  Thanks!  Worked great.  These were pictured blue when I bought them - the ones inside the dryer are blue - these were delivered gray, but they fit perfectly.  Dryer runs quiet again!  No more THUMP THUMP THUMP!",

I didn't expect this but it is my favorite feature.  I made them the day before and usually they make my fridge smell eggy when I cover them with tin foil.  This seals it completely so there's no odor at all.  The little egg shaped divots cradle the eggs so they don't slide around and get broken.  I was even able to do the fancy swirly designs with the filling without having to worry about them getting smashed.",

    "text": "Part Trader - Fast Shipping (FEDEX!!) and easy purchase of course. The part fit and now my washer sounds better than new.<br /><br />The part - The rotor assembly appears to be redesigned. The original part, looking at the &#34;gear&#34; or teeth, was both white plastic and some kind of black material. It was stripped out, so the rotor would spin without the tub. It took over 5 years for this to happen. As such, I even ran out of our extended warrantee. (Good Job LG - Sarcasm) It would appear this is meant to happen and is a sacrificial part of the rotor, for two reasons. 1) To prevent motor burnout I guess. The motor has a 10 year warrantee. 2) To make a few extra bucks. Sure they could sell a piece of plastic, but no they have to include the magnets and half of what makes up a motor. I digress. The new part, made, May 5th 2015, is &#34;brand new&#34; The entire gear teeth is made out of this black material, about an 1/8th inch all around. Significantly more than what was on the original component. Therefore I hope this is a permanent fix.<br /><br />Conclusion - LG offered a 10 year warranty on the direct drive motor. However In all my motor experience, the rotor should be included in this warranty. Regardless, the cost of the part, and ease of repair, it is still cheaper than messing with the warranty. According to our repair guy, over the phone, he suggested the cost would be around $140 for the repair, which included an $80 diagnostic, applied to the final bill - if under warranty. Fair is fair, he needs a job, but not while I can do it. I feel duped, from the standpoint that LG engineered the washer this way. If they sold the plastic part for $6, by itself, I would sing praises to them. But, no, they didn't do it. The MSRP of the part is $100, and we are getting it for little more than half that. Which means the repair guy should charge about $300 for parts and labor.<br /><br />It's not a $300 job, if you ask me. It's easier than changing a tire.",

That is, until things starting malfunctioning and breaking down. The ice maker kept spilling over, the fill bar popping out, and ice jamming the drawer. Then the ice maker started spraying water inside the freezer which again froze over some food and jammed the door. We fixed it, but more problems came. The ice seemed to be shrinking and taking a long time to make. Frost seemed to be coming and going, the ice cream was either soft of crystallized. And then we discovered water leaking out from under the fridge which damaged our kitchen floor. I called LG and got the number for an authorized service tech who came out and told the sealed system was leaking and would need to be replaced. The good news, the sealed system (compressor, evaporator and condenser) were still under warranty. The bad news, it was still going to end up costing me $700 to repair the fridge. An internet search turned up hundreds of customer complaints about this and other LG fridges, same problems as I've had, plus interior light sets causing the plastic interior to melt and sometimes catch on FIRE. Most reports were that LG refused to take care of the problems. I loved this fridge, but I can't afford to keep a $1400 box that doesn't keep my food at a safe temperature.",

    "text": "I purchased this dishwasher part directly from Amazon, not one of the third party vendors who offer it for a lower price. What I received is a genuine Whirlpool part in a sealed plastic bag that says it was made in the US. The part has a different number and a sticker that says it was made in Mexico. None of this matters to me because the part is correct, intact and it is a perfect fit for my Maytag Quiet Series 200 dishwasher.<br /><br />If you are repairing your dishwasher latch and handle assembly, be sure this is the correct part. My original was white, but it's now only manufactured with a black handle. Assure that the power is cut to your dishwasher to avoid electrocution. Have your torx t20 bit in a driver or screwdriver because you need it to remove the 11 screws holding the interior door to the exterior door. The two screws at the center of the upper edge hold this piece in place, so they should be the last two you remove and the first two you secure upon completion. The entire process from start to finish took about 10 minutes, including the time it took to identify the circuit to cut.",

When my supply of the Chemex Bonded Unbleached Pre-folded Square Coffee Filters was depleting, I purchased a reusable hemp filter, thinking that a difference would not be noticeable.  I was so wrong. These bonded paper filters, when moistened with water before filling with freshly ground coffee, produce a coffee that displays the coffee essence without residual solids or added bitterness from the fabric or paper.  The folded square design allows the user to simply pull one free corner to turn a square into a cone that allows for perfect filtering of the hot water as it's gently poured into the coffee carafe.  By slowly adding the water, you can control the drip and my preference is to pour around the outer edge instead of directly into the center of the filter.  In all these years, I have never had a Chemex filter break or slip through and into the carafe, as I've had occur with the hemp filter.  I also like the Chemex round filters and have just ordered a package, so I'll review those once I recall how they compare for me.  I purchased a case of these pre-folded squares some time ago, so I don't remember my impression of the other filters.  If you care about the taste of your coffee, then I absolutely recommend using these with your Chemex.",

Once it's installed, this is easy to operate and performs as required, freezing water and extruding little crescent shaped cups of ice into a plastic bucket which is included.  Also included is the plastic water hose and a plastic scooper, all are white.  The ice maker is black with a stainless steel front door and it's interior is white.  The on/off switch as at the bottom of the appliance and it's very easy to depress.  If you need an ice maker and are prepared to defrost this every four to six weeks, it seems to be a good product.  I wasn't impressed with the thin door seal or amount of ice contained in the tray, but it's acceptable.  There is a warning in the literature that this appliance can be loud and I would have to agree.  It's quieter if your ice tray is full because the machine stops producing ice.  You can also stop it as desired by simply lifting the wire until you're ready to make more.  This ice maker is about the size of a dorm refrigerator and it's a great option for a basement bar type situation or health care need.",

    "text": "The Melitta Tea Filters, 40-Count (Pack of 6) is a wonderful way to create tea bags, spice bags, bath salt bags, or whatever you can think of for a secure and economical system.  I generally place loose tea leaves with herbs and spices inside an unbleached bag, then put it into a teapot.  After adding hot water and waiting for the prescribed time period, I easily remove the bag and have a pot of tea with a minimal amount of residue in the brew.  Because a filled bag will remain open, I've also created some gifts by attaching a cotton string and little hand decorated tag to the bags.  For the unsealed bag, be careful that the longer end does not hang over the edge of a cup, mug or teapot too much or you'll run the risk of the hot water being absorbed all the way to the upper edge, saturating it and possibly dripping onto the table top.  This happened to me once because I forgot to retrieve the bag and the teapot sat for about a half hour.  The bags can also be used for mulling spices because they are rather large.  I love them!",

    "text": "I have a Kenmore dryer that is about 10 years old made by LG.  Two years ago it really needed repair.  When I took it apart, one of the rollers had been completely worn down.  I bought the parts contained in this kit separately, and paid a lot more than this kit.<br /><br />Two years later, the dryer was making noise.  I decided to take it apart and check it out.  This kit is so cheap, I figured if I was going to do the work, I may as well have what I need to fix it.  I found that even after two years there was a dangerous amount of hair and dust in the dryer.  That alone made it worthwhile to take apart the dryer.<br /><br />The two front rollers had lots of hair and didn't roll easily.  The back ones were OK, but still had some hair and were not totally easy to roll.  But to my surprise the idler pulley did not roll well.  I should have left the original as the replacement I guess was crap.<br /><br />It takes about an hour for me to take apart the dryer and replace these parts.  Now that I have done it a couple times I am more familiar with the job.  Thank God for You Tube because they will explain how to do it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  It is best to take apart your dryer and clean it out every couple years.  (What I saw today looked like it could easily start a fire.) Once you get in there, you are likely to find problems with rollers  or possibly the idler pulley, especially if your dryer is making noise.  If you have a part that it totally working perfectly, don't replace it especially if it originally came with your dryer.  Aftermarket parts can be low quality like the idler pulley that I bought last time.",

I make hot tea with fresh mint leaves, fresh grated ginger, fennel seeds, etc.  I wanted something that kept my ingredients out of my drinking tea but infused them with the flavor.  I also wanted something that was easy to clean.  These fit the bill perfectly!  The company actually reached out to me and recommend I try these since I didn't completely love their other product.  How awesome is that?  It's nice to know that The Friendly Swede cares about their customers and want you to be happy with their products and provide personalized recommendations.<br /><br />These mesh tea infusers are easy to use and seal up well with the ingredients.  They have a small clasp on the side that slides in and closes the two halves together.  This also makes it easy to clean since the entire thing opens up when you are done and I never have to worry about grated ginger or small fennel seeds getting stuck in there.  These also have a hook at the end so you can place it on the tip of your cup so when you are ready to remove the infuser, you don't have to dig it out.  Simply unhook it from your cup and remove it.<br /><br />I am so happy with these and have been using them daily since I received them.  That in addition to the follow-up from the company have made me a happy customer.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again or other products from them.",

The flames shot up from the jets about a foot and a half high and almost burning my face & eyebrows! i never expected this from a quality stove like trangia so i ordered this Esbit alcohol stove as an immediate replacement. It functioned just like the Trangia but in a slow constant flame and the flame lasted almost half an hour because i filled this stove with yellow HEET fuel up to the brim. It actually cooked 4 pieces of thick bacon, a big whole piece of Polish sausage, fried 3 scrambled eggs to a slight burn and on top of this it also boiled a liter of water to a full rolling boil! all this cooking in a half hour and one single fill of fuel! i don't know if i'm ever going back in sing a trangia mini burner again knowing that this stove is actually more fuel efficient and burns even and constant....i think i'll stick to this stove for the time being and I might order another in the near future.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:1b1b9e0883a865bc6e2a22a029b6fd31]] This is a great compact, portable, and affordable ice maker. Originally purchased this because the built-in ice maker in the fridge at home stopped working and we don't have much room in the freezer for ice trays. It would've cost way too much to repair the fridge's ice maker, so we shopped around and purchased this Silonn countertop ice maker machine. This brand has two sizes. We purchased the 12 x 9 x 12 inch model. My family and I have been using this machine for over a week and so far it has exceeded our expectations. It doesn't make much noise while operating and the main noise comes from when a new batch of ice is complete and dropped in the tray. The ice cubes made are bullet shaped and you can choose between large and small size ice cubes. It takes approximately 8 minutes for a set of 9 ice cubes to be made. I poured a little over 32 fl. oz. of water into the water reservoir and it looks like it can fit another 8 fl. oz. or so before it reaches the max fill line. In my initial test the machine filled the ice tray with ice and had about 16 fl oz. of water left in the reservoir. The user manual states the water reservoir capacity is 1.5L<br /><br />Pros of this machine:<br /> - portable<br /> - compact<br /> - its easy to use.<br /> - the power cord is long.<br /> - comes with an ice tray/basket, ice scoop, power cable, drain plug.<br /> - can make 2 different sizes of bullet shaped ice cubes.<br /> - minimal noise while operating.<br /> - has a drain plug to easily drain the excesss water left in the water reservoir of the machine.<br /> - has a transparent lid, which makes it easy to view how much ice is inside the tray/basket.<br /> - has a \"self cleaning\" feature. When the self cleaning mode is activated the pump will start to pump water and keep running for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the machine will go back to standby mode and you'll need to manually open the drain plug to remove the water.<br /> - has physical buttons at the top of the machine to quickly change settings.<br /> - has a sensor that alerts you if the machine needs more water to make ice. There is an indicator at the top of the machine will lights up if this happens.<br /> - has a sensor that alerts you if the ice tray/basket is full and temporarily stops making ice. When there is room again the machine automatically starts making ice. here is an indicator at the top of the machine wil light up if this happens.<br /><br />Cons of this machine:<br /> - the handle feels flimsy and is made of plastic. I don't trust carrying the machine by just holding the handle. It really feels like it cannot hold the 15 lb machine for very long.<br /><br />This ice maker machine supposedly makes 27 lbs of ice per 24 hours, which is way more than I'll ever need. It also states in the product page that with each product sold they donte to water.org Although it doesn't states how much they donate to them with each product sold, but still a nice gesture.<br /><br />I've included a short video of the machine in action when it is the noisiest and photos of the machine itself. There is a photo with me holding the ice scoop, which has two ice cubes in the scoop to compare the large size ice cube (on the left side of the photo) vs the small size ice cube (on the right side of the photo). Hope this review helps my fellow Amazon shoppers.",

For me, it'd  be good if they made the velco part wider so there would be an option to trim the width of them.

This kit is okay for holding a pod and filling it, but the issue comes from the foil lid. I have tried many brands and this one is no different. The adhesives all fail when they get hot, and the grinds leak out. This is one of the worse ones I have tested, leaking around the entire seal. The stand itself is a little undersized too. The pods don't sit flush and when you push down to seal the foil, you can feel the pod flexing in. It doesn't damage the pod, but just seems poorly sized. Overall, I cannot recommend this product.",

Price difference at the time.  2.  Availability.  3. Your storage preference.  For me, these would be easier to store than the Chemex square boxes.

    "text": "If you are looking to invest in a great ice maker this is an excellent option. This portable ice maker is about the size of my breadmaker and sits easily on the end of my kitchen counter. You have to make sure the air outlet is 8-10 inches away from the nearest wall or object. This is easy to do if you place this on the end of a counter.<br /><br />What I like about this particular ice maker is that you can watch the entire process of ice making through a see-through window. What happens is the ice is made in a little tray. The water is put under the ice basket and is sucked up into the ice tray. The ice forms around metal and is then released into the ice basket with a little mechanical shovel.<br /><br />To fill up the ice basket it takes 77 minutes so one hour and seventeen minutes later you have three large glasses of ice. Once you empty the basket it will then continue to create ice for another fifty six minutes. So to make a gallon bag of ice takes 133 minutes and uses up a little less than two quarts of water. This is actually a lot faster than most freezers produce ice.<br /><br />I personally like the large sized ice but there is an option for smaller ice too. I noticed that the ice this initially makes tends to be smaller than the ice made a little later. So each time the water is colder and produces bigger ice cubes (well they really look like little hollow thimbles).<br /><br />Setup is easy once you've read the directions. You simply fill with water and push the start button. Then each batch of ice takes about seven minutes to make. You can use tap water, filtered water or bottled water. Whatever you prefer. The taste of the ice will change with each option. I made some ice with tap water and it tasted OK in a drink.<br /><br />What you don't want to do is use this to make ice ahead of time. If you put the slightly wet ice cubes in the freezer they do tend to freeze together. It is best to use this as a source of ice that you are going to use on a consistent basis like at a small party where ice is needed for an extended period of time. Remember you are going to get about three large glasses of ice per hour. You can however remove ice for smaller glasses at any time. The hinged lid opens easily and does not restrict taking ice out even if the ice maker is in operation. I would however recommend caution as this does have moving parts. You want to keep your hands only on the ice scoop and take ice directly out of the basket.<br /><br />So my only real caution would be that this ice maker should be kept away from children. It is not a toy! Even if it feels like it is.<br /><br />One thing the directions don't state is what to do with the leftover water in the ice tray once the low water indicator comes on. I simply tilted the entire ice maker so the water ran down into the water container. Then I drained out the water leftover by removing the plug while sitting the ice maker over the sink. It was pretty easy. If you were making ice for a party then you would have to refill the water quite a few times over a period of hours. You have to refill the water approximately every 133 minutes. The ice maker will stop once the basket is full. The minute you remove the ice it starts making it again. You could keep extra ice in an ice bucket.<br /><br />I found this ice maker great fun to use and I loved the shapes of the ice. I made myself some ice tea with the first batch of ice and it was great. I can see myself using this a lot in the summer although this ice maker is not for outside use. You should also keep it out of direct sunlight as that will cause the infared sensor to malfunction. Also this does make a little sound mostly like a fan running. It is fairly quiet. The loudest noise you will hear is when the ice drops and is put into the basket.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one ice maker free for review. This review is my honest opinion.",

The inside of the dripper feels smooth and I thought there was a piece of smooth plastic or something I needed to remove, but it's supposed to be that smooth. I put in coffee grounds, use my gooseneck kettle and pour over the middle slowly. Makes a great cup, of course it's not as slow as a drip coffee maker so you will get a little sediment in the bottom of your cup, but I'm use to that with any metal dripper. This is not for using with a paper filter, get a ceramic (3 hole) dripper for that. This cleaned up a lot easier than others, maybe because the inside is smooth? Rinses out no problem. This also sits really well on different cup sizes, and the bottom plate is removeable. Very happy with this one.",

This one requires watching. I did a &#34;taste test&#34; of this pitcher and the Brita and found no difference. It looks like the replacement filters for this are pretty pricey, and not sure of how available. Perhaps the funnel that can be used in other containers makes it worthwhile. It is attractive, nice design.",

Except when the load is out of balance in the spin basket. I can barely hear the machine when I'm in the next room. I'm super careful with what I use in this machine since it's mostly plastic. Instead of bleach (corrosive to plastic) I use baking soda and vinegar instead. My laundry smells beautiful and it's clean. The machine does so well at spinning out all excess water that my clothes are almost dry when they come out.  No Assembly needed and it's super easy to use. I've washed towels jeans size 14 and even a light weight cotton blanket twin size and each one with ease! The spin basket works better than the regular commercial washer offered by my apartment complex. Also the towels I wash are not bath sheets. So I'm careful to not overload the machine. I give this 4 stars so far for ease of use and convenience, size, and low noise level. It seems like it's made well. It is mostly plastic but I think that is a  good thing because it's light and easy to move, and it won't rust. I'm hoping this will last for awhile.",

I determined it to be thermostat based on how cooling wouldn't start, but I could make it run by giving my fridge a whack right by the temp controls.  I found the part and instructions on how to replace it on the sears parts direct site.  Not wanting to pay almost $80 for the part if I didn't need to, I searched for the part number listed on Amazon and found this item for under $15 - that is a hefty price difference and since the reviews were generally good, I went ahead and purchased it.  It got to me in under 2 days and took about 15 minutes to install.<br /><br />I will say the insulating sleeve on it seems to be a little cheap (not even sure it is intended to be for insulating).  I tried to swap it for the original one,  but the end of the sensor is a little thicker then the original insulating sleeve will allow.  I assume this will mean that I need to set my fridge to be a little colder than I had before.<br /><br />Very happy with this replacement part for the price.<br /><br />Only time will tell how well this is manufactured, but at the price, getting 2 years use out of it will make it more than worth it considering that my fridge is only 9 years old.",

We tend to use this ice maker on the counter for all of our ice needs.
