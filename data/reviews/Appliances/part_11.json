Took a chance with guessing this part would solve the problem, but turns out the cold water valve had cracked and we needed this part to replace it. Really not hard to install at all. The hard part is taking the washer apart and remembering how to put it together. Just take pictures of before, during and after in case you forget or need to do it again. It's been two months and many many washes and it's still holding up. Trust this woman when she says anyone could buy this ans fix theirs themselves. Good luck!",

    "text": "I'm 9 Months into using these Reusable K-Cups and have had varying experiences along the way:<br /><br />For reference, I have a Kuerig 2.0<br /><br />I'm the only one who uses these at home, and I use the in pairs: two 6 oz shots, which I read was recommended and can confirm is better than 12 oz through one.<br /><br />The first two worked well in general.<br />On one (I'll refer to it as K-Cup #1), the lid broke pretty early: it was still usable, just less convenient.<br />The mesh started splitting on K-Cup #2 first, but it ended up lasting about as long as #1 (by which I mean that it leaked  very few grinds for a long time).<br />K-cup #3 replaced #2, and my Kuerig didn't want to recognize it immediately: it took several attempts each time to get it to pass.<br />I experimented with #3, trying to find a pattern: I would spin it to see if orientation mattered and closed the lit with varying speeds and force. Eventually I slammed it hard enough that a chip busted out of the rim surrounding where the needle goes: since then the K-Cup has worked perfectly.<br />The Kuerig also would not recognize K-Cup #4: I tried my previous method of slamming it at first, thinking that I'd prefer the needle clear what space it needed (and that I'm seriously getting fed up with Kuerigs at this point and am thinking of switching back to traditional brewing methods), but couldn't get the needle to chip this cup. So, I took a knife and carved out some of the plastic rim; the K-cup now works about 75% of the time, which is obviously less often than #3 but is acceptable.<br /><br />The other thing I have noticed is that the splitting is probably due to packing the K-Cup: at first I was stuffing grinds in there and forcing the lid closed; now I just pour the grinds in and brush the top so that the lid closes easily. This seems to improve the life span of the K-Cups somewhat.",

The ice no longer sticks together as before. One tip is to plug in the power before you screw in the the third lower screw mount, as it restricts the plug from insertion.<br /><br />Before replacing, test the water intake valve as described by the paper clip guy on Youtube. Instead of trusting your luck to the electric tape though, unplug the frig , insert the paper clip, and plug back in. If your freezer has water coming in at the port, your water valve is fine, and you need to buy this replacement. See link below. Another tip is to put a towel in the freezer to catch the water as the water will pump in as long as the paper clip is completing the circuit.<br /><br />[...]",

    "text": "I got this for my husband to use in his FrancisFrancis Y5 machine. This capsule fits perfectly and actually requires less torque to close the machine than the standard capsules.  Also, it can be used to make both shots and drip coffee. The only downside is that to get coffee that is the same quality as the standard illy capsules, you must tamp the coffee grounds correctly and there's a bit of a learning curve to that. If not packed tightly enough, the coffee will taste watered down; if packed too tight, you'll get less volume and it may taste a bit burnt. It's not difficult to do correctly, it just requires a little practice. Once you learn that technique, you can get espresso with perfect crema and full-bodied Italian cafe quality drip coffee. If you like to do multiple shots at a time, you'd be better off just using the standard disposable capsules (illy does have a great recycling program). But for single shots and single cups of drip coffee, this capsule is great once you learn how to tamp the grounds. My husband uses both, depending on the situation.",

After that, it works as advertised, and it makes a decent cup of coffee. However, I'm not so sure it is worth the 25-30 cents per serving that you save by not buying prepackaged coffee pods. First you have to grind the coffee beans. Even pre-ground coffee is often too coarse and will need to be ground again. Then there is the messy job of transferring the finely ground coffee into the filter, a task that can seldom be accomplished without spilling some. Afterwards there is the messy cleanup where you need to use a lot of running water to clean grounds out of the filter.  All in all, it's a time-consuming process. To me, the main purpose of getting a single serve coffee maker was as a time saver.",

The end-of-cycle signal sounds like a child's toy and is so feeble, even on its loudest setting, that you can't hear it unless you're in the same room and there is no other noise. Furthermore, when the cycle is done, the dryer just stops, rather than continuing to tumble so that the clothes won't wrinkle. There is  &#34;wrinkle care&#34; option that is supposed to keep the drum tumbling for a little while when the cycle is over, but it only turns the drum a quarter-turn once every minute, not enough to stop the wrinkles from setting in. Even worse, the &#34;wrinkle-care&#34; setting inexplicably disables the end-of-cycle signal completely. If you don't want to iron, you basically need to pull up a chair next to the dryer and sit there the whole time.<br /><br />The dryer also has a special cycle to take the wrinkles out of a dry garment using steam. It shoots steam into the drum alright, but also plenty of liquid water along with it. So when the cycle is over, your shirt will be wrinkle-free but will have one sopping wet sleeve, for example.<br /><br />It's pretty clear that LG doesn't have a clue about how laundry appliances are actually used. Avoid this brand.",

    "text": "They work perfectly in my K40.  I also purchased the Disposable Filters for Use in Keurig Brewers - Simple Cups - 100 Replacement Filters.  I've made coffee with and without the disposable filters and it worked perfectly both ways.  I like using the disposable filters because it's so much easier to clean up.  Just pull out the paper filter and you're done.  I didn't have the problems with the silt, although we don't use very finely ground coffee.  No leakage, no mess.  I also tried adding just a drop or two of organic hazelnut extract.  I can make my own flavored coffees now!  Different flavors for me and my husband without the cost of the K cups!  I am a happy coffee drinker.",

Just a simple design that was VERY WELL MADE..ACCURATE & PRECISE.<br />I looked at all the high end names, and read all the reviews. The icon seemed to be the best product for the money.<br />There were not allot of reviews for this particular item, and of the small number of reviews, some raved and some were dissatisfied. I was a bit stressed from the not so good reviews, but went ahead and bought this range.<br />I am a person who loves to cook, and bake.Â  I was hoping for precision, controlling the burners, and an oven that was consistent.<br />I am happy to report that this stove delivered.<br />I was prepared to have the gas air controls adjusted, (which would not be uncommon), but did not need to have anything adjusted.<br />The combination of the size and power of the burners works well for me, and they all have the ability to be adjusted precisely.<br />The oven is accurate and holds consistently.<br />After reading so many opinions, I have to admit that I don't understand how people go to some discount store, and grab an appliance because the price is low, (especially an appliance of this caliber),Â  and then expect miracles from it when there is no responsible customer-store relationship; no one who cares if the appliance was placed on the truck, and delivered with care, and respect; no one to call locally for help with any questions or problems that they may have.<br />I purchased my stove from a reputable family appliance store._(for as good a price as I had seen anywhere), Although I was happy with it right from the start, the store encouraged me to call with any questions, and assured me that if I needed any adjustments, they would promptly send an experienced service person.<br />This is a really nice unit for someone who enjoys cooking and appreciates simplicity._(I do not miss any of the useless electronics)<br />When the oven is holding at 450 degrees, the stove top, and controls remain cool to the touch. This tells me that the oven is well insulated. The weight of the stove and solid feel of the controls tells me that the stove was put together with care and integrity.<br />There is a learning curve with every new item.Â  No two stoves or ovens will work exactly the same. Just go with it. That is how you become proficient.<br />Yes I would recommend this stove to those who demand and appreciate the value of a well made tool.<br />SIX MONTHS LATER:<br />I am amazed at how pleased I am.<br />I look forward to using it everyday.<br />I love it's simplicity.. Not even a clock or timer. Just a great stove.<br />(MADE IN USA, some parts possibly from Mexico)",

I contacted them (with no clue what they would/could do about it; I was mostly curious) and got no response. The  oven does work however, and it looks fine. Possibly the most amazing flaw is that, here in 2020, an oven with electronic controls does NOT include a timed cooking option. The oven has a timer, but it's just a timer; it beeps. It's on you to remember to turn your oven off or change the temperature or whatever. I find it hard to understand why anybody would bother to manufacture an oven control \"brain\" like that.<br /><br />(edited) If you want to take advantage of the \"Fit Promise\" guarantee, it appears to be based on what the installer did to overcome the fit problem (whatever it might be). You'll need a photo of the previous oven while it was still installed, a picture of the empty alcove before the new oven is installed, and a picture of the newly-installed oven. You'll also need a receipt for whatever the installer did to overcome the fitting problem, which in my case was nothing so I get nothing. Also somehow I failed to take photos of the old oven and the empty alcove because of course I didn't.",

There are 15\" and 18\" compactor bags so make sure you get the right size.<br /><br />The unit cost per package of 15 at my Whirlpool store is $14.95. They offer no discount when buying a case of bags. Plus my states 8.75% tax equals $16.26 per package. Plus the cost of gas to get to the Whirlpool store.<br /><br />The Unit cost per package from Amazon is $10.68. (no gas used to get to the Whirlpool store when shipped from Amazon)<br /><br />Buying these bags from Amazon is a saving of over 33%.",

However still need to wring out the clothes by hand for faster drying on the line. All-in all, it is a great deal because most off-grid washers don't hold enough clothes to make it practical. With this one, it equals what I would put in a small load of an electric washer.

    "text": "My washer sits right in front of my cellar access door, so we need to move it on occasion, and the old 5 foot hoses made that difficult.  These solved the problem.<br /><br />By the way, if you're contemplating getting stainless steel jacketed hoses...I talked to a plumber about this.  He said the problem with the steel is that 99% of hoses fail at the coupling, and when you bend the hose at the coupling, the very steel that you think is keeping your hose from bursting is digging into the hose and promoting it's failure!  So never mind steel jacketsâjust get a good quality hose (like this), and get it a few feet longer than you think you need, so that when you move the washer, you're not bending and stressing the hose at the coupling....and remember to turn the water off, especially when you'll be gone for long periods.",

    "title": "I Love This Ice Machine A Latte",
    "text": "[[VIDEOID:d6498621e19ec53178ed5c11cf066c45]] Really pleased with this small countertop icemaker. Did a lot of research before buying--my small apt fridge doesn't make ice. This machine was recommended by Amazon and got good reviews. It came very well packaged and after I let it sit for 24 hours for the coolant to settle, it ran well from the first use. I use it approx once a week to make/bag enough ice for my morning iced latte. Obviously, it can make much much more. ð As promised, the machine makes a small batch about every 6-8 minutes. It doesn't keep the ice frozen once made but I've found I can wait til it makes at least 2-3 batches to scoop the cubes with minimal melting. I only use spring water in the machine. The ice cubes taste great. I've never noticed any off taste or odor. The only quirk I have noticed with the machine is if I let it sit for a few weeks without using it, when I use it again, it makes a wearing noise the first few times it takes up water but that goes away and it it runs pretty quietly. You can hear the fan running (like the low hum of a refrigerator) but it's easy to tune out and isn't loud enough to interrupt conversation or wake a baby. You can also hear the water running inside the machine. But again, not annoyingly loud. The machine wipes clean easily once you manually remove the stopper on the bottom right and let any remaining water drain out. (I catch the remaining water and use it on my plants.) I leave the machine's  top open and let it air dry after wiping out to prevent any moisture being trapped inside and growing mold. Once dry, I close the lid to keep out any dust or debris. The machine tells you when it needs more water and the buttons are easy to use. I like that I can turn it off when I'm done. Make sure to give it several inches of room around the fan and vent to maximize energy efficiency and extend the life of the unit. It comes with a basket that sets inside and a cute little white scoop.  Super happy with this purchase and definitely recommend this machine if a countertop icemaker option is best for you. I also love knowing exactly what is in the ice I'm consuming.",

    "text": "We had an almost identical situation to the 2016 Review when our new BOSCH HEI8054U Electric Range purchased at SEARS was installed - as soon as it was powered sparks flew and spit all over - clearly defective.  When the replacement arrived, installation went okay but we purchased an additional TWO YEAR Warranty from Sears. Unit appeared to function properly and as a neat freak, I kept to the manufacturer's recommendations using only the procedure/products used to keep the glass top and oven clean. Two months after the warranty expired, the OVEN began burning food - going way higher than the temperature I set. Then the oven door repeatedly LOCKED w/Error Code E115 displayed. One large cooktop burner does not regulate itself well & stays so HOT that it has a gray/whitish ring now that won't go away. My GE PROFILE Range cooktop NEVER did this.  When I contacted BOSCH they said it was a temperature regulation issue & I needed a BOSCH Certified technician to evaluate the issue. On a budget so I've gone without an oven for months now while saving $$ to afford that. Had always thought BOSCH a quality product; deeply disappointed and thought other potential consumers should know before purchasing.",

    "text": "For those of you who don't have the proper faucet for the intake hose, neither do I. You can fill this unit manually. I filled mine with my pull out shower head. Once it drained after the wash cycle, I filled it again, and it washed beautifully. It has a very good capacity. In the first load, I washed my Queen flat and fitted sheet, and a few hand towels. They came out very clean. In the second load, I washed my Queen size comforter. It is fairly light. I suggest keeping the drain hose clipped to the unit but closed by the shower door in your tub to keep it in place. The drain hose is fairly thin, but, if your drainage is close, it is not a problem. The water intake valve is substantial, but, again, I cannot use it just because I have a pull out shower and pull out faucet in the kitchen, too, but for those of you who can use it, it is high quality. There are three levels of wash: heavy, normal and light. That is enough for me. It is quiet. The clothes come out almost dry, and the unit is light enough to carry without buying a dolly. I am very happy with this purchase after my last purchase of a cheaper model where you have to move the clothes from the wash basin to the spin basin. That is basically a toy. It lasted a year. You had to spin the clothes in three or four batches because the spin basin is so much smaller. It would spin in a lopsided manner, and eventually, small clothes spun out, and landed between the unit and the spin barrel, and the whole unit broke. This model was only $60 more than that with all in one. Spend the money, and invest in this model. (Photos included).",

I live in a hot climate, and air drying my clothes is faster. I just don't have the space to air dry everything.

    "text": "I really wanted a washing machine instead of going to the public laundry, and risking my clothes getting stolen or the machines eating my money. I bought this with high hopes. Overall, I am happy with it. It is durable. The wash cycle is adjustable up to 15 minutes, and the spin cycle is adjustable up to 5 minutes.  There are a couple of problems, however, which is why I removed a star. The inlet tube is small in width, made of thin plastic, and does not hook to any spout, rendering it basically useless because you have to hold it to the faucet the entire time while you basically get a trickle of water. I pour water in the washer with pitchers instead. The second problem is that you have to put the unit where there is a drain that is at the level of the washer or under it because the valve that drains the unit of water is at the bottom of the machine and short so you can't put the unit on the floor, and drain it into the bathtub or sink using the tube. The tube is too short for that. You basically have to put the unit in the bathtub or on a wide counter in the kitchen next to the sink to drain it into the sink unless you have a drain in your bathroom floor. [If you do, I am jealous :)] The final problem is that the spin container is significantly smaller than the wash container, so, if you wash a full load, you have to spin the clothes in shifts. As it is, you are already moving your load of clothes four times: 1) loading the washer with clothes; 2) loading the clothes into the spinner; 3) loading the clothes into the washer again to rinse them; 4) loading the clothes into the spinner a final tune to spin the excess water out. Add spinning the clothes in shifts, and you are talking about a lot of work. With that said, my clothes came out really clean, including the whites, and very dry. Please understand that this unit is not a dryer. It is a spinner to spin out excess water. That's it. You have to line dry your clothes after using it or use a machine dryer. I bought a mini dryer as well. Despite the problems, I am keeping it. Almost anything is better than going to the laundromat.",

We have never bought them here, although i should have because they are slightly cheaper than the other outlet I was using. I needed to replace filters again and i saw amazon carried them so i decided to read some of the many reviews.  I was surprised by some of the negatives because i have never experienced any of those things anyone is talking about.  We replaced our filter every six months and sometimes sooner.  The water always tastes fine and mechanically we have had no issues.  I will be ordering more but from amazon this time.",

    "text": "Top loading HE washers that actually work are a myth. After dealing with several it became obvious that filling a top loading drum 1/4 full with water then without an agitator try to get clothes clean was simply against the laws of physics. Yes front loaders can do it because they are able to tumble the clothes through the water but it's just not possible for a top loader to do the job with so little water and no agitator. We started looking at old school top loaders again since our laundry room just isn't configured to handle a front loader without some major remodeling plus we didn't like the idea of having to dry the inside of the door and gasket and leave the door cracked open to breath on the front loaders. We did a ton of research and reading and stumbled upon Speed Queen. The model AWN432 is an old school top loader that actually fills the drum with water and has an agitator. All the glowing reviews and stated years of trouble free service sold us. We went to our local appliance store and bought one on the spot. After we made the purchase the salesman said that was the 4th one he had sold in a week and that more and more people were looking for alternatives to HE top loaders. So far the Speed Queen has been rock solid with a total regular wash cycle of around 30 minutes compared to the hour or so the HE machines take. This machine handles odds loads like bath mats and mixed towels without any out-of-balance issues. In fact, I dare say you could set a glass of water on top, filled to the rim, and not a drop would slosh out. The clothes seem to be just as dry at the end of the cycle as they were in our HE washer so it does a good job of spinning out the water. It is so nice to not have to run multiple cycles and double rinse all the time to get our clothes just acceptably clean. So far we have yet to use the 2nd rinse feature on the Speed Queen. The Speed Queens have great warranties and are made with commercial duty parts (no plastic gears or bushings in these machines). The high capacity claims of the HE top loaders are just that- claims. If you want to have clothes that are clean from an HE you have to put in a lot less than the stated capacity. The Speed Queen can be stuffed full and still does a great job. So far we are totally satisfied with our new Speed Queen that is built like a tank. If anything changes I will update this review.",

I went for the 8-10 cup size home use package and the filters could have been deeper but they are the proper diameter.  Basically, each filter contains the grounds during brewing but I can't just dump the basket in the trash--the filter sticks to the basket.  In the end, the coffee in the carafe is clear and I don't have sediment in the bottom of the cup.  As other reviewers point out, the paper filters tend to hold a little too much of the essential flavoring oils and the coffee tastes a bit 'over-filtered' in the end.<br /><br />I suspect Bunn's business plan involves selling these peripheral supplies although I would rather use a gold mesh filter than have to fuss with these every morning.  Bunn doesn't offer that option.",

I've had other wick type humidifiers, but it required more than one unit to keep the humidity at a comfortable level.  Therefore, I didn't expect much, but wanted something that was easier to keep clean. Depending upon how much heat is required in the house (1800 square ft on one level) the humidity stays above 30% and goes as high as 40%. I keep the unit centrally located and close to a return air grill. Something I think is weird is that one of the tanks drains faster than the other, even if I swap the sides. And I do make sure the water drains the same from both. But this hasn't really been a problem. I just keep the faster draining tank on the side that's easiest to put on and take off. I clean the unit as recommended.. It's a lot easier than my old swamp cooler. When I remove the wick for cleaning, I turn it over and place it into a bucket of water to soften up the top part of the wick. I think this greatly prolongs its life. After almost 3 months, I'm still using the same wick that came with the unit.",

    "text": "Please Do Not trim away foam to fit as others have suggested, this is incorrect and will lead to problems. Push from fridge side with a purpose and assist retaining clips through from freezer side, it is tricky and you do have to push and rock diffuser to get clips to latch on freezer side. This is intentional so that it seals 100%. Item fit and function is perfect and it is OEM part. Great seller easy fix for stuck diffuser (usually burned out from icing by diffuser door caused by............poor sealing between fridge and freezer!<br /><br />A lot of reviewers talk about a warm fridge from the diffuser sticking closed but it can also stick open (or get jammed open by ice) in that case it will lower your fridge temps to 30 or less. Sometimes just removing the diffuser and thawing it out will fix the problem.<br /><br />Update: 2023-Still working. I will repeat what I originally said - Do Not Trim to Fit!- All reviewers who claim the attaching prong arms are not long enough are wrong, it is an illusion because the foam is shrunk on the original. Foam has open cell structure that will 'Give' when you install it. Push on the refrigerator side and assist locking tabs  by reaching into the freezer side - it's very simple but does take some strength. If you are a woman or a girly man find a Man to assist you.",

I had to carefully bend the screw tab downward in order to mount it on its edge. The other tab had to be cut off; which I did with a Dremel tool using a diamond cutoff wheel. Took all of about 5 minutes. I removed the plug from the old igniter and using the included ceramic wire nuts, attached the plug to the new igniter.  Another reviewer stated his wire nut did not want to lock on to the wires and apparently fell off, shorting and knocking out his control board. I experienced similar but remedied the problem by nipping (shortening) the bare wires. He apparently had his wire a bit too long and it bottomed out in the wire nut before it could grip and lock on. After nipping off about 1/16th in. the nut tightened properly and securely. The oven now works just fine. Note* As others have stated, just because your igniter glows does not mean it is good....it may not be getting hot enough to activate the temperature sensor to turn on the gas.",

On one occasion a can froze and exploded.<br /><br />Defrost is simple; just turn the temperature up a little and the heat from the compressor evaporates any ice when it melts. I dont like frostless drink fridges because they dont keep a constant temperature. So that's a trade off. My office and home are fully modern but our country place is a little different, and I know from staying there that frostless refrigeration does NOT keep a constant temperature and requires more electricity (more cycles of the compressor).",

    "text": "3 or 4 month update:  I'm still very happy with this hood and it sucks up nearly all heat, smoke, and steam, especially when using the back burners.  Cooking smells lingering upstairs have definitely been reduced compared to the microwave.  I am taking the rating down to 4 stars because I believe the lowest setting should be even lower while keeping high where it is.  75% of the time I use it on low, 20% on max, and 5% on 3.  IF low were even lower then I could utilize the speed control more.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I just installed this hood a few days ago so the rating is based on my initial impressions.  I am coming from a OTR microwave with a very loud and ineffective hood function even though it was ducted to outside.  The Typhoon is much quieter on its lowest setting and probably more effective than the microwave was on high at the lowest setting.  My duct work probably limits the highest settings on this hood but it seems to capture most steam and smoke.  The controls work well enough but it would be nice if the light didn't turn off when the vents were turned off.  The lighting itself is awesome.<br /><br />Installation was not hard if you have moderate handyman skills.  If you are a novice at handyman work then you'll do some cussing, especially if you were alone like I was.  The biggest tip I have (stolen from other zephyr hood reviews) are to throw out the screws that came with the hood and get some hex head lag screws instead.  This will make it much easier to tighten them after the hood is in place.  The second tip is to make yourself a cardboard template of the hole location.  To do this flip the hood upside down without any duct adapters on and trace out the hood along with the holes.  Tape that to the installation location and you can drill right through the template.  Finally I had to modify the rear vent duct adapter because of issues with my own house so be prepared for that.  The hood also came setup for direct wiring so I had to install a chord.  There is a nice little junction box already there to do this but you'll need to buy the chord, screw on connector things, and a wire clamp.  Total installation time including changing out top vent for the included rear vent parts, rewiring, and mounting screw installation was about 2 hours.  Messing around with my ductwork added another hour but that's not the fault of the hood.<br /><br />Lastly check for any whistling before putting the bottom cover back on.  Due to the duct modifications I had made there was an annoying high pitched whistle that was fixed with a piece of aluminum tape.",

I'm not a duct tape person and my screens need to be in place.<br /><br />My old brackets are plastic (these are spring metal with a hole in the center!) so I carefully bent and broke off the remaining bracket and a half. I left the 3 rivets intact, cleaned the areas with alcohol where the new ones would adhere, dried them and cleaned and dried them again. I took a pair of scissors and poked a hole in the adhesive where the hole is on each, peeled off the protective paper, pressed the brackets over the rivets, and inserted the screens! Done deal!<br /><br />Oh, the frames have 2 notches cut out that, if you feel the front of the hood where those match to, would be to hold the screens in place. After many years, those notches were bent inward. I took something metel and, placing it gently inside the holes, bent the frame back to flatten them out.<br /><br />Just like new, no more falling out when I close a cabinet!

First thought it was just me but nope the part was wrong. Additionally this kit was a bit light on the adhesive and grease I'm not sure that there would have been enough had I been able to perform the repair. I returned the kit and received a full refund then ordered the o.e.m. part and bearing installation tool which worked perfectly and I got about twice as much adhesive and grease.

It warms up super quick, heats evenly, and cleans in minutes. I don't think it quite matches 90 seconds for boiling water, but it definitely is much faster than gas. It has a great locking feature if you have young kids. Definitely recommend, just don't buy through secondary dealers on Amazon.

I tried the smaller reusable containers, but I still had to deal with the box taking up space in the fridge. And a few of them even warped if I let them soak in hot water for too long. I don't have an issue with the drawers falling if I pull them too far like other reviewers have mentioned. By the time you have to pull the drawer out far enough to worry about it falling, theres only a few eggs left in the very back, so it's not really a problem. I do wish they had some rubber feet to keep it from sliding around in the fridge, but I'm sure I could find something at the dollar store to help with that.",

You may want to check them out.<br /><br />This method is to screw down to press the ground coffee. Do not forget to loosen a bit before pouring hot water!  If not, it will be stuck with the wet coffee and you will have hard time to release it back to clean.  Al little coffee will somehow drop through the bottom holes, you may want to shake a bit to reduce them before placing on your cup.  I use a Japanese tea strainer to catch the used coffee,to  keep them from going down the drain (it will  plug the pipe, they say)<br /><br />As it's origin, I think  the coffee harvested in Vietnam makes the best taste with condense milk!

After that I could not get it to start except just at random times.  The second one last 13 days and again would run 2/3 thru cycle and lock up.  At least I could get it to drain and try to start running again but once it fails to complete cycle it always fails... :-(<br /><br />So I called Samsung and I was referred to their &#34;Elite&#34; product phone number.  I will say I did pay an &#34;elite&#34; price but this is not an  &#34;elite&#34; product.  Samsung said to do a hard restart - unplug it.  Really???  That's not easy to do with an installed dishwasher so the next thing was to cut the circuit breaker - did not resolve.  This is an electronics/control panel issue which is sad because the hard components rock.<br /><br />I will say that the wonderwall technology is awesome!  Dishes were clean and it was quiet.  I will also say it didn't dry the dishes well at all.  I could live with that but I couldn't live with the fact that in less than 2 weeks the second unit was facing the same issues as the first one.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that Samsung threw this product out there.  Its like they had a deadline and whether it was a good product or not they massed produced a lemon.

One immediately obvious difference: the previous model used a light-beam to detect a full tray; this one uses a thermometer.  Not a huge deal: it notices a full tray a little later with the thermometer.  Then I heard the click-click-click.  The ice scooper was jammed.  I un-jammed it.  Fine.  Now it jams every hour.  When it jams, it turns on the full and out-of-water lights when it is neither full nor low on water.  I don't have to un-jam it, just reset it.  I have a few days to return it.  But I need an ice maker.  (As an aside, the light beam on my previous ice maker should have been modulated on the send-side and filtered on the receive-side so that direct sunlight wouldn't have let it overfill.  Duct tape over the window solved that problem.)",

The open nature of the 90 degree contours flow way more than any hand made curves in a flex hose. The hose included is rigid but flexible. Smoother inside and out than my old spring lined foil hose. This allows much more flow. There are rubber liner inserts at the openings of the plastic curved fittings that really help seal, and help hold it on the hose. I still cheated and added a 5 pack of the 4\" clamps with the blue thumb screws to my cart and put one of them each end to even hold it better.",
