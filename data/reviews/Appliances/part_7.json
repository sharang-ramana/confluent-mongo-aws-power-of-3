I still stand by everything in my review as far as the capacity for regular dishes and regular use, but if you have a very little amount of dishes and keep up with it, you'll love the convenience. Also, if you're into canning, it fits an impressive amount of jars.<br /><br />*Original*<br />I'm not entirely sure this purchase was necessary, but I'm enjoying my new toy. I live by myself and work about 13-15 hrs per day 6 days a week so, I'm not home much to create too many dishes. But, the few dishes I do dirty up tend to sit (rinsed) in the sink for a few days before I get the time or energy to wash them. So far, it's been really nice to just rinse and shove in the dishwasher until there's enough to run it. I also really love that I don't have to install it with a water line. It takes a very small amount of water ( I think under a gallon and a half) so it's definitely less than I would use hand washing. I have a very small kitchen, and I like that the footprint is reasonably small. I love that it heats the water internally and has a top and bottom sprayer, as well as a dry program. I had one in my cart that was only $50 cheaper and didn't have a top sprayer, heater, or dry function. I'm really glad I searched around a bit, because I think that $50 extra was well spent. I have noticed that my dishes tend to come out with a bit of a film that I have to polish off, which is why I'm not sure it's quite the time saver I was hoping it would be. Maybe I should just switch my detergent. I've seen reviews where they pile WAY more inside than I do and rave about the cleanliness of the dishes when they come out, so I'm a little confused at that. From my experience, you need to be very careful to position your dishes so the water can actually hit them.<br /><br />Be aware, it's still just a small dishwasher. It's not a magic portal that zaps food particles into the ether. You will still need to rinse your dishes after using them. I work in a professional kitchen and even our commercial dishwasher isn't that magical. I think this product is for a niche market and will work well for some, but may not suit the average household. Overall, I'm happy. It works very well for my living situation.",

They are both very spoiled by this ice machine. As a side note, my husband asked me why I got an ice despenser in the first place, made a comment that it would never be used and then proceeded to take half my ice, if not more. Lol. Never be used indeed! Lol! Anyway. The ice tastes clean, even after it melts it still is delicious. If you can afford this, love ice and don't want to spend money buying bags of ice, I say get it!",

The biggest concern with all induction cooktops is that you must have the right cookware, but here I wanted to focus on what may be unique to this cooktop (versus others you might get).<br /><br />PROS:  Very fast at bringing pots and pans to temperature (for example, I can boil water in about 2 minutes using this cooktop, and it takes about 5 minutes on my electric stove), and fast at temperature control.  There are also some nice safety features.<br /><br />CONS:  This does not have a continuous temp control, but 6 temps-  I found that many times I need a slow simmer, but one temp was too high, and the next one down was too low.  Another issue with low temps is that there is not a continuous low temp- The temperature pulses on and off.  One annoyance (common or not?) is that when you lift a pan off the cooktop, it automatically gives a warning and shuts off.<br /><br />Conclusions for me:  Nice for occasional use, but not a complete replacement for electric or gas.",

Awesome.<br />As for the seller, they were quick to respond to my many queries. Great Customer service.<br />Cons: 1. Instructions manual left me with questions. 2. The hose that comes with the machine could not handle any amount of water pressure. The connection at the faucet popped off repeatedly.  Once I purchased and connected a better hose (steel) this problem was solved.<br /><br />Please note: Anyone in US  who plans to connect to kitchen sink will need an adapter. Draining was a challenge for me. That is, where to drain? My kitchen sink is too high. Tried the bathroom. Couldn't connect to faucet or to power (cord not long enough to reach my outlet) and no access to toilet. So back to kitchen.<br />Finally, I solved by purchasing 5 gallon container (one on wheels).<br />Now I can wash sheets and clothes in my apartment and I am happy. I have to empty my 5 gallon containers during cycle but this beats dragging laundry and detergent to a laundry room any day.<br />Only one issue remains. How to disconnect hose when machine is not in use. Sometimes I can but other times, I can't. I plan to buy some type to glove to solve this.<br />All in all-- this is a great machine.",

    "text": "My washing machine broke at the start of the recent quarantine, and I'm still waiting for an appointment to have it fixed.  With most laundromats closed, in desperation I bought a Wonderwash, hoping it would tide me over until I can get my washing machine fixed.<br /><br />This little machine is great! It is well-made and all the parts feel sturdy and high-quality.  It arrives unassembled but is a breeze to put together, it takes five minutes and no tools. I highly recommend watching one of the instructional Youtube videos before doing your first load of wash, it explains the process thoroughly, but the basics are: determine load size, add a small amount of detergent and fill with hot or warm water to the fill line. Add clothes, tighten down the lid, then just turn the crank for two minutes or so (I time it by listening to a song on the radio.)<br /><br />The key is to turn the crank slowly, not quickly, and let the wet laundry fall from the top of the chamber to the bottom with a good thud each time.  This drives the water and soap through the clothes and cleans them thoroughly. Once you're done, drain the chamber using the supplied pipe, then refill with cool water to the fill line and crank for two minutes again to rinse.<br /><br />My clothes came out really clean! Even garments with cooking stains washed right up.  The only drawbacks are that water tends to splatter around a bit when you drain the chamber, and I found that to drain it completely when I was done I needed to turn the whole chamber upside down and let it set for a bit.  I use the Wonderwash in my bathtub, so a little bit of water splashing around is not an issue.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a perfect little machine for doing small loads of laundry. It was a desperation buy, but I am really pleased with it!  After my main washer is fixed, I intend to keep it to use in my RV camper.  It would also be great for dorm or apartment dwellers.",

This picture is awesome but there are some creases and for $35 the magnet is very thin compared to the ones I'm used to.  Also the top isn't cut correctly, as you can see in one of my pictures.  I'm not even sure why it has creases, considering it was shipped nicely in a poster tube, and the edges are kinda rippled.  My best guess is that they start out folded before they are shipped.  So anyways, more expensive than I would like considering the quality.  BUT it is the right size and will work just fine for my Halloween decor.",

I knew this was going to be a challenge because I can literally hear the vibration of my neighbors AC unit downstairs… Vibration travels like water in this building. But I love this machine and was determined to figure this out!<br /><br />I turned it on in my living room for the first time, on low, and the low, slow, sophisticated rumble vibration just emanated down and out all around me.<br /><br />After 10 seconds I quickly turned it off laughing out loud because literally not only my downstairs neighbor but those on either side of me were probably wondering what the..!? This is earthquake country (LA). Honestly seemed more like a spaceship lifting off because it's a sophisticated vibration.<br /><br />I had these vibration pucks for some thing else and it dawned on me maybe they would help - a little. I stuck them under the 4 feet of this machine, turned it on, and thought I was miss-reading the situation. There was literally no vibration at all on the floor right next to it. I checked everything in sure enough, it was real! These things literally did the job!<br /><br />I got on the machine and did a 10 minute workout with my weight on it and - nothing. Nothing around me was vibrating, I was delighted! Problem solved!<br /><br />Pretty impressive little anti-vibration pucks! (No I suspect many brands like this would work just as well… This one certainly does)",

    "text": "Looks sleek. Quiet. Dishes clean in about an hour. Fits on counters. Love having it!<br /><br />Just be sure to use soap pods vs liquid. The latter doesn't work and makes a mess. And sometimes the pods don't quite fully dissolve either, as common to dishwashers. The workaround is placing them right in the bottom of the dishwasher, gel side down so they dissolve first as designed. Yes, this works fine! It never leaves soap streaks or a missed pod discharge where it sits on dishes turning gooey and not cleaning the whole lot.<br /><br />Also, no, you can't jam as much as possible into this thing like standard dishwashers. You really must be reasonable and leave some gaps for everything to get clean. Otherwise you'll have to re-do them. I've learned ;)<br /><br />Got oversized plates? My big plates technically don't fit but I manage to lean them over more on one end and it works out. Or hand wash. Small and medium pots fit with little else, but large pots not so well.<br /><br />I disagree with one design element… The cutlery basket. It's too big! And by that, takes up too much valuable real estate. After months of use, I got rid of the basket, and bought a mesh pen holder on Amazon and use that instead. It's a smaller footprint and gives way more space for dishes. If you have extra cutlery you can always lay it down.<br /><br />Any hardware store it was exactly what you mean if you walk in and say you need a dishwasher converter hook up for your faucet.<br /><br />Only con: I have no idea what such a beautiful portable dishwashers don't also come with a simple cheap rubber to that would run from the faucet device down into the bottom of your sink basin or drain hole. Instead it splashes at full force from your spout into the sink which doesn't make some noise. This bugged me so at the hardware store I found they sell Liston blue tubing by the foot in the plumbing section. It's cheap, and I just use a potato chip bag clip to fix it onto the white Fossett thingy, and now the water runs quietly through that right into my garbage disposal. It would cost so little to provide, and makes a world of difference and eliminating splashing, and reducing the sound almost nothing.<br /><br />The other con is even though you turn off the faucet when it's done, when you go to remove the white tubes from your faucet, the residual pressure does kind of create a splash of water (I have great water pressure), so I use a washcloth to contain it when I remove it.<br /><br />Overall yeah it's a couple steps to hook it up, but it becomes 2nd nature, and it's sooo worth not having to do dishes!",

The first one purchased through Keurig and the only problem with that one is that (again) the adapter ring comes off in the machine. Otherwise it works fine. Very disappointed in Keurig. Com'on guys.

Some pro's and con's to note for anyone who is deciding on this product...<br /><br />Pro: 2 sizes of cubes, they are the donut shaped cubes so they are really great for mixed drinks and everyday use.<br />Con: It doesn't make the ice as quickly as depicted. The water reservoir is small so to make a lot of ice it is an all day experience.<br />Pro: It is a quiet machine, only thing you really hear is the ice being dropped.<br />Con: Once the ice is dropped, you want to get it into the freezer. Your new ice will begin to melt together and become one big cube if you leave it go too long.<br /><br />It definitely deserves 4 stars, we love the machine!! If you need a ton of ice, begin early or use backup methods. ENJOY!!",

Note: take off vent exit cap before starting. I didn't realize I was done, when I felt resistance, thinking it was another bend in the vent. I ended up twisting one of the nylon rods into a pretzel shape.

Just make sure to squeeze, GENTLY, the excess liquid and carefully 'shove' them into the filter holder device.<br /><br />I took one to work as the filter in that machine hadn't been replaced, or descaled in who knows how long.  First person to use the machine was like... dang the coffee tastes so much better. It even smells better.<br /><br />What did you do to the machine?  Uhm.. descale it then put in a new filter.

So, I ordered the parts and proceeded to fix my own washing machine.<br />I know I need to buy a new one, but that was not in my budget.  $40 bucks was... i got this and some other stuff locally.<br />Works good, but i broke the soap filler dish.  I will be buying a set and donating this to someone who needs a good working washer. If they order the soap dish tray dispenser, it will look like, well, that they have a good washing machine.<br /><br />I've been fortunate in being able to buy parts to fix my dryer and washer on Amazon.  Just have to YouTube search repairs and follow what they did.",

I made sure to use painters tape and a marker to label each water line to make sure I didn't confuse them.  Can be easy to do that. once I cut the old valve out, had to use a good box cutter blade, the new valve was a simple push tube and firmly and it was set.<br /><br />Wish i knew this was why the water didn't come out.  We actually broke the lever where you put your glass to get water and ice. Had to replace that next.  It worked but you had to push real hard.<br /><br />Now with new valve and the lever, my folks are constantly drinking more water from the fridge.  I'm getting a water filter, additional one, to get the ice real clear.  I'm a water snob... Clear ice looks much better too.<br /><br />Oh... the water pressure increased too... so we are not waiting to fill our cups... they actually runneth over!",

Gets near-daily use.<br /><br />The only thing even remotely wrong so far: a modest amount of residual soap buildup, easily solved by occasional use of readily available dishwasher cleaning products, run through as a separate cycle.  Normal for any dishwasher, I guess.<br /><br />This is an energy efficient model without a drying heater.  It does a great job of drying using residual heat after the wash/rinse cycle is done.  Once in a while a few select pieces go into the sinkside rack after the load, to finish drying, but that's nominal.  Most of the time everything is fully dry to the touch and goes directly to cupboard.<br /><br />Tip:  Read the manual and you'll really benefit from this model's features.  Learn:<br />* Which settings to use for different cleaning tasks.<br />* How to silence the beep after the load is done.<br />* Which setting selects advanced dish drying.<br />* When, how to use the Sanitize setting (short answer:  it also promotes better dish drying, so use it regularly).<br />* How to optimally load the system before washing.<br />* How to periodically check the rotary arms and the filters as recommended in the manual.  (So far, only the filters have required occasional rinse out, in my own experience.)<br /><br />This model was an upgrade from what my local appliance retailer normally stocks, but I chose it for its multi-level filtration and other upgrade features:  figuring that, for a few bucks more, you install it, then you live with your choice almost every day of your life for several years, so it makes sense to buy a good performer.

This is an issue because of the flawed design of the bottom rack in the Whirlpool/Maytag/etc. dishwasher where the rollers press down on the splash shields when the rack is rolled in and out to load/unload.  This pressure seems to be why these splash shields fail so often.  Since these don't flex as well as the originals, they are prone to be dislodged when the rack rolls over them.  This can cause leakage.  It can also cause the shields to fail even sooner since they don't flex as well.  As a matter of interest, I recently checked the current models of the Whirlpool, etc. dishwashers and they don't use this splash shield at all but have redesigned the door and the door seal.  I guess the engineers realized this was a constantly failing part.",

The only thing I would recommend would be to have a selection of outlets.  As currently designed the left back corner is the only outlet.  I could have used a right side outlet toward the back to make a more direct drain connection.  I am using this in a motorhome so fit is all important and to that end it is great.

    "text": "Is this a dishwasher hose or a clothes-washing machine hose? It seems targeted at both since it has the bracket for a washing machine and the universal end for a dishwasher. Both hose types are essentially the same as long as they fit. This product is more suitable for a washing machine than a dishwasher, but it should work for both.<br /><br />This is a fine dishwasher hose that you can cut to the right exit diameter. In addition to the exit diameter, make sure the end will fit as there are L-shaped and straight ends. For going into the garbage disposal, having a straight end at that location reduces clogging. Confirm the length you need. If you need to wrap the hose over the top of the dishwasher to get to the drain then 6 ft will not be long enough. This comes with two smaller clamps and one larger clamp, in addition to the extension connector and a hose holder if this is used with a clothes washing machine. For a washing machine, 6ft should be fine.<br /><br />I have done a lot of dishwasher troubleshooting as a manager of rental properties. Most dishwasher drain hoses I encounter are somewhat transparent. I can see water and debris flowing through them and can see accumulated debris. This is useful when troubleshooting a drainage issue or investigating a possible clog. While not essential, since transparent hoses are so readily available, why not get one of those instead of this opaque one? The transparent ones are the hazy white-colored one that allows light through. I have never had a washing machine drain clog, so for that this opaque color is fine.<br /><br />This is a generic Chinese hose and the identical product is being sold under different Amazon listings.",

If you are replacing a drain hose, then you already have the clamps.<br /><br />Dishwasher drain hoses are not all the same size. There are common sizes of the end connectors, but this is not a universal part, and you need to get one that can connect to both your dishwasher and your garbage disposal.

Proper airflow is essential to the functioning of a refrigerator as air circulates from the freezer to the refrigerator and back to the freezer. The circulation fan is not powerful, and I am concerned that this 3rd-party filter will block the airflow. Air has to somehow make it through this fabric. The fabric is glued to the plastic and cannot easily be removed. LG refrigerators have enough problems already. The goal of this filter is to remove odors. Carbon does that. It is not designed to clean dust out of the air. So having a fabric filter is inappropriate for this product.

    "text": "My LG LFXS30766S refrigerator was icing up in the refrigerator compartment behind the bottom drawer. One symptom was that the drain hole iced over, so when the defrost the water could not get into the bottom evaporator pan and I would have pooled water in the refrigerator, where it would eventually freeze.<br /><br />I initially solved the clogging issue with a short copper wire. I had some scraps of electrical wire that I stripped off the coating and wrapped it around the defrost line and had the wire extend down into the drain hole. A YouTube video shows how this works. The concept is the defrost line heats up and the heat extends to the copper wire in the drain hole. This copper wire trick worked.<br /><br />While searching for a solution I came across these drain clips and I figured they would work even better due to the larger surface area. The next time I had to work on my refrigerator I pushed the copper wire aside and attached this clip. I had to bend the tip so the tip was not touching the plastic drain tube. These are made for a Samsung, but they work fine in an LG, and are easier to install than a copper wire because the clip right to the defrost line instead of having to be wrapped around with pliers. I bought two of these in case I have to install the same thing in the freezer compartment, or in case I need to solve this same problem in another refrigerator.<br /><br />An earlier clog with similar symptoms was caused by hard water deposits clogging the bottom of the drain tube, where it touches the evaporator pan in the back. I fixed this by cutting off the bottom of the drain tube to leave a gap between the drain tube and the pan.<br /><br />My refrigerator was still icing over after the copper wire fix, although the problem of water not draining was addressed. I am swapping a replacement defrost sensor next to see if that helps, which is why I had the back off to install this drain clip.",

Using this takes more time than a paper filter due to the cleaning.

I hope it helps other to \"fix\" their machines.<br /><br />Our particular model has what is basically an inverted cup under the filter, meant to hold the filter and its handle in place. Our first error was replacing the filter while the reservoir was filled. The upside down \"cup\" forced a bubble of air into the pump, making it growl and barely function. Wondering what was wrong, we took everything apart, then did the same thing again, forcing even more air into the pump and making it not function at all, and growl horribly. (This is all at 8 AM, at work, pre- coffee. Imagine zombie monkies trying to troubleshoot while in acute caffeine withdrawal.) We really though it was broken.<br /><br />God bless my coworker for his tenacity. He Googled the problem, and evidently the definitely-not-in-the-user-manual solution is to unplug the machine, remove the reservoir, and shake the machine violently. Act like it owes you money. Keep shaking. You are getting the air out of the pump.<br /><br />Reassemble, plug in, refill the reservoir.<br /><br />And here is where I figured out the whole \"inverted cup of air\" thing. I added the filter, again, and it started growing, again. My coworker disassembled, shook, reassembled and (understandably) yelled at me for trying to put the filter back in (because it always growled/got worse when I added the filter). This time I was looking for the air bubble and found it. I could have dumped the reservoir, added the filter, and refilled the reservoir - like an adult - but I just manipulated the filter housing to get the bubble out and went from there.<br /><br />Normal function restored, caffeine withdrawal postponed.

It washes a bit less then the dryers max limit so I don't have to worry about the dryer getting over full. I have posted pics of my unboxing of it. I love the look and it holds roughly a medium load of clothes which is nice. I was shocked how much it actually can wash at once! It was well packaged and arrived quick.",

    "text": "The description says it can be expanded to 29.5 inches (75cm) but if you do that, the aluminum bars holding it to the corners will have less than 1 inch of the bar inside of each end.  This is not enough to hold 440 lbs.  I would say that 30 lbs at full extension is about all it will hold up.  The only way it will hold 440 lbs is when the unit is fully collapsed and that size was too small for my refrigerator.  The aluminum bars are 1-inch square bars that slide into the corner piece made of heavy-duty plastic and that snug connection gives the stand its strength.  The aluminum bars are very very thin and upgrading the quality of the bars will give a lot of strength to the stand.  As-is, this unit would not hold the Galanz refrigerator I have pictured.<br /><br />I did modify the stand.  First I threw away the cheap aluminum bars.  I could bend them with my bare hands without much difficulty.  Next, I went to a big box home improvement store and purchased a 1-inch square steel bar (which cost more than the stand).  After cutting the steel bar to length and tapping them into the corner pieces, the strength became a lot more than 440 lbs.<br /><br />Bottom line is that as described, the sturdiness of the stand reduces significantly as you expand the stand length and width.  The specs must describe the stand when it's fully collapsed.  With a little know-how, you can make this work better by upgrading the length and strength of the bars.",

When you open them to their max length, they do slightly snap lock into place, which is good.  It doesn't appear to be that strong of a lock as with a little pressure it does collapse.  In addition, It only snap-locks on one side of the basket.  The other side is loose.  I was worried that if I put too much stuff in the basket that it might collapse under the weight and fall.  To fix this I used a zip-tie and zipped it on both sides so that it could not collapse and now I'm satisfied.  I've had them in use for a few months now and I'm very happy with them.  The only con here is that they are fairly expensive for basically plastic.  It is a very thick and strong plastic so maybe that is the hidden value.",

We had a whirlpool last 20 years and then upgraded to an HE machine thinking how wonderful with 4 children and 8-10 loads per week  ... Sadly,  our LG Top Load that Consumer Reports actually ranked  the #`1 top load machine in 2014 lasted only 3 years.  Less water and washing more clothes with no agitator was the draw ... (4.3 cubic feet - with no agitator)  The trade offs were not worth it!  Washing cycle times in excess of 90-105 minutes plus our clothes really did not get that clean - even using pre-soak and extra rinse features ...  Notice the uptick with increased market offerings of  washing machine fragrance products?  Downy and UnStoppables are filling need to make poorly washed HE clothes smell better!  They are covering up the FACT that HE machines SIMPLY DO NOT CLEAN and RINSE as WELL as traditional AGITATOR MACHINES<br /><br />Only Now that we are using a new washing machine - we cant believe what we were putting up with!  Half washed clothes!<br /><br />We began searching for to replace our HE machine when frustrated with the repairman's diagnosis and $600 repair bill we kicked it to the curb -  our repairman said most people are displeased that clothes do not get as clean as they like and they ALL use too much soap which gums up the internal belt drives.  He said using the recommended amount of Soap IS STILL TOO MUCH FOR THESE MACHINES  -  he said he used HALF of the recommended soap in his HE machine at home (teaspoon) and they use scented fragrance to help their clothes smell better.<br /><br />Spent hours scouring online reviews and feedback forums before settling on the Speed Queen AWNE82P  ... found local dealer and brought home same day... Not amazed to learn our salesman has had the same machine for 14 years  - deal made for $759 -  straight of the box this machine was washing full loads in 27 minutes without extra rise.  HE function does allow for HE soap to be used with machine using less water -  but we prefer using regular soap and normal wash function.  Clothes are rinsed out very well and are amazingly clean over what we got from our LG.<br /><br />The basic standard warranty is 5 years parts and labor!  What HE machine offers that?  No one does... If you want a no frills made in America solid state product - this is the machine to buy ... We actually shove our faces in the towels to smell them again when pulling them out of the dryer!",

I also purchased a small digital thermometer to hang inside of it.  When we plugged it in it began cooling immediately--it only took about an hour to cool down at the mid cooling position. Once it was cool we filled it with waters, soda, juice and beer.  The temperature finally settled at 33, so I now have it set at 4-- and it's about 39 now.

If you are troubeled by that issue, don't by anything stainless.  That isn't LGs fault, it's just a fact of the finish. I like that I can easily place a half sheet pan on any shelf and the fact that there are four separate drawers.  All fridges are warmest at the top, so store less perishiable things up there.<br /><br />It doesn't make huge amounts of ice, and the cubes are really small, but I don't have a large family so it isn't a problem for me.  What is a problem is the way the left door closes.  It is easy to have the mullion not go into it's channel, leaving the door open about an inch.  It's true that it will beep after a minute or so, but if you grabbed your lunch out of the fridge on your way out the door, it will just beep all day and the fridge will be about 50 degrees on your return.  Because I have never owned a french door fridge, I don't know if any other manufacturers have this problem.  Could be a challenge for all of them.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this fridge if you have children getting in and out of it for the above reason. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy this same model, even with the mullion problem.  I just keep my lunch behind the right hand door now.",

Keurig is only making plastic coffeemakers, and this has metal components and is better quality all around (I just gave away a brand new Keurig that I found lacking).  This version is even better - more high-tech looking, quieter, faster warm-up.  When our office version, which had supported 9 people with serious coffee addictions for 7 or 8 years, finally started failing, I purchased this one again. It's a hit, and is handling the same heavy use with ease.  That bodes well for my personal model, since I only make 2 cups a day!",

I used to just shut the vents to get the warm air to pass under them, but the air would still get through the cracks in the vent. These covers create a complete seal and don't allow any air through the vents you don't want to use. Happily, the back end of my house is a little warmer now!",

    "text": "The product is a direct replacement for my Kenmore (Lg) refrigerator.  I broke the kenmore filter in half to determine its construction.  It is a compressed tube of powdered activated carbon.  The activated carbon filter does not appear sufficient to remove chlorinated organics ( suspect carcinogen occasionally found in water where organics combine with chlorine disinfectant at the water plant).  It would act to filter particles and would act to remove chlorine ( normal disinfectant found in drinking water)  It might also help with some taste or odor (adsorption by the activated carbon)  I assume this filter has the same internals.  Flow rate is a bit higher which could be from a less compact carbon tube or because the old filter was blocked by turbidity or particles in the water.  I will follow up when this filter is used.  For now it seems comparable to the original filter",

    "text": "There are a plethora of countertop icemakers being sold by mostly Chinese companies on Amazon right now. They are all very similar, with a few differences. The one main difference with this one is that it makes “nugget ice” and set up “tube ice”. The other thing that is “different” about this one is that it is super crazy over-the-top overpriced right now. More on that in a moment.<br /><br />Make sure you understand exactly what this icemaker can and cannot do. This icemaker does not keep the ice frozen. Once the basket is filled, the machine will turn off and if you do not remove the ice, it will simply melt and the water goes back down into the reservoir, at which time the machine will turn back on and start making more ice. The only way to keep the ice frozen is to remove it from the basket and place it into your own freezer. But keep in mind the ice will be “wet” and you will need to break it apart when you remove it from the freezer.<br /><br />The listing shows that this icemaker can make 30 pounds of ice per day. That is a bit of a misnomer. The only way that it can do that is if you continually remove the ice from the basket day and night. I highly doubt that someone is going to be up at 3 o'clock in the morning removing ice from this ice machine.<br /><br />You really want to make sure that you turn the ice machine off when it is not in use like at night, and on weekends if you're using it in an office. Because otherwise the machine will continually make ice… The ice will melt… And there were machine will make ice again. In a never- ending cycle.<br /><br />This ice machine is made in China and probably being sold by Chinese company on Amazon, though they are using a US address. This icemaker is currently listed at 400 bucks. Currently there is an eighty dollar coupon that you will certainly want to click on if you purchase. But you can purchase “tube ice” countertop icemakers for well under 100 bucks. So unless you are just adamant about this particular machine, I highly recommend you look into the “tube ice countertop icemakers first.",

There are several things you need to know before you purchase this machine to make sure your expectations meet exactly what this machine offers.<br /><br />First of all, this machine is not connected to water.  You fill the reservoir, in the front.  Once the water is low, you refill the reservoir.<br /><br />The listing shows that this machine can make 33# of ice in a 24-hour period.  That is only possible if you have someone removing the ice from the basket . . . 24-hous. . . day-and-night.<br /><br />This machine does not keep the ice frozen.  The ice empties into a basket in the front.  If you do not remove the ice; it will melt and refreeze.  If you want to keep the ice frozen, you must remove it from the basket. . . place it into a plastic bag or container. .  .and place it into your freezer.  Note that the ice will be “wet” so when you remove it from the freezer, you'll need to break it apart.<br /><br />You should turn the machine off when not in use.  Such as nights.  Otherwise the machine will continue to make ice. . . the ice melts. . . and recycles making ice again and again.<br /><br />When you clean the machine, you need to add some coffee machine cleaner powder (the type which is mostly citric acid).  I use a bottle brush to clean the inside the best that I can.  When you start the cleaning cycle, it will run the solution through the machine several times.  You need to make sure you use fresh clean water and let it cycle a few times also.<br /><br />This ice machine is Made in China and being sold by a Chinese company on Amazon.  This machine makes 24 small cubes at a time.  Other, similar machines, are offered which make nice cubes for under a hundred bucks.  Some also have a timer so they turn-off at night.",

But if your expectations are too high, you will be very disappointed.<br /><br />Some of the basic things you need to know about this icemaker… First of all, it is not connected to a water source. You pour water into the reservoir. Next, the ice is not kept frozen inside. The machine will make ice until the bin is full. Then the ice will melt, if not removed from the bin, and will be recycled again and again and again. Freezing… Melting… Freezing… Melting… And so on. For this reason, you really need to turn it off at night when you're sleeping or when you leave the office, if you are using it in an office environment.<br /><br />When the bin is full, which takes about an hour, you will have enough ice to fill a 32 ounce water bottle. Though the listing shows that it will make 26 pounds of ice within twenty-four hours, that is only possible if someone is going to remove the ice each time the bin is full… Day and night. If you want to make ice and save it, then you will need to place it into your own freezer.

    "text": "There are a lot of these countertop icemakers being sold by Chinese companies on Amazon right now. Most of them work exactly the same, though they may look slightly different. But you need to make sure you understand exactly how they work before purchasing. As long as your expectations meet what the actual icemaker will do, then you will be fine.<br /><br />The listing shows that this ice machine makes 26 pounds of ice in a twenty-four hour period. That is only possible if you remove the ice each time the bin is full. The bin holds enough ice to fill a 32 ounce water bottle. It takes approximately one hour for the bin to fill.  So someone would have to remove the ice day and night to actually make 26 pounds worth of ice. If you do not remove the eyes, then it simply melts and is recycled again and again. The ice is not kept frozen inside the machine. The only way to keep the ice frozen would be to remove it and place it in your own freezer. On top of this, the ice is “wet” and will freeze together if you place it in your own freezer. So you will need to break it apart to use it. Also, this ice machine is not connected to a water source. You must pour water into the machine for it to make ice.<br /><br />By ice maker in my freezer stopped working a while ago. But the overall refrigerator freezer works just fine. So having this separate icemaker works for me. I know some others who use them in a small office environment… And a motorhome… And so on.<br /><br />This ice machine is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. Again, there are several Chinese companies selling similar ice machines on Amazon right now. So look around before purchasing for the best price. Some also offer a timer, which is nice so that the ice machine is not operating when you are sleeping. Otherwise, if you leave it on at night, then the ice will simply refreeze again and again.",

    "text": "There are a plethora of these countertop icemakers being sold by Chinese companies on Amazon right now. They all were quite the same. I've used several of them, so I'm quite familiar with them. I really like them, but you need to know a few things before purchasing, so that your expectations meet what the icemaker actually does.<br /><br />First of all… Though it shows this icemaker can make 26 pounds of ice in a twenty-four hour period. . . That is only if you continuously remove the ice from the basket. The basket holds enough ice to fill a 32 ounce water bottle.<br /><br />Second… Once the ice has been made, this maker does not keep the ice frozen. The only way to keep the ice frozen is if you remove the ice from the basket and place it into your own freezer. The ice is quite “wet” so when you place it in your freezer it will freeze together and you will have to break it apart. If you do not remove the ice from the basket, then it simply melts and the water goes back down into the reservoir and it re-freezes. So is a continuous cycle of freezing and refreezing if you do not remove the ice. For this reason, you really should turn the machine off when you are not using it like when you are going away for a day or two… Or when you are sleeping.<br /><br />Next… The “self-cleaning function” is really just running water through the machine. Unless you add something to the water, it does not clean anything. I've never come across any sort of cleaner which is made specifically for cleaning such a nice machine. So I simply mix a solution of the scaling powder that I used for my coffee machine and add it to the reservoir and let it “flush” several times. Then I drain that and add fresh water and let that run a few times and then drain it again and add fresh water and do it one last time. I do this about once per month, and so for this is been working for me. I also have a bottle brush and I take that brush and dip it into the scaling powder solution and scrub the inside of the machine and then rinse.<br /><br />Though this ice machine has a handle… It's not really something that you are going to carry around. First of all, it requires electricity. Secondly, it takes about an hour to fill the basket which again a full basket will fill a 32 ounce water bottle. So it's not like this ice machine is made to take to a party or something.<br /><br />This ice machine is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon.",

But if you are at home, and using it simply for your family, then of course while you are sleeping you are not going to be removing the ice.

Have a Chinese company is going to charge $500 for an icemaker that should not cost more than a couple hundred bucks, then the least they could do is pay for professional translation.<br /><br />Also… If you are using bottled water, you have to tell the machine where the water source is coming from. There is information on page 13 which should show this. On the control panel, on the lower right, you should see an image of the ice machine and next to it either a straight line or a circle. A straight line means that the water is coming from bottled water and a circle means that it is coming from the faucet.

    "text": "It's very important that you know exactly what you are getting with this machine. As long as you understand what you are getting and how the machine works, you will be fine. But if your expectations are too high, you may end up unhappy.<br /><br />The pictures are a little deceiving. The top picture shows the icemaker chock full of ice. That is not how this machine works. You really need to watch the video to see how it works. There is a basket in the front where the ice is dropped and stored. When the small basket is full, the machine will stop producing ice. I have a 32 ounce water bottle and the basket will feel my water bottle with ice about two thirds full. The basket area is not cold like a freezer. So the ice will continue to melt… With the water flowing down into the water reservoir area… And more ice will be made. The only way you can continually make and save nice is if you remove the basket, about once per hour, and place the ice into a receptacle and place it in your freezer.<br /><br />The listing shows that this icemaker will make 26 pounds of ice and 24 hours. Well, that's only if you continually add water and continually remove the basket of ice and place the ice in your freezer. So unless you can do that every hour… Day and night… You are not going to end up with 26 pounds of ice.<br /><br />I like this icemaker for what it is. And as long as you understand how it works, and don't have extraordinarily high expectations, then you too may like this icemaker.<br /><br />This icemaker is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. The instruction booklet is written in English and it's very good English. Note that the instructions say that you need to unpack and let this machine sit for 24 hours before using it.",

    "title": "Really Nice Dishwasher Oveall",
    "text": "I have been using this dishwasher for about eight months.  I replaced an Asko dishwasher with this LG model. Honestly, I loved my Asko, but parts could not be found to fix it, so I had to replace it.  Asko appliances are hard to find. . . and almost impossible to have worked on.  So in the end, I chose this LG model.  But there are “trade-offs”.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />This is . . . by far. . . the quietest dishwasher I have ever heard!  I thought my Asko was quite, but the LG is amazing!  You really don't hear it at all!<br /><br />The racks are “adjustable” and they also fold down.  This makes it very easy to place pots and pans in the dishwasher.  You can place the cutlery basket on the bottom. . or on the top.<br /><br />Speaking of cutlery basket, there are “holes” to place the cutlery so they are not “nesting” next to each other.  So all of your cutlery is clean.  But if you don't really like that, then you can simply raise the cutlery basket cover that has the “holes” and dump all of your cutlery in as you would any other dishwasher.  But I prefer the “holes”.<br /><br />I have never seen a dishwasher with so much SPACE!  The bottom is 14” and the top is 12”.  I put HUGE pots in the bottom.  I don't know how they get so much space in there. . . but it's GREAT!<br /><br />The listing on Amazon shows two spray arms. . . but there are actually three.  One on the bottom. . One in the middle. . . One small arm on the top.<br /><br />This is something I haven't had to use, as I haven't had any “issues” with my dishwasher. . . but. . . . if you have “issues” then there is an app which will transfer information from your dishwasher to the app to help diagnose the problem before service has to be called.  That sounds really cool.  Again, I haven't had to use it (thank goodness) so I don't know how well it works. . . but it is a cool feature.<br /><br />The “not-so-great”:<br /><br />Before I start to list these. . I have to say. . . and I hate to keep repeating this. . . but I have been using an Asko for over 20-years.  So there are certainly “advantages” to Asko. . . but. . . to have to weigh the cost and everything else.<br /><br />I didn't know this until I read the manual. . .but. . . each spray arm sprays separately.  In other words, they don't all spray at one time.  Kind of “odd”, but that's the way it works.<br /><br />I'm assuming, due to each spray arm spraying separately, it takes a LONG time for this dishwasher to go through a cycle.  I rinse all of my dishes first.  Just a habit that I have done since I was a kid.  But even with the “quick wash” it takes almost 1.5-hours.  With a “regular” wash it's well over two-hours and pushing three.<br /><br />This dishwasher does NOT heat the water.  That's one thing I really liked about Asko  it heated the water.  But because the LG doesn't heat the water, you must keep your hot water heat to at least 120 degrees.  That's a LOT hotter than you would have to keep it if you didn't have such a dishwasher.  So though this dishwasher might be an “energy star” dishwasher. . . I don't know if they considered that you're going to have to keep your hot water heather much higher than if you didn't have such a dishwasher.<br /><br />FYI. . . . This can all depend upon how far your hot water heater is from your dishwasher. . .but. . . I found out, after first use, that I needed to run the hot water in the sink until it was scalding hot before I started the dishwasher.  Otherwise the water that was going into the dishwasher was not hot enough and so the results were poor.<br /><br />Cleaning. . . . Hmmmm..  . .. this is a hard one.  But personally, I don't really think that it cleans nearly as well as my Asko.  Granted. . . . I rinse all of my dishes anyway, so I don't have any problems.  But if I didn't rinse them, then I think that I would.  But if you rinse. . . and if you load the dishwasher correctly.. . then I think you will be fine.<br /><br />It uses a lot of rinse aid, even on the lowest setting.<br /><br />In summery. . …. . .<br /><br />This dishwasher is supposed to hold up to 14-place-settings.  I find that hard to believe.  Even as a single person, I run a load almost daily. . . but. . . .I really hate to wash dishes in the sink, so my motto is “if it can't go in the dishwasher. . . throw it away and find something that can!”.  Hahaha  So for me, it's easy to fill a dishwasher.<br /><br />Overall..  .. . Even with the “not-so-great” things about this dishwasher. . . I'm happy with it.  My electric bill and gas (hot water) bill are still quite “normal” running the dishwasher daily.  Oh…  . .and if you're not familiar with LG appliances. . . they “jingle” when the cycle is complete!",

Even if you can find them for $5.00, it's too much money.  (MyPod is currently under $10.00, very durable and easy)  MyPod is also currently being sold through Amazon.com so if you purchase more than $25.00, or if you're a \"Prime\" member, you get free shipping!<br /><br />Second, they are a BIG hassle.  If you don't have a grinder, then you have to find a place to find the beans fine.  It's very time consuming putting the grounds in the holder and packing them in.  It's also messy.  If you don't put enough ground in, then you're going to have a weak cup of coffee.  If you pack too much in, the thing will crack or the screens rupture.  Heaven help you if you don't have the top completely sealed.  Also, you can't make cup after cup because you have to clean the Ecopad out and make sure it's completely dry before filling again.  None of this is true with MyPod.  You use drip-grind coffee, it's easy to fill/refill, it's very durable.<br /><br />Though nothing will ever be as simple as purchasing Senseo Coffee Pods, I must say that there's really not one thing I like about Ecopad, and there's lots to like about MyPod.  Don't get me wrong, MyPod isn't perfect, but it's certainly much. . . Much. . . MUCH better than Ecopad.",

The door and the rest of information is actually inside the cooler so you really start there first by removing it. The brochure shows you what and where the operational buttons are. After the 2 hours, you can finally plug it in. Then you need to setup the desired temperature and whether you want the inside light on or not. Then you're done. Very simple. Let it cool and then you can load your wine and beverage bottles up to 31.  It seems to be operating okay the last time I checked. If anything goes haywire I'll let you know. Very happy!",

    "text": "I'm not a HVAC professional, but I am a scientifically-minded home owner. I've been curious as to how different actions affect the humidity in our pool room, among other things. I have no idea if this meter is correctly calibrated or not, and the manual doesn't talk about how to check this or calibrate it. However, I strongly suspect this is more accurate than anything I currently have. I mainly used the meter to check how an action changed the humidity or temperature in a room, which it appeared to do just fine.<br /><br />\"The meter displays three different temperature points of the air surrounding the meter's sensor: ambient, wet bulb, and dew point.\" The meter has buttons that allow you to hold, save, and/or recall data. It also has a MIN MAX AVG function. The directions are brief but I was able to use all these functions without a problem. The meter is powered by 4 AAA batteries. There is a power on/off button, but the meter will also automatically turn off after 20 minutes. There is a button to turn on and off a display backlight. The meter has a belt clip.<br /><br />The display was large enough to read easily. It quickly arrived at the reading (about 3-5 seconds to stabilize unless in an area of air movement). The meter is for indoor use only. The manual warns \"To extend sensor life, keep the sensor's protective shutter closed whenever the meter is not in use.\" There are no further directions about this shutter, but I can't find one despite the picture. It's possible I'm overlooking the obvious, but perhaps the obvious is that there isn't one.<br /><br />I'd recommend reading the reviews by professionals. From the description I read to decide to review this or not, I'd assumed it was around $75 and \"of professional quality\" rather than an actual professional meter. I'd normally have left this to in-that-profession reviewers as I have no way to compare this to similar meters on the market nor can I comment on if the pricing is reasonable. I apologize for that lack in my review.",

A few days ago (now 2021), I had to replace the clutch again. While I had the washer apart, I decided to swap out the couplers as well. So I ordered the same part (this one again) that I ordered in 2019. When I broke the washer down, the clutch was totally burnt up, but the couplers looked brand new. Not sure how, but they were in excellent shape. I replaced them anyway since I had the part. But this is all to say that if you need a coupler, don't buy the cheaper alternatives. I've used these inferior parts in the past only to have them shred in only a few weeks. Buy this part & know that your repair will last!",

More likely, the plastic tab that comes in contact with the door has broken off.<br /><br />This is a common problem that can be fixed by anyone in under 15 minutes. If you've never tackled this repair before, a quick YouTube search can show you how to access the lid switch for your dryer & then install your replacement. Just make sure to UNPLUG your dryer first!!<br /><br />I can't speak to the lifespan of this particular switch, but it's probably not as durable as the OEM part. However, the OEM part will be ridiculously overpriced for the same result. This particular part from Beaquicy is inexpensive enough that you can purchase two just to have a spare. And even then still not come near the cost of one OEM replacement.<br /><br />I've been running the dryer with the new switch in place since mid-Feb (2021) & I've had no problems. So, overall, I would consider this a successful repair & would have no issue recommending this part.",

This is not really correct.  It will circulate the water for 15 minutes but if it isn't clean when it begins \"self clean\", it won't be clean when it is done.  Like many small ice makers, it leaves black pump residue in the upper and lower water reservoir that must be cleaned out.  The upper reservoir is a complex set of features, making it difficult to clean.  Just a \"heads up\".  It does make good quantity of ice fairly quickly.

Anyway, I love the size of this 5-burner stove  top - a perfect size for everything you want to do!  Got a big wok and love to stir fry?  The large, middle back burner is perfect for that!  Just have a small pan of left-over soup for a light lunch?  The small, right front burner is perfect for that!  I also love the slate gray/charcoal black color of this stove top - it blends in well to any surrounding.  Beautiful, useful - almost professional grade in my opinion.  Of course, I'm not a master chef, but for a person who loves to cook, this is a wonderful gas stove top.",

    "text": "I have used pretty much every type of stove top, on occasion, that you can think of and gas is my preferred stove top.  Why?  It is instant on, instant off, can be minutely adjusted (not just \"dialed in\" like coil electric stoves) for whatever you are cooking.  Specifically, there is NO substitute for gas when making candy that requires watching the temperature of that boiling, bubbling goo - electric stove tops will burn it 9 times out of 10.  So, now you know why I got THIS stove top was to set up my permanent outdoor kitchen.  I weighed the costs of having my awful electric stove top in my kitchen replaced with gas (meaning I have an all-electric home) and decided I would rather put together an outdoor kitchen instead as I do live where it is hot much longer than it is cool throughout the year).  My house is set up to where I have a really good place just steps from my indoor kitchen.  This was an easy, drop in stove top for the counter and the great thing is, I have a propane powered pizza oven as well as a charcoal grill - I am set up for the whole meal, whatever that might be!  I do also have an interesting sink set up as well so that I can fill pans with water and wash off all the dirty dishes outside.  Having this stove top inside my house would have been perfect, but it is working just as well in my outdoor kitchen and truth be told, I enjoy cooking outside!",

The electricity has be wired and I did test the propane to ensure it was hooked up properly (no leaks) and that the plug for the electricity used to spark the flames also worked.  So, I do have a little more work to do before I can take my camper out on the road, but I'm pleased to have a functioning kitchen (didn't mention my hot water on demand hooked to both the kitchen sink and to the shower right next to the kitchen).

I happen to have a multi-use large microwave that allows me to air fry and bake along with microwaving, so that big electric range is just taking up space in my smaller kitchen.

That would be something I'd suggest to the manufacturer - toss in a silicone mat the size of the cooktop surface as a way to give an appreciated add-on to customers.  I love that this can be used on top of a countertop or be installed as a flush-mounted cooktop.  Would be excellent for an outdoor kitchen cooktop or if you have a big event that would require extra cooking going on along with the main area/items.  Would also be great for a dorm - might be a bit larger than some dorm rooms can handle, but then it can be stored when not in use.

That's why having an outdoor kitchen is a natural and having this induction cooktop is an addition to my outdoor kitchen that makes it easier to make a good meal.  It is easy to use, and with the stainless steel pots and pans I have, it works great, heating up fast and when removing the pan, cools off quickly.

The only thing that I had to deal with was having an electrician come in to remove the plug behind where the original stove/oven sat and use that to hard wire this induction unit for me.  What I love is that it is a flat surface and I also have a silicone mat that I put down on top of the burner section when not in use so not only does it stay cleaner when not in use, but the silicone mat provides some safety for the induction top (from getting cracked/broken).  Last, just recently I purchased a set of beautiful stainless steel pots/pans and they are such a joy to work with on this induction cooktop.

It's so much nicer to be able to stock the fridge before leaving on a camping trip with enough food/drink to last the entire trip.

This is my first 5-burner cooktop - all my others both electric and gas have only had 4 and it's really cool to have 5 burners.  This one also has a built-in timer which is a great feature when following a recipe that states to let something simmer for say, 10 minutes.  I don't have to look for the timer (in my everything drawer so you know what that's like!) since it's right there on the cooktop.  Very sleek-looking and easy to clean, cooks just perfectly with the ability to dial in the heat you want and when you turn it off, it's off.  That's what makes this perfect for me!  Oh, and while I dropped this into a cooktop opening in my kitchen, this could be placed on a table outside and plugged into an electrical cord as well as hooked to a propane tank for cooking outdoors.  That would make this great for events or just for an outdoor kitchen.  For me, this is the perfect cooktop in my kitchen - glad that I went with it instead of an induction cooktop.",

I didn't want my fresh made yogurt smelling and tasting like Kimchee so it is now ensconced in this small refrigerator, doing its ferment-y thing and not bothering any other foods.

So, back to washing which is the first part of getting clean clothes anyway, right?  This little machine is a power horse for doing the small loads and spinning them to a drip/dry situation.  After that, I have added a couple of lines for drying clothes both inside the RV and the one that is attached outside and the cord attached to a nearby pole/tree.  I don't go through too many clothes at a time and waiting for a sunny day to dry cleaned, washed clothes isn't a problem.  This machine is light weight and easy to stow when not in use.

Not much, just about the size of the buses for those with disabilities.  It works for me, but the sink really isn't large enough to hold all my dishes after cooking and yes, I do cook most of my meals when I'm out exploring in the RV.  I have actually tried this dishwasher in my house completely hooked up to the faucet with hot water and found that it works great that way should you have problems with your big dishwasher and are waiting for the person to come fix it, this little dishwasher can keep your dishes clean without you having to stand over the sink.  Now, as far as working with this in the RV, I boiled a pot of water outside, added some cool water and then poured this still-hot water into the dishwasher's reservoir and then plugged it in to wash dishes.  It's one more step - to heat the water - but it really wasn't that big a deal since I was set up at my camp spot and had a rocket stove sitting outside the RV.  The rocket stove heats up fast on just a few twigs and holds a good-sized pot easily.  The water boils fast enough and if I'd had a shorter extension cord, I could have had the Gizmo dishwasher next to the rocket stove, its drainage hose in a bucket beneath it.  That may be my normal set up - easier to eat, scrape off the dirty dishes, put them right in the Gizmo and wash right then and there.  But the main thing is, I really like this little dishwasher and I did have my reservations considering the size of my RV and the size of this dishwasher, but after weighing my options (hand wash in a plastic tub because the RV's sink is too small) I figured taking a chance on this machine was worth it.  It was definitely worth it!  Small enough to store when not in use, very portable and able to be used in different ways, this is perfect for on the road!",

The fact that this has no knobs and is a completely flat surface is great - nothing to catch food debris at all.  Meaning, this is an easy to clean surface.  A few minutes of saved time in the kitchen is saved time, right!?!  The induction method that does require specific types of pots/pans, that's not a bad thing, but it is one that requires thought and one of the reasons I chose to split my cook surface into two - both radiant and induction.  I may start a ceramic pot on the radiant surface and finish it in the oven.  I do have a couple of radiant heat type cookware that can go from stovetop to oven, but I'm more likely to use something else as the pieces I have that can go into the oven, their lids cannot.

    "title": "I lived on a houseboat for 3 years and used both radiant and induction \"twosies\"",
    "text": "Houseboats - boats in general - require different setups.  Much like RVs, actually.  But the thing about that kind of living is that kitchen areas are small and require that things be moveable/storeable.  To get to the point, I cooked on both radiant and induction plates with two burners each so I did have a full-size stovetop, but they were easier to store when I needed the countertop for other things.  Of the two cooking surfaces, I did find radiant cooktops to be a bit more versatile as induction requires that the utensil have a metal bottom so that the heat reaction would occur.  Not that induction is bad, but it does require more thought in the preparation.  Radiant heat cooktops are the better part of electric cooking - no coils that are exposed, a flat surface that stays that way (I have had a couple of stove tops that one coiled burner was slightly bent up) and is easy to clean.  This surface was fairly easy to install - the electrician was here for right at 30 minutes as I had already removed my traditional oven/stove and replaced it with a Goodwill lower kitchen cabinet.  The back of the cabinet was removed, the top I had already cut to fit this drop in unit and that's exactly what I did and then let the electrician do his part to get this wired.  Now, if you are wondering what I will be doing without an oven that went out the door with the traditional stove, I have a multi-use full size microwave that also air fries, bakes, and broils.  I can fit two full size cookie sheets in my microwave unit and yes, I can cook with metal when using air fry, bake or broil.  Back to the radiant heat cooktop - electrician gone, I had been waiting to try it out and grabbed a smaller skillet, a frozen burger and got to it!  Radiant heat doesn't cook faster or better if that's what you think, but it works great and my burger was finished in a short time.  The burner does take time to cool down, but that's more or less a given with most electric heating.  That is probably the biggest plus of induction over radiant cooking, in how it cools down; however, I am more than pleased with how this radiant heat cooktop is truly and completely flat.  No knobs to turn/twist!  The four burners have a touch-sensitive section in the front to pick which one you want to use and also, two are 1200 watt and two are 1800 watt so you have higher power for stir frying or the like.  One last thing - as I mentioned, I had an electrician wire this cooktop because it had to be tied to a 220 breaker/30 amp load in my home's circuit box.  Being that I'm not comfortable working with electric lines, best to pay someone who knows what they are doing, right?  So, bottom line is, if you are ready to upgrade your kitchen, this radiant heat flat cooktop would be a wonderful addition  to your kitchen.",

    "text": "This is a really nice outdoor pizza oven overall, but it takes some finesse. The unit seems like it's built well and it's a bit sizeable. I wasn't sure if it would need the small camping propane tanks or a full tank, so after reviewing the instructions, I realized a full-sized tank was in order. Thankfully I had one on hand for my grill, so it was an easy switch to get this pizza oven in working order. You will need a full-sized tank.<br /><br />This thing really gets hot as promised. The temp surpassed the capabilities of my hand-held infrared thermometer (which I expected…some thermometers can read up to 1,000 degrees). I believe this oven does reach the 900-degree range as claimed, which is what you need to achieve great pizzas at home.<br /><br />Let's talk about the Pizza Peel: This pizza peel doesn't lock in place very well at all! The handle folds down for easy storage, but without it locking in place very well, it doesn't offer the control you need while trying to manipulate the pizzas inside the oven. I plan on getting a better peel for future use. If you order this unit, have another peel on hand so you don't have to use this one.<br /><br />As a result, getting the pizzas to come out \"just right\" wasn't easy. I left the heat on the highest setting, but the dough would burn on the outside while remaining doughy on the inside. I turned down the heat, and it would cook more evenly but not get as crispy and golden. There's definitely some fine-tuning to get the perfect pizzas. I think a new peel will help a lot with being able to manipulate the pizzas for a more consistent outcome.<br /><br />While this oven is a bit sizeable, it's best for occasional entertaining for your family or small groups. If you're planning on making larger pizzas, or need pizzas for a lot of people, this isn't the best option. It's really designed for those small-batch pizzas that yield 4-6 slices. It's also worth mentioning that the name brand, Ooni, is on sale in this price-range, so deciding between this one or that one is personal preference. It's a very good pizza oven with a lot of potential to make great pizzas. I just need to fine-tune a few things and come back with more thoughts.",

I'm running it via solar/batteries/inverter. The unit kept tripping the GFCI in my inverter.

Run the Keurig cycle like you normally would... and you've got a good cup of coffee within 3 minutes.<br />My only complaint is that - over time, the top is more difficult to close and seal correctly. This has unfortunately resulted in coffee grounds getting in some of my cups of coffee. But I have owned the same one for over a year, so it lasted quite a while before starting to do that. And now I double check the top to make sure it is sealed before brewing my coffee. It still works well - it just requires me to take an extra step I didn't have to do before.

I knew I needed to purchase a new filter and had priced them at a home improvements store and they were selling for over $50.00! So as usual I thought well I'll check Amazon. I am so glad I did. This filter meets all my needs and more than meets my expectations. Plus I saved a lot of money! One of the best purchases i have made at Amazon.<br />My husband was skeptical and now he has had to admit he was wrong....which is an added bonus.",

I saw the bright yellow glow in the pictures and read \"ultra durable\" and jumped to the conclusion that they were LEDs, they're not. And, if you are replacing the original 10 watt bulb in your dryer forget expecting 10 watt performance from this bulb. It isn't even as bright as 7 watt night light bulb which is the same size and a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />I could be kinder I guess but I am old and cranky, not tiny or flexible enough to crawl inside to changed the darn bulb or have orangutans arms to reach in it from the outside.

The washer-part can be connected to any of the 2 extensions or directly to the handle itself for a shorter version or a smaller wash. But with the standard 5 gallon plastic bucket filled with soapy water, which can splash up and be messy, the full assembly keeps you clear of the washing process. It's not hard to push and pull the washer through the clothes, and the wash goes around as you push it down and other parts of the wash load are pushed up. I tried it on a bunch of really dirty, greasy things and in only a minute the water was brown as a sign it was working. The washer-head submerges and vents some of the water you're pushing down into so the clothes get the jet-action of the soapy water going through them. In another 5 gallon bucket filled with the rinse water, the same action with the washer-assembly removes the soapy water. A wringer comes in handy, but the hardest part, which is the agitation of the clothes in the wash-water is taken care of and much simplified by this fantastic plastic washer thing.<br />It looks unbreakable, and good for a lot of washing!",
