I like that there are different sized burners.  I usually cook for one, and a small pot will boil over on simmer on all but the smallest burner.  Just move it to that one if you're having issues with it being too hot.<br /><br />It looks great, the grates are nice quality and flat, plus they sort of lock onto the bottom so they're all lined up nicely.  I like that underneath the burners is all one surface, so you're not scooping out around each burner all the time to clean it.  Simply take the grates off and you can wipe the entire bottom down if you want to, including swiping pieces off the side to be able to get them out.<br /><br />There are 2 annoying things.  First that the ignition continues for a long time after the flame is on, it takes some getting used to to operate the knobs..also that it won't go past high if you're still pushing on the knob.  I'm used to it after a few weeks now though.<br /><br />The other thing is the surface the knobs are on looks dirty if you wipe it with a sponge, you have to get a cloth or paper towel to clean it.  I didn't realize that the knobs had so many indentations either, those are not the easiest to clean.<br /><br />I had it professionally installed, so I don't know how easy it was.",

These bags are really good and easy to use for making a good-tasting cold brew.<br />This bag won't save your marriage, pay your mortgage, or make sure your kids grow up to be decent human beings, but this bag will surely help you have a decent cup of coffee when you need it.<br />So easy to use, dump, and clean. Just a big bag of cotton.<br />I also like the drawstring on the bag. It's pulls closed very tight and then there is plenty of string left over to wrap around the end and tie it off so nothing can get thru the opening.<br /><br />Tip: turn the bag inside out before you use it so the seams are on the outside. It makes it easier to clean afterward! ☕☕☕<br /><br />I hope this review and pics are helpful to you.",

It is definitely recommended to replace this carbon filter in order improve the overall taste of your coffee. Using a water filter will also protect your coffee machine's buildup of minerals in your water. Why pay more for expensive brands when these GoodCups works perfectly. These water filters are easy to use and drop into your tank. This is a standard size filter that will work most Keurig type coffee machines.<br /><br />Tip: Fill up a jug of water and leave unopened for 24 hours as the chlorine in your water supply will automatically dissipate giving you better quality water even before fill up you coffee machine reservoir !",

I love this 13\" tall ( 14\" deep ) portable Ice Maker Machine as it is easy to move wherever I need it to be. Also fits nicely on my kitchen counter or home bar if you have one.<br />Just fill in the reservoir with regular water (or spring water) set the desired ice size, and you will have ice cubs coming within 8 minutes!<br />This machine knocks out ice cubes faster than my GE refrigerator. The holding bin holds about 1.5 - 2lbs at a time, but makes up to 26lbs in 24 hours. Overall, great for anyone needing ice at anytime. Most important, the ice doesn't have flavored aftertaste. Great for any home, office, trailer, or outdoor party. Uses 110v standard 3 prong built in power cord. If you found my review or pictures interesting or helpful,<br />please rate it as \"helpful.\" I always enjoy writing reviews of products and try to give honest opinions. I base most of my purchases on reviews from others.<br />I know that honest and helpful reviews can make all the difference in a purchasing decision.",

    "text": "I just installed this Waterdrop Water Filter in our Samsung refrigerator and it worked great! Our refrigerator &#34;filter&#34; light came on, letting me know that it was time to replace it. I looked it up on Amazon, and there was both the genuine Samsung part, and the compatible generic part. Sometimes I'm wary of the generic ones because they may not necessarily use all the same filtering material as the OEM, but this was at a lower price, and who doesn't like saving money? I've used another generic filter for our fridge before, and it worked great too. This time I had the opportunity to try this one, so I went for it. I ordered this one, and it came quickly with instructions on how to replace the old one with it. It was really simple, basically just taking the old one out of its little hole in the bottom of the refrigerator section and putting this one in its place. You have to run the water a bit after you first install it because it comes out a little wild at first, but that's true with any new filter. We've been using it for a couple days now, it seems to work great, I can't tell the difference between this one and the old original Samsung filter. I will update if anything changes, but I would recommend saving some money and going with this one.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review.

The thickness obviously allows it hold and wick away more moisture, so these filters, while a little bit less expensive aren't as effective. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend these as a reliable replacement for my OEM MAF1 filter. I'd be better off spending a few dollars more to save more in the long run.<br />I hope the manufacturer sees this review and considers re-working the dimensions for a proper filter.

She somehow didn't notice,& it leaked everywhere in the inside,& eventually poured on to the floor outside of the fridge. Luckily it could be fixed and tightened down more. Which is a feature unlike the original Kenmore filter. I'll definitely order these again. They're a excellent buy!

    "text": "It arrived quickly was easy to set up so within days of ordering I began putting this small wonder to the test. I ran every cycle, did different types of loads, and it leaked, it leaked every run, no matter how much water was in it. Undaunted, I mopped up after it and continued. My clothes came out clean, fresh and were spun so well it only took them a half day to dry hung indoors. Then I did a load of sweaters, the lint trap filled up, I cleared it and followed it with blankets and that was it, it choked. Unable to drain I could hear the motor running but the tub wouldnt clear. So i emptied it, unhooked the tubes underneath and let it drain that way. Darn it. I contacted Panda and they said “junk it we'll replace it”. Impressive. OK of they are willing to stand by their product Im willing to give it another try. A little wiser this time. The “new” one has yet to leak. Cut to less than six months later tge second one is dead. First off I thought it was great that they sent me another one, but it was used. The tub had a cut in it and the motor was broke from its base but I figured if it ran, “whatever”.<br />These machines are great when they run, they run well. The clothes come out clean and nearly dry. But the water pumps are tiny and clearly too small. I dont think its worth $275 which is about what I paid for it.<br />PS. They sent me a new/refurbished water pump. I spliced it in after I couldnt get the wires to pull out. And its running again. Now Im trying to run loads 6L and under and have asked my roomie bot to run the spun cycle repeatedly since its not Necessary and it engages the water pump. I'm hoping if I take it easy on the water pump the rest will hold up. Fingers Crossed! I also found some water pumps for it online and pump them away for backup. Had to order from China took 3wks to arrive.",

    "text": "Bought this back in July. I live in the south, and I do not have central air, so summer is basically a humid hellscape for a solid 3 months. I decided that I'd like to try an ice maker, grabbed this one, and have been pleasantly surprised by it.<br /><br />The ice is a bullet shaped, which took me a bit to get used to, but it works quick, and you get two choices of size/speed. Smaller is made faster, larger is slower. Make a batch, pop in a ziploc bag and lob in freezer, boom you have ice when you need it.<br /><br />I bought this one because I have very limited shelf space, and more importantly, it has a handle (as seen in the pic). My mom has a different make/model and has no handle, and she is jealous of my ability to easily move my ice machine around.<br /><br />It's a pretty great little machine. I'd have appreciated something telling me where to pour the water, since there's nothing showing you and if this is the first ice maker you have used, it's not really clear where it goes. Spoiler alert, pour it in the same side as the basket.<br /><br />It's fairly quiet. Not whisper quiet, and I wouldn't try to sleep next to it, but it hasn't disturbed me while I've been doing other stuff.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great little machine.",

I had to put a folded paper towel under that wheel. They should have had a soft rubber pad under the level wheel to help with levelling and vibration. All water hoses are very short. The washing machine has to be placed right next to the sink blocking access to it. There is no way to regulate the temperature like jeans should be washed in the cold water only while dirty shirts require higher temperature. You can't program the temperature, only wash time and load size, that's it.<br /><br />Faucet adaptor leaks all over wasting a lot of water, it's around a gallon per minute. There is no release water button in the faucet adaptor, when you pause and try to unplug the faucet adaptor, water under pressure shoots right into your face. If water flow is somewhat slow also because of the water loss due to a leaking adaptor, you get an error and water intake stops. You have to open and close the lid so water would start flowing again.<br /><br />It's completely made out of plastic.<br /><br />Day 2 of use: laundry is all soaked in water after spinning, there is water left at the bottom of the machine. Water doesn't get removed by spinning anymore.<br /><br />There is no separate spinning cycle. You have to start washing it all over again if you want just to spin it better.

The OEM Whirlpool item was triple the price and a week+ for delivery, so I went with this cheaper model with 1-day delivery through Amazon. Installation was pretty straight forward if your have any DIY/handyman skills.  But it seems like our dishwasher is louder now, in that we hear a more pronounced water swishing and washing - I don't know if its a coincidence, or we're just more aware of it, or if this diverter valve and motor don't quite line up like the original. But it works. Time will tell how long it lasts (it was not as well built/sturdy as the OEM that seems to use thicker plastic). Additionally, when installing the rubber grommet, it felt loose when fitted in place, so I took it back out, put a thin bead of silicone sealant around the outside edge, fitted it back in place and let it sit overnight to dry. The next day I finished the installation and it has not leaked.  Looking back, I probably could have just replaced that grommet to fix the leak, but I couldn't be sure if the grommet was leaking or if water was leaking through the water diverter motor, so I replaced both so that I wouldn't have to re-do the job.",

I wasn't sure this would work as I thought you may have to manually reset it after a power loss. That's not the case. This machine goes right back to making ice as soon as the power comes back on. The noise level is manageable and it looks great on my countertop. Oh I almost forgot, the ice is fantastic!",

    "text": "So disappointed. I bought this machine when it was on sale around Black Friday and I haven't had an opportunity to set it up until last Saturday. I followed the simple startup rinse and clean procedure, drained the unit and started making ice. In 20 minutes I had wonderful refreshing nuggets of ice. 20 minutes after that my unit started squealing and making horrible noises. Called Amazon and they picked it up and sent me a new one. Set up the new unit tonight. Care to guess what happened next…..yup the exact same horrible squealing noises.  Called Amazon and they are coming to get the 2nd defective unit that I received. Amazon customer service was great and very easy to deal with. GE…shame on you for not fixing these issues. This is not a new design, plenty of time for you to have resolved these issues. There are hundreds of videos and reviews online documenting this issue. Are there any engineers left in your company? Just shameful. On the plus side the unit looks great. Maybe you should sell these defective units as expensive light up paper weights. Run that by your marketing guys and see what they think. Don't forget to send me my royalties if that idea bears fruit.<br />IN SUMMARY…..DO NOT BUY THIS ICE MAKER. THEY ARE GARBAGE.",

    "text": "I bought Samsung Black Stainless appliances and the corresponding hood but was unfortunately unable to install the hood because it was wall mounted and would have come up into the ceiling right under a floor joist.  For this reason, I absolutely need a hood that would be unobtrusive and not class with my appliance.<br />I am extremely pleased at how low the profile of this hood is and how unobtrusive it is. It looks great and does not look out of place over my black stainless steel stove. I highly recommend this hood to anyone not willing to drop $1200 on the Samsung or LG black stainless hoods.<br />I have only had this installed for three days but Broan makes very good products and this unit seem to be very durable and well made. The noise level is very reasonable for the amount of air that it moves. The light works great and I have not had any issues with it. I'm very pleased with every aspect of this hood and highly recommend it.<br />As far as price goes, Amazon and Home Depot had the best pricing but with my Prime membership I could ship this 1 day delivery for about $25.00. This really bailed me out of a jam as the fiasco with the Samsung hood could have delayed my closing. Thanks Amazon and Broan!",

I also love that these have all 3 filtration certifications just like the brand name- 401, 53, and 42. They were easy to install. The flow is definitely less than the oem brand but for the price I am willing to deal with that one flaw. If they got these up to the same .8gpm flow rate these would be 5 star.

As you can see, the blue wheels were flattened out a bit, apparently, causing the drum so sag just enough to wobble.<br /><br />The replacement red wheels are nice that they already have the shaft on them. The washer was a bit small so used the larger washer from the original blue wheels.<br /><br />The new wheels firmed the drum up and works great now. Only needed to replace the two rear drum wheels on our LG dryer<br /><br />Some advice - Give yourself 2 or 3 hours for this job, and take photos of the different screws you remove, next to where they go, using your mobile phone so you know where they go.<br /><br />We had to remove the whole inner back panel of the dryer that the wheels are mounted on so that you can remove the nuts off the original wheels easier. Because the originals are on there impossibly tight and there's no way wedging a wrench behind them like on the service videos would've had any clearance to loosen them let alone be able to get a grip on them.. Also, use a metric socket wrench because we only had wrenches 1/2” (too small) and 9/16” (too big) and ended up using vise-grip pliers and it was very hard to loosen the original wheels nut and the vise grips still was deforming the nut. Use an impact wrench with a metric socket and would be no trouble.",

I placed the order and it was delivered within 2 days.<br /><br />Here's my initial impressions of the new one (black) vs the old one (white)<br />- The new hat washer is much more robust & sturdy, quality is better than the old one<br />- The new hat washer comes in 3 parts; the old one with 2 pieces<br />- Even though it appears that you could wash 2 hats simultaneously with the new hat washer, it's recommended to wash only 1 at a time<br />- The multiple latch points of the new hat washer secures the hat better than the old one; this greatly reduces the risk of the hat washer unexpectedly opening up in the dishwasher<br />- The new hat washer is slightly longer than the old one (0.50 inch); this may or may not make a difference when placing it in the dishwasher<br />- The double-sided instructions that accompany the new hat washer are very clear & helpful; the insert for the old hat washer had a few lines that didn't really say much<br />- Both hat washers work very well in the dishwasher<br />- The new hat washer can be used in a washing machine on gentle cycle. I haven't tried it yet, but will do so soon; I would never even attempt to use the old hat washer in a washing machine<br /><br />Overall, I think this new hat washer is great. It's definitely better than the one I already had. I have more flexibility when it comes to washing hats (washing machine vs dishwasher). And now I can wash 2 hats at the same time.",

I haven't tried carafe settings with this - I just don't go that way...<br /><br />While I also have the “2.0” designated model, and it works fine for brewing cup sizes, I prefer to use this one due to the larger capacity for grinds.  To explain, the “extra bold” designation for store bought Kcups translates to “more coffee in them”. I like that because I prefer a more robust brew but usually use two 6 oz brewings from 2 Kcups to fill my travel mug.<br /><br />With THIS newer version called “My Kcup Universal”, the additional capacity for ground coffee is there and the “strong” option lands my cups flavor on the sweet spot in one brewing.<br /><br />While your mileage may vary, the extra capacity will give YOU far more use of the various brew size and strength settings options that are available in the PLUS series of Keurig machines.<br /><br />Enjoy!",

    "text": "The good: this was a good fit for my LG WM2016CW and I was able to install by myself. The lower half of the door boot still seems to be in good condition. AFAICT, no water has leaked out.<br /><br />The bad: after 1.5 years, I noticed some deformation near the top, then found a hole. I took apart the machine and found two holes (see attached pics). It looks like the rubber degraded---I see small bits of rubber near the two holes.<br /><br />Notes: this includes a drain port on the bottom, but no ports on the top (what look like ports in the picture are sealed off). My original door boot never developed holes---I replaced it after 10 years after I noticed lots of bacteria/mold growth around the drain port (partly because I didn't realize how much cleaning was necessary after each wash).<br /><br />So, this did a decent job of extending the life of my LG washer for an additional 1.5 years. But, it's pretty disappointing that it would degrade so quickly. I might still buy the same one as a replacement since it's inexpensive and I'm used to doing the repair now.<br /><br />Tip: if you are doing the repair yourself, *do* buy yourself the spring expansion tool. The alternative is to attach zip-ties to both ends of the spring, but having the extra hand available to set the wire in place while holding the spring open is invaluable and saved me a ton of frustration on the 2nd try. The 1st try was pretty painful using on the zip-ties...",

I just wasn't prepared for the amount of time it would take to make a cup of coffee. The paper filters that fit in this reusable k cup are difficult to separate especially with arthritis. You have to discover for yourself the correct level of coffee to add. I bought the handy dandy scoop/funnel that measures 2 tablespoons and gets the coffee into the filter with no spilling of the grounds. But 2 tablespoons was too much coffee & it popped the top of the k cup off, the 1st brew. I think it has to do with the gasket closing on 2 layers of paper filter. It's just a matter of trial and error. The thing is, when I want a cup of coffee? I just want to pop a k cup in and brew a cup of coffee, I don't want to play 1)get the reusable k cup out. 2)try to separate the paper filter from the stack 3)get the coffee from the freezer and fill the filter 4)snap the lid on 5) load it into the machine & brew.  I just want a cup of coffee. Yeah yeah yeah, I COULD set it up the night before.😊 I don't always think that far ahead.",

I also got sick of ice in my freezer all solidifying into one massive lump. This ice maker is the perfect answer. I just leave it running around the clock. No, it doesn't keep ice frozen, but when the ice melts, the water goes back in the reservoir and is reprocessed. Several times every day, I go to my machine, and there is always ice waiting without struggling with trays or having to chisel cubes apart. If your kitchen isn't set up to allow a fridge with an ice-maker, this is definitely the next-best option. Of course, with Amazon, you know you're going to get the best, fastest delivery possible.",

Once they left we realized there was no electric plug nor an air vent for the back.  Though it says its 4\" standard for the back, we had to actually buy a second piece to make the standard air vent fit - an elbow piece of plastic (about $4 at Home Depot).<br />Be sure that you have a dolly handy, as well.  There is a screw in the center on the bottom of the machine that you have to remove yourself - that's Step One in the instructions.  Luckily, we just moved and had a dolly that holds up to 600lbs.  No way we would have been able to lift it and not drop it without more people, otherwise.<br />Once we made a couple of trips to Lowes and Home Depot the rest was easy.<br />The machine runs GREAT!  I've done four loads in two days and each one came out fresh and clean.  Definitely recommend this product.  However, if you can hire someone to put it together upon arrival I'd recommend that, as well.",

Fact is, once you unscrew the washer, you'll see how simple most washing machines operate. More often than not, when your machine fails to spin and/or doesn't expel water it's usually your water pump or belt. My advice is to change both at the same time; especially when you've opened up the cover. Take digital pictures of your belt and/or water pump setup before removal.",

I spend a lot of time in my garage and always have to come back in the house to refresh my beverage. Having cold drinks in my minifridge and and ice machine makes it so much easier. And, I don't dirty up the house as much, trapsing in and out.<br /><br />Here are my observations about this machine:<br /><br />It works by chilling the stainless steel 'tray' and running water over it. As the water gets colder it freezes in the tray. After the tray reaches a cold enough temperature, that signals the machine that the trays is full of ice. The system pauses and the ice drops into the bin. The next cycle begins.<br /><br />1. I really like the way it is designed. I understand the tech inside it and am very impressed with how well it works. It is so capable, yet so compact. The fit and finish of all the components equals that of commercial machines. Very well made.<br /><br />2. I like how quickly it produces ice. After I filled the tank with room temperature water, it was about 20 minutes until it dumped the first 'tray' of cubes. That load was not as well formed as the subsequent loads. But, it was good enough to ice down four tall glasses of tea. Then, it continued to pump out a new 'tray' about every 15 minutes. Each tray being better than the last. About half way through that first gallon of water, it was chilled enough that the cubes were completely formed and crystal clear.<br /><br />3. I like the quantity of ice that one tank of water will produce. As you can see in one of my pictures, I have two 1 gallon storage bags full of ice, all from one tank.<br /><br />4. I like the convenience. Not just about having an ice machine where I want it. But, also for the filling options. You can either fill the tank manually, and / or place up to a 2.5 gallon water jug on top for continuous operation. (The instructions really didn't go into the jug option. But, all you do is leave the black jug adapter plate in place. You have to lift it off, to manually fill the tank.)  There is a trip plate in the ice collection bin that will stop operation, once the bin is full.<br /><br />I really look forward to the warmer months, when I can be outside more, in the garage more and have cold, iced beverages on hand, thanks to this Silonn countertop ice machine.",

Saves me time and it is quiet enough to where I can run it in the early morning hours without disturbing my neighbor downstairs.<br />I run 2 wash cycles, one to wash and one to rinse and then divi the laundry into the spinner, which takes roughly 2 to 3 minutes before there is no more water draining and I can hang the stuff up to finish drying. Be careful to load a mix of lightweight items (tshirts, socks, underwear) with heavier items (towels, sheets, etc...) To wash although wise the agitator will have trouble due to the weight on it. I'm so thankful I have this!",

Many videos on line that can walk you through the repair step by step.  The toughest part for me was reinstalling the water hose.  Not as easy as the YouTube video makes it look.  It's in a very tight space and I simply couldn't fit my hand or needle nose pliers in the space to guide the hose back into place.  I used some hemostats, came up through the opening from underneath and was able to clamp the end of the hose and pull it down into position.  You'll understand what I mean if you're trying to install.  Bottom line, it's a good replacement part if your actuator is broken.",

    "text": "Our ancient range finally expired. This range was recommended to me by a salesperson at an appliance store near me. It looks good. The burners are a bit too powerful for the home cook IMHO. Something I've noticed is that the burners will heat food unevenly, as in a cast iron pan of scrambled eggs will cook faster on one side. This is without any fan on in the kitchen. Does that sound right to you? So I have to rotate pans 180 degrees. This is annoying. There's a tiny burner at the center of the right burner which I couldn't figure out, then eventually turned the tiny cap a bit and it lit and stayed on. It's actually kind of useful. The oven racks SUCK, they're impossible to pull in and out, they have odd little metal balls that just do not cooperate, major fail. And the halogen lights in the oven are ugly as sin, dismal North Korean prison camp type of light. The oven has been satisfactory. I do like the big iron grates.  I'd love to have found a 30\" gas range that had four burners with identical BTU output. Having different BTU output on different burners is like driving a car with different sized tires. I wish we'd bought a decent range 20+ years ago and had it when I was raising the kids and cooking a lot, every day. This is more than decent.<br />---<br />The day before Thanksgiving the ignitor failed. That cost me $300. Now, less than three months later, the BURNER has developed a hole which has burned out the ignitor again. I don't have a quote on replacing it yet, but I'm thinking that buying a  *BASIC* GE range is going to be a lot smarter than spending more money on this range. Chalk this up to experience -- \"Though I could not caution all, I still might warn a few\" -- stay FAR AWAY FROM THOR PRODUCTS based on my experience. I am not amused, not in the slightest. This has been an expensive lesson for me. I am not happy, not at all.",

You can forget about hearing yourself think or carrying on a conversation in the kitchen it's so loud.<br /><br />Worse is that the blue and red LEDs *face the user* and are *bare* meaning you can enjoy macular degeneration from the LED light as you cook. This is, to be charitable, just a bonehead stupid design decision. Really dumb. I'm looking at fabricating an opaque plastic diffuser to make his functional. Harsh, needle-like LED light right in my eyes, at eye level?!?! Who designed this?!<br /><br />The range hood has two lights which produce weak, anemic light which does a poor job of illuminating the range top! It looks palid, washed-out. Again, who designed this? My 20+ year old Sears range hood had a couple of 40-watt incandescent bulbs and I wish this thing came with them, not halogen bulbs or whatever they are. Dismal. Very disappointing.<br /><br />This was not inexpensive. It's loud as heck, it has bare LEDs that shine right in your eyes at eye level. The two bulbs it has are North Korean Prison Camp creepy.

    "text": "When I had a small leak in my 30-plus-year old dishwasher, I looked at appliance repair parts sites for a replacement gasket. They were priced at $70 and more, but every site said they were NO LONGER AVAILABLE. So I measured the length and width of my dishwasher door and ordered one that was as close to the size. On-line videos showed how to do the job, but they were for newer dishwashers and not exactly accurate as for my dishwasher.<br /><br />I installed the new gasket starting at the bottom corners where the cutouts are in the gasket. My dishwasher has no marker for the center of the door at the top, and the gasket had nothing to show what was the middle. I ended up with an excess at the top, and I cut it there. Then I calculated how much to cut off by aligning the two ends. The amount turned out to be about 3/4 inch. I had thought I would use silicone sealant at the joint, but that was not really necessary since the gasket ends butted together perfectly.  NOTE: To get one bottom side into place properly, I had to remove a couple of the screws holding the door liner so I could lift the liner enough to get the gasket into the track.<br /><br />The two corner baffles were also replaced. I removed the old ones and thoroughly cleaned the areas where the baffles were to be placed. They just LIFT OUT, and the new baffles just have to be placed in the corners and pressed down so they will fit.<br /><br />The bottom of the gasket has a gap between the ends, just like my old gasket. Some people are selling gap covers, but that is not necessary in this case. Also, when I asked if this gasket would fit my old dishwasher, I was told it did not, and I was told I should visit their on-line stores. The problem with that was they don't have any way of determining whether the gasket would fit any dishwasher model number. Upsell?<br /><br />After replacing the gasket and baffles, I closed the dishwasher door with some effort since the gasket is new. Without any dishes or dishwashing detergent in the dishwasher, I ran the washer through a complete cycle. I had a towel on the floor under the dishwasher – just in case. Everything went as smooth as possible.",

I was not sure this switch would be a satisfactory replacement. It appeared to have the correct number of wiring contacts, and the current it could handle was the higher amount - 8.9 - 11 amperes.<br /><br />The length of the shaft is about an eighth of an inch shorter than my original, and the entire switch was mounted sideways so OFF would be on top, just as it is on all the three other original switches. I used my laser temperature 'gun' to determine that the LO was the lower temperature and the HI was the higher temperature.<br /><br />Other than those two points, the switch is a satisfactory replacement for the 30-plus year-old switch which controls the large eight-inch burner. The indicators on the replacement (Frigidaire) switch - L1, L2, H1, H2 and P - all coincide with the indicators on the original (Magic Chef).<br /><br />If I remember in the future, I'll update on whether this switch lasted any length of time.<br /><br />UPDATE: Middle of August 2017 and the switch is still functioning as it did when it was first installed. This switch rotates easier than the 30-year-old switches do.",

    "text": "The design by the dishwasher manufacturer makes this part susceptible to breaking because the end with the single hole / eyelet attaches to a bolt head, and the cable bends about 90 degrees to where it goes over the plastic / nylon pulley wheel. That pulley wheel has no groove for the cable, and I am surprised it has lasted all these years.<br /><br />Starting the job requires removing several screws holding the two bottom cover panels - two screws on each end in my application. Then you have access to the broken cable. It's unlikely that both cables would break at the same time since one will break causing the springs to let go - and the door will be heavy.<br /><br />The 2 springs that support most of the weight of the door are attached to the other end that has 2 holes. Two cables are required, and both probably should be replaced at the same time.<br /><br />Once those springs are attached to the cables, the eyelet ends can be slipped over the bolt heads. The first is simple to attach, but it has to have some tension on it so it does not slip off the pulley wheel while attaching the other end. Stretching the springs is best done using some tool - maybe a locking pliers - and wearing leather work gloves to prevent hurting your hands when it slips. That is the hardest part of this procedure ... more than standing on your head to replace the screws when reattaching the two bottom cover panels.<br /><br />This is the part that has been breaking about every 5 years on my model dishwasher. At 29 years of age, the dishwasher may be replaced the next time this cable breaks. Hopefully the next model will be designed better and won't require this continued replacement.",

I was not influenced by anyone in anyway.<br /><br />This is really going to be handy when we get our RV next year and start traveling. It's also handy for those that might live in a place that don't have laundry rooms and or they need something washed quickly. Besides most laundry rooms close down at a certain time, so having this will really help it it's late, the laundry room is closed and you need something washed a.s.a.p.<br />Also great for college dorm students.<br /><br />This mini portable counter top washing machine fits perfect on a kitchen counter top. It did not move during washing or spinning. It stayed right in place. The spinning works really well. My clothing items, rung out really well from the spin cycle.. I really love the way this mini portable washing machine handles itself. I was actually quite surprised to see it work so well. This will definitely be going in our RV, (just need to get the RV and we'll be good to go)<br /><br />PROS:<br />small, compact<br />not heavy<br />doesn't move at all during wash/spin cycles.<br /><br />CONS:<br />the hose is situated for one side so I have to turn it around if my sink is on the other side, like it is. wish the hose was in the back center.<br />moves around a little while on.<br /><br />Remember, don't put anything over 5.5 pounds. This is not for &#34;let's see how much we can put in it&#34; type of washer. So you need to be careful, even if you have to get a kitchen scale to weigh out your items, I would and I have.",

    "text": "Pros:<br />-Makes great ice<br />-Super easy to set up, no water line needed<br />-Easy to fill and clean<br />-Low energy drain (average 70 watts while making ice, 1 watt on standby)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Loud during ice making<br />-Designed to fit under kitchen cabinets but we tried it in 2 kitchens and it was slightly too tall in both cases (around .25-.5 inch too tall)<br />-Proprietary filter is pretty expensive and I don't expect it to last long based on how small it is<br /><br />If you are looking for an ice maker to give you the 'good ice' you find at many restaurants and fast-food places like Sonic and Chick-fil-a.. from what I can tell this is the only consumer-grade machine that makes true nugget-style ice.  In my opinion the ice this machine makes it not quite as good as that of commercial ice makers because the nugget size is slightly bigger.. but it gets very close at a fraction of the price of a decent commercial machine.<br /><br />My parents have had a manitowoc commercial ice maker for around 20 years now and I have always wanted one myself but was never able to justify spending several thousand dollars on an ice maker.. not to mention the water line and space needed to fit a commercial machine.  So I was excited when I learned about the Opal bringing this kind of ice to a smaller countertop form-factor.  While it isn't perfect, overall I have been happy with the machine and would definitely recommend it to those who are obsessed with 'good ice'.",

HAD they simply used a better quality sticker, this would have not been a problem. SECOND, the kit did not come with ANY of the electrical connections... seriously for .30cents they cant throw in some wire connectors and the box connector? Second, the hardware to mount the stove to the counter is a cheap simple little piece of metal that is (according to the instructions) SOLD SEPERATLY???? That piece can not be more than $1. And for $1600 maybe I could get a small supply of duct tape for the duct work that needs to be done???  I really wasn't expecting duct tape, but the fact that it was missing all those mounting hardware and caused me an extra trip to the hardware store for them just being cheap to save maybe $3-4 on such an expensive item is very frustrating. Now I have a brand new stove top with scratches in the glass because they wanted to save .00005 cents on a sticker.",

I have stainless steel pots and pans and the heat dissipation is good.<br />I couldn't get a pot of water to boil - it would start to simmer and then the overheat circuit would kick in and turn off the element. Sauteeing is easy but I haven't tried pan or deep frying.<br />I got this to match my red Dash kettle, forgetting the red kettle had died and been replaced with grey, and Amazon accidentally sent me the grey, which worked out great. The unit is attractive, not compact but it's not as bad as other portable eyes I've seen. Once it cools, I just stand it on the side and slide it behind the air fryer, so no loss of counter space.<br />Heat retention isn't huge, but you'll def want to be careful until you know it's cool, there's no \"hot surface\" light.",

OK, so, I have and outside vent for my dryer, but this lady suggested harvesting the heat from your drier to help heat up your home and I thought why not try it.  It does catch the lint.  Just make sure you either use the enclosed tube or clean your old one out.  I have a sturdy metal one and chose to keep using that one and forgot that shaking the thing would release lint.  That was funny as the lightbulb in my brain kicked on and the lint flew out with gusto into my face.  Once you have the thing correctly installed with water and the hose it will blow out heat well.  In the right house, it will work super well.  We have a separate laundry room that is large for the moment that is really cold in winter and it help make things pleasing in there.",

    "text": "This stove came with severely chipped stove top. I asked for either a new top or some credit/discount because of the damage. I didn't even get a response. Now I have to look at that stove top every day and get upset for the bad treatment I received from the manufacturer and also from Amazon, since they're the ones who sold me this stove. By the way the stove is not that great either it burns everything on the lowest setting if I don't watch it. I had to by a plate for around 18 dollars that I use now to reroute the heat which means I am wasting energy but at least don't burn and waste the food I am cooking.",
