Stains you will need to pre-treat and use a little elbow grease on prior to putting it in the washer. I can't believe I didn't purchase one sooner. I use soap nuts liquid and a little borax in the wash water and I add about 3 TBLS of white vineagar to the rinse water.

That fan had numerous cracks in the plastic flange and housing (perhaps due to an improper installation of the original vent cover) and had to be replaced.  The repair shop doing the roof replacement did not replace the vent cover on the fantastic fan, telling me that \"these don't work.\"<br /><br />I made plans to add the newer model Max Air fan cover (even though I was hesitant to put a cover designed to mount to metal flange on a plastic flange)... then I found the links to this particular model.  While I don't like the fact that mounting required cutting lap sealant, mounting into the roof and re-sealing the screw holes (Remember I just replaced the entire roof due to leaks that couldn't be fixed)... Once this was mounted and in place, I went inside and turned the fan on \"high\"... and had more air movement in the bath than I've had since this camper was new in 2004!

When I get Monster drinks from Walmart, they are usually warm. I'll place one in the freezer for about 45 minutes to get it real cold.

The 5 stars rating remains accurate insofar as our experience is concerned.  We've had zero problems with this product.  It's super quiet.  Keeps food consistently cold.  And, for us at least, the ice maker works well.<br /><br />EDIT (3/27/13) Still lovin' the fridge.  Zero problems.  Quiet.  Nice.<br /><br />Edit (2/9/14) Going on 5 years now, and absolutely no trouble.  Sorry to read about some of the problems others have experienced.  Maybe we just got lucky.  Maybe Samsung has quality control problems.  Maybe all refrigerators have their supporters and critics.  All I can say is our Samsung has been trouble-free.",

This was super easy to apply (I did it in less than 5 minutes for two freezers) and since it just looks like a couple of plastic squares sticking to my freezers, my boyfriend (who is very strong) had to \"try\" it the other day.  He laughed and said the double sided tape appeared weak and that the plastic wrapped wire cable in between was overkill and then proceeded to try and pull the cable out of the plastic or the plastic off of the freezer to no avail.  He was very impressed, as was I.  I thought there was no way he would not get it pulled off, but he could not no matter how hard he pulled.

Firstly, there is no indication of a water line so I just simply filled it up.  Must be plugged in so I do wish I can put the plug in somewhere like I wish it fits inside the washer when it's folded down during transport.  Or I wish it was truly portable by making it rechargeable.  There is no instruction on how to properly use so I just threw in a couple of articles of clothes, filled it with water and put in some liquid detergent, pressed the power on button and let it run.  All it does is slosh the water around and then after it was done.  It is like it's left in soapy water.  I had to drain out the water and then rinse the clothes and then by hand, squeeze the water out of the clothes then hang to dry.  In my opinion, almost just as much work as to hand wash the clothes from the start which makes this machine, not really worth transporting or purchasing.",

    "text": "I don't have a Chemex brewer, but I do use a Krups Moka Brew. The filters for the Krups are expensive and difficult to find, so I tested these Chemex filters to see how they would perform. A square Chemex filter is 12\" x 12\", which means that I can cut out 9 Krups-sized filters out of each one. A box of 100 Krups filters costs 7 to 10 bucks. For about the same price, I get 900 from the Chemex. The Chemex filters are also thicker than the Krups filters - I'd say about 20%.<br /><br />I've been using the Krups Moka Brew for several years and love the coffee it makes (and you can even do an abbreviated brew to make something that resembles espresso).  I ran several back-to-back brews comparing the performance of the Krups filter vs. the Chemex filter on my Moka Brew. I used 20 grams of the same home roasted coffee with 500mL of water for each brew, and a Capresso Infinity grinder. Skip to the conclusion if you just want the results.<br /><br />A) Krups filter. I used only one filter and tamped down with a moderate amount of force. The beans were ground on the finest \"fine\" setting (#5). This is how I usually do it on the Moka brew. From the time the water hits the coffee, it took 3m50s for the brewing to complete. Initially there was the characteristic delicious looking thick drip with the dense crema - it looks close to espresso, with a bit of the mouse tailing (sometimes I stop the brew at about 30 seconds and just drink that. It's close to espresso and very delicious). The complete brew had a lot of body with robust flavor, like a great americano.<br /><br />B) One Chemex filter. I ground the beans and tamped them like with the Krups filter. I was shocked to see how fast the water came through. It was a waterfall compared to the rich stream from the Krups filter. The brewing time was only 2m20s. There was none of that rich dense crema at the initial stages and the resulting coffee tasted more like a drip brew. It had thinner body vs the Krups filter, and the flavor was cleaner. It's still a decent cup of coffee, but I was surprised at the amount of difference the filter made.<br /><br />C) Two Chemex filters. I decided to use two filters, one on top and one on the bottom. I also changed the grind setting to 3 notches finer (#2). I tamped it pretty hard. The brewtime for this was comparable to using one Krups filter - 3m45s. However, the brew still looked different vs the Krups. While it was no longer the waterfall that it was with just one Chemex filter, and the drip rate was similar to that of the Krups filter, the characteristics were still very different. Mainly, it still lacked that rich looking initial brew stage that you get with the Krups filter. The body was thicker vs using one filter, but still slightly thinner than with the Krups filter.<br /><br />Conclusion: The Krups filter makes a huge difference versus using the Chemex filter. Despite being thicker, the Chemex filter results in a faster brew with less body and a cleaner cup profile. The Chemex results are still good, but closer to a normal drip brew, rather than a moka/americano quality one gets with a Krups filter. I recommend using a finer grind with the Chemex filter, and using two (or more?) filters - at least when brewing less than a full pot. The Chemex filters will still be cheaper since they're roughly 1/7 the price of a Krups filter. I can't say that one result is better than the other - it's a matter of preference. I prefer a fuller body (and an occasional \"espresso\" from the Moka brew), so I'll still get the Krups filters despite the high price. However, the Chemex filter is an option when the Krups filters are unavailable (as often happens). The Chemex might also result in better coffee for beans that are brighter and lightly roasted - worth testing.",

However, the filters for it have been difficult to find - they're either out of stock or rather expensive at almost $10 for a box of 100. Recently, I decided to give [[ASIN:B000N4W2SG Chemex Coffee Filter Fits Most Conical Filter Coffeemakers - 100 Bonded Oxygen Cleansed Prefolded Filters]] a try instead. The Chemex filter is highly regarded for the coffee it produces, because they say it keeps the wrong stuff out and lets the right stuff through. Plus, the Chemex filter is much much cheaper than the Krups filter because they can be cut down to size. The Chemex square filter is 12 inch X 12 inch, which allows you to cut out 9 Krups-sized filters (3.62\" round) from each Chemex filter! Let's do the math: At $10 per box of 100, Krups filters cost 10 cents each. At $10 for a box of 100 Chemex filters, which make 900 Krups filters, the cost is about 1.1 cent per filter.

In the hot summer months, I have to use it in my tent but I place a fan behind it to help keep the coils cool.  It makes ice all day long.  It is quiet, I only know it's on when the ice drops.  Best of all it saves me buying ice every day at the camp store.  Will pay for itself the first summer.",

I used it along with their manual Wonder washer. Items came out of the spin dryer damp and clothing and towels took just a couple of hours to dry on hangers. I had moved into a townhome with a washer/dryer and gave my spin dryer and washer to a friend who had a camp.<br /><br />The one star review is for my second purchase.<br /><br />Surging electricity costs (doubled in the last year) prompted me to purchase another one of these so as to extract more water before using the regular electric dryer.<br /><br />I purchased from the company direct. It said \"Buy now\" with the \"add to cart\" button on their site. After a couple of weeks of not receiving the unit I emailed Laundry Alternative and they said \"we're getting them in any day now.\" Umm.... why were the units available for purchase if they were not in stock? They have other items on their website listed as \"Sold Out.\"<br /><br />So after another week I emailed again to check and got the same \"we're getting them in any day now.\" Ok... you said that a week ago. One more try a week later... I got no response and still had no spin dryer.<br /><br />I contacted my credit company and disputed the charge - with my email records they had no problem doing this.<br /><br />I emailed Laundry Alternative one more time to tell them my credit company refunded the charge. I told them if they don't have something in stock they should not have it available for sale because I am not in the habit of spending money on items not in stock. The representative told me it was marked out of stock and I purchased it anyway. UM... NO.<br /><br />Then.... a month later... they charged my card AGAIN!!! I did not order anything. I had not received anything. Discover was quick to refuse the charge though, thank goodness!<br /><br />Shady company. If you are going to purchase it... BUY FROM AMAZON ONLY as they will back your purchase if something happens.<br /><br />OR YOU CAN DO WHAT I DID<br />I ordered The Laundry Alternative's competitor's spin dryer, received it in 2 days, and it works exactly the same if not better. I get about 4 cups of water out of a large load of laundry. It looks higher quality and is super quiet. That competitor's spin dryer is sold here on Amazon, too.",

The nice thing is it does not have to hooked to the water line so it can be put anywhere that has a flat surface big enough for it to sit.  Mine is sitting on a short file cabinet.  It also stops making ice when the ice gets up to a certain level and then just holds it till you need it so it stays on all the time thanks to that standby feature.  if anyone has a question I will be happy to answer if possible with my experience with the product.",

It cooled off quickly, and was ready for use within 6 hours.<br /><br />The sides are magnetic but the front is not, which is fine by me! We have a magnetic calendar on the side for our kids and pictures, but thats about it.<br /><br />The counter depth is AMAZING. Our old fridge had a huge foot print, even for a side by side. This one takes up less space but has more useable storage. We have a chest freezer for long term freezing, so we didn't need a big in kitchen freezer. There is PLENTY of room in the fridge part for everything we had in our old fridge + more.<br /><br />Its QUIET. I only heard the water running to it to make ice because I had the door open and was listening for it. My old fridge was a lot louder (Frigidaire SBS)<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this fridge to anyone, and the seller was fantastic as well!",

I bought this unit in March 2015, after doing tons of research.  It got great reviews through Consumer Reports and several other platforms.  I paid over $1200 and also got an extended warranty.  About 2 years in, I contacted Samsung to tell them that the display was cracking and I needed them to replace.  They deemed it a 'cosmetic issue' and wouldn't go further.  Since I didn't know better, I didn't pursue it, until the cracking got worse and worse and the 'SAMSUNG' letters even started coming off!  Ended up finding out that this was due to the extreme heat that comes up from the oven to the top of the stove.  OMG!!  So now I am fighting with the warranty people, because Samsung, who made this lemon, will not stand behind it.  Their warranty only covered one year.  I will continue to get Samsung televisions, but will be smart enough in the future to buy my appliances from manufacturers that have been in the appliance business long enough to know what they're doing.  Overheating of an appliance that causes cracking is not a cosmetic issue!!",

Yet, the Amazon site gives you the warranty applicable to the a/c units that offer 3 years on the compressor. You must keep the packaging to return the items for repair and they will not ship out certain items even if you pay for them (ie: compressor).  This unit costs over $500.  If you have to keep buying them semi annually, its not worth purchasing this unit.  I am going to look for a different product where the manufacturer can service it and warranty it for at least 3 years.",

This WiFi ice makers fixes that! I've had it about a month and here is my review.<br /><br />If I want ice water before bed, I just turn this on as I get ready for bed and within 15 minutes I have enough ice for my water bottle. I have a schedule set so there is ice waiting for me in the morning too. It's not running all day and I love that I can control that.<br /><br />I also love that if I don't use the ice, the water melts right back into the reservoir to make more ice later. I don't have empty water from this and it takes a while until I have to refill it.<br /><br />The ice does melt faster in my water than ice from the store because it is hollow inside. That is my only complaint but this is a feature of every countertop ice maker and not specific to this brand.<br /><br />Love this ice maker!! Would recommend to anyone looking to get one.",

So far it's worked nicely, but there are a few caveats you should know about.<br /><br />The shelves cannot be raised or lowered, but we knew that before purchasing it.  There is an annoying problem with the ice maker, where it shuts off when full and then won't turn back on.  When full, the ice maker arm rises so that it quits making ice, but the arm needs to be lowered manually to restart the ice maker, because it won't go back down by itself.  Fortunately, Whirlpool created a great notification system to remind you to lower the arm, in that you'll know when the ice bin is empty.  Also worth mentioning that you can't open the ice maker door to lower the arm without dumping ice all over the floor, because it gathers against the door.<br /><br />The other problem we've had is likely a manufacturing defect.  Only one door can be moved to level the doors, but when we leveled ours, the door we had to raise the door so high that it rubs on the hinge and this prevents it from closing by itself.  So, we were presented with a choice between a rubbing door that won't close well or settle with doors that look awkward because they sit at different heights.<br /><br />Other than that, we've been happy with the refrigerator and it's worked well.",

The extract was a bit weak, but that is a coffee issue - coffee roast, grind, and packing will take a bit of trial and error. The grind I used was on the coarser end of espresso.<br /><br />There is one issue - coffee quantity. The manual states to put 5-7g of coffee in the pod. I opened up a commercial 5.3g pod and tried to put it all in and it would not. The pod is smaller than the commercial and therefore no way to get in the amount of coffee needed for a great extract. Also, due to the smaller size there feels like the capsule binds a bit.<br /><br />Not a capsule I would fully recommend.",

Now I am fine tuning my choices and starting to get picky about the sort of washi tape I prefer to use. This washi is of good to very-good quality. It isn't top of the line, but I have bought a lot worse! The tapes come in the standarad 15mm width, and have a good amount on each roll (10 m or about 11 yards). The colors are as shown - so true to picture. I found that they generally stick quite well, with the tape ones (non-foil) sticking better than the foil colors. The tape also tears easily from the roll, but doesn't rip or shred down the roll like some cheap washi does.<br />One roll (the red, white & blue) did have a &#34;tacky / gummy&#34; feel to it that I didn't like, and that one did not re-position as well as the others. I don't know exactly why or if it was a flaw with that color. The others were fine. The foil colors seemed a little less adhesive but nothing that would stop me from using this tape.<br />Overall this set of washi tape is bright & vivid, sticks & repositions well, is of a quite good quality and not that cheap plastic type of tape that is just awful to work with. I would buy it again and for the price - I am very happy.",

The size I bought is almost too large for me, a single person, but the size smaller would have probably been too small. This freezer now enables me to purchase more frozen foods and meats on sale that I used to have to avoid because I did not have the room in the refrigerator freezer. This is a wonderful freezer!",

    "text": "I've had this icemaker for about 8 months, and I absolutely love it.  The cubes are small, and if I turn it off when its full and let it sit for a for about half an hour, the ice becomes very 'soft' - I don't know quite how else to describe it - perfect for someone like me who loves to eat ice.  It makes 9 cubes about every 8 minutes,  which might seem like a long time, but the basket is always full when I'm ready for more. When it's full (it's small), it will completely fill up 2 16-ounce glasses, plus some.  I tried at first to keep some in the freezer, but that didn't work too well.  The ice sticks together and unless you think to stir it around every 5 minutes for a few times, you get lumps of ice instead of individual cubes.  If you're just refillng an ice bucket, it's great.  If you want to have a good stash of ice in the freezer, not so much.  I live alone, so it's perfect or me.  For more than 2,  maybe 3 people, I think you'd really need something different.  Just my opinion; I suppose you could make it work if you don't have any serious ice-eaters.  Anyhow I love it.  It's certainly paid for itself a few times over already.  The one and only flaw, as far as I'm concerned, is that the lid will hit you in the head (if, like me, you get that close) if you bump it when it's open.  Annoying, but not a very big deal.  It does require cleaning every few weeks.  It recommends using vinegar, I assume to discourage mold, so I use a very weak vinegar/water solution, wipe it dry, and there's no taste.  It's worked well for me.  I don't use the drain plug because it's too much trouble.  I just bought a turkey baster to suck most of the last of the water out and a few paper towels.  Cleaning takes about 5-10 minutes. No problems so far.<br />  I highly recommend this ice maker for anyone who loves ice or just has no ice maker in their fridge.  I don't think you'll ever regret it.",

Then I learned Europeans have been using them since before I was born.<br /><br />My husband and I moved cross country sight-unseen into what is surely the world's smallest studio apartment with the largest price tag, chosen blindly simply FOR the fact it had in-unit laundry, in some brand-new modern building with fancy countertops and pretty appliances and a polished concrete floor and all things not at all our style, and we survived over three years of living in approximately 120 usable square feet largely thanks to this machine's baby brother, which was small enough to fit under the kitchen counter and quiet enough to run while on teleconferences working from home which in that place meant sitting about four feet away from the machine. (This bigger model however is too tall to fit under a kitchen counter)<br /><br />We're not picky about our laundry: you'd never find us separating our lights from darks, therefore we used the same setting nearly every time, so this machine serves an extra purpose still: it's the laundry hamper, too! More space saved in that tiny apartment!! (Space planning was a really big deal for my sanity. There were NO CLOSETS. My husband's clothes were folded and stored next to our dinner plates n bowls. My clothes were folded and stored in the bedside table's drawer, and that table doubled as the dinner table. We each owned four outfits.)<br /><br />Then finally, precisely three years, two months and five days later, we'd scrimped and saved enough to trade one absolutely ridiculous living situation for an equally ridiculous but opposite one, and bought the biggest fixer of an old house you've ever seen (just look at that lean in my photo!: the washer-dryer combo machine is perfectly level). On moving day as I looked around that stupidly small now-empty apartment I realized I would miss absolutely nothing except for that washer-dryer combo machine (and the hot tub on the roof, fine.). So on our first night in our new-old junker of a gigantic house, I took our mattress out of the bag (pro tip from having moved sooooo many times: first make your bed --pillows, sheets, comforter and all-- THEN put it in the mattress bag, and use packing tape to wrap it twice super tight so your made bed stays intact, and then BOOM on the other end of your move all you need to do is rip it open), flopped down, got out my phone, immediately ordered this bigger brother from the amazon app, and there it was about two weeks later. It had shipped from Minnesota via a freight company, but then had to transfer from presumably a semi to a smaller truck once closer to the city because our ridiculous house is on a ridiculous hill, a 28.6% grade. (Do a Google image search for \"San Francisco stuck truck\" and you will understand - I witness this at least once a month) Still, the machine made it here and the beefy shipping guys somehow brought it in (it is HEAVY) and navigated it all the way back through twisty hallways and stairs in strange places to its final resting place at the very back of the house, and placed it on the platform I had built for it while in transit to keep it level in The House With No Level Surfaces, and on its rough voyage it only sustained one teeny scratch that was easily touched up (not that it was even necessary; the machine already stood out like a sore thumb as the only new thing).<br /><br />Like its smaller version, this one works just the same and has a few modes I still haven't tried after two years and two days of ownership. The house already had enough plumbing backup issues so we made a quick greywater system to water a gorgeous Japanese maple in the backyard, and I think in doing so actually fixes the lone problem we'd had with our apartment's smaller machine; sometimes it would clog (that 0E error message another reviewer mentions) since the lint drains out with the water. Even though I'd run the former washer empty and clean the lint trap regularly that error message made a frequent appearance on the smaller machine. In our lazy greywater setup, I used an existing dryer vent hole through which I put the machine's hose, attaching it to a long garden hose & securing it with foil tape. Then the garden hose drops right off the deck and through some PVC pipe to direct it diagonally across the yard to the tree, where it lands a few feet above the ground, some 20' down. I wonder if the long drop has anything to do with lint not having a chance to build up anywhere. I find I don't have to clean the tub or lint trap nearly as often as with the other, too. I took the tape off a couple times the first year and checked then reapplied to make sure there was no mold building up, no strange smells, and all seems fine. I find with this machine I do have to level it after every few loads (I'd much rather clean the lint trap more instead; did I mention how HEAVY this machine is), but I'm sure most of that has to do with the jankiness of the house and is not the fault of the spin cycle. You can certainly feel the spin cycle from any point in the house -- again, I'm attributing this entirely to the house. And teleconferences are still OK from home because even though this machine's louder, my home office (twice the size of our entire former apartment) is on a different floor and farrrrrr away from the laundry room.<br /><br />I think the smaller model served our purposes well in the small apartment with four outfits apiece, and I think the larger one serves us best in our situation now. While I think we still may only have four outfits each, we go through SO many work rags n towels from our remodel. I think any family larger than 1 might find the smaller model too small and would probably prefer this one. I hooked it up to a smart plug for a few weeks to see what it cost to run and while I can't remember the exact usage, I recall being shocked at how little energy it used. Oh, and before leaving a bad review for a cycle taking 6 hours, remember how big the tub was on your last washer, and how much larger the dryer tub was, and ask yourself if it could be user error. :) The clothes need room to fling about in order to dry! Don't crowd the machine! You'll know you're crowding the machine if things are more wrinkled than you'd expect right when a load finishes. Even loads with only towels (and I splurged on big white fluffy bath towels) doesn't take longer than two and a half hours or so and nothing ever comes out remotely damp. If 2.5 hours is still annoyingly long for you, then set the thing to start on a delay (which is a feature it has! and I love!) to start in a few hours, go to work, and come home just as it's finishing up to warm dry wrinkle-free clothes. In our house of neverending renovating work, this machine makes my life soooooo much sweeter. The only thing this washer-dryer combo machine could possibly do better is bring the clothes upstairs and put them on hangers in the CLOSETS we now have, and then pour me a glass of wine. :)",

I live in an RV, and can see it while watching Netflix.  The wash cycle is almost silent and does an EXCELLENT job of washing.  The spin cycle is slightly -- only slightly noisy and does a really excellent job of extracting water.<br /><br />I plan to write updates of this review; but on Day One, I'm so pleased.  All my clothes are clean, everything worked as expected, given the current pandemic, it arrived pretty much on time.  And I think it actually cleans my clothes better than a full-size washer.  Thank you, Kuppet!  Good job!",

I wrote to the seller. They answered quickly and told me to check the pump to see if there was a hair pin or coin in it. They sent photos to use to do the job. People - I tested the washer with clothes with no buttons, no pockets and I don't use hair pins. I will look at it when I can and get back to you. Maybe by some strange cosmic accident there is something in there - but where it came from will be a mystery !<br /><br />Also, you should know that the hose does not stay on the faucet well at all - even with the clamp. I had to hold it there while it filled the whole time. Not a deal breaker for me - but the pump will be if I can't get it to work.<br /><br />Returning it will be a MAJOR hassle as the box straps were cut and the bottom of the Styrofoam broke when the delivery people 'placed' it on the porch.<br /><br />I'll review and amend my rating after looking at the pump<br /><br />Well, I was able to fix the pump very easily after all. I used the washer about 7-10 times. I find that you need to learn how much water you use for each load to get the clothes to rotate without tangling. You can figure out by paying attention pretty easily. It get 3 stars because you can't spin sheets or throw blankets in it - so you still need to go out and wash those. I also think a beach towel would not fit in the spinner either. I used it in the tub sitting on a stair stepper step for height to let it drain out below. This worked great.

Sounded like some little fan or whatever was broken inside. I tried to power off but the light of these buttons didn't go off and the machine was still running. So I had to unplug. Waited. And plugged again. Once I plugged in, before I even touch the power button, the machine already started working again by itself. With the noise... It is a quite good humidifier if it didn't end up like that. I had to request for returning because it's too bad too soon for the price.<br />After I request for returning, the seller called me and offered me a new one for free. The shipping was fast too. And he told me the problem with the previous one might be that I received a broken one to start with. It works very well as long as it works. And the new one is working fine so far for the first day. The seller is very helpful when there is a problem. So It still worth a try. I hope this second one last longer.<br /><br />Well the second one didn't last longer than 25days.

I am lazy, and a neat freak which causes issues with hand washing (think masks, undergarments, swimsuit, anything delicate) and I ordered this thing 3 times--first the model on facebook is fraud & costs more to return than the collapsible bowl they send you (HATING PAYPAL RIGHT NOW) then bought it through Amazon [thinking I'll be safe from fraud] from XianFenghui $96.56 and it never arrived<br />But this one is the goldilox washer. It's very simple, holds more than I expected, is silent, and works!  You put clothes in, add a tiny amount of soap, press button 1x for 5 min, 2x for 10min & 3x for 15 min.  Then drain by pulling the lever & putting hose in sink or tub.  0.8 kg of clothing is 1lb and 12oz.  It rocks!  You can wash things for work or a date or kids clothes.  I emptied it, then with new water cycled for 5 min & was great to go. Roll clean wet clothes in a towel, step on it to get them 1/2 dry, and hang for rest.  YAYAYAYAYAY!  I love it! It folds to a small size and does exactly what I'd hoped it would do.",

I've changed the type of detergent I use since getting this washer. I was using liquid packs and they were fine in a full size but there was too much to rinse efficiently in this small tub. Liquid, low suds works well and not much detergent at all is needed. I probably use about 1/4 of a teaspoon  (at most) of detergent even on the heaviest loads. I have no issues getting my clothes rinsed to my satisfaction. The spin basket is small but it does a good job. While the hoses are small and lightweight, they seem to be able to hold up well. I wouldn't want to set this up on a cabinet, even if my cabinets were wide enough to accomodate the width, though. However, that might be a solution for others.

The convection oven works well, and we love the rapid boil and digital display numbers from 1 to 10 for low to high on the cooktop.  This unit is well made and has one touch buttons for things like pizza, chicken nuggets, preheat, keep warm, etc...  The convenience and money savings of just being to use the top oven without having to heat up the entire unit is a wonderful design feature.  When we cook foods that need completely different temperatures we simply put one in the top oven and one in the bottom.  The number key pad makes it easy to set all functions without having to push an arrow up or down over and over again.  The only minor quirk we have found is the heating elements are on the top of the ovens (traditional ovens have them on the bottom), so you need to keep the food near the bottom or it may burn the top.  The Frigidaire Gallery stainless steel does not smug like many other stainless products.  This is our first Frigidiare product and so far we are very satisfied.  Also, I believe this product is made in the USA!",

There really are no other good deals out that will fit the Zorjirushi Zutto perfectly. Part of the basket of the Zorjirushi Zutto is flat where these filter must be force in and shut the first several times.

My personal experience is that after a couple of washes and also when I pre soak the filter in hot water, the flow is just as efficient as a paper filter. To clean these, all I really do is rinse them pretty thoroughly. Dish detergent can sometimes trap the oils in your coffee maker or your filter and those can spoil if they're there for too long.

It's small and fitting 10 inch plates is kind of tricky but once you get it its not an issue.<br /><br />It does a reasonably good job and is quiet.  It's what I expected it to be.  Basic and utilitarian with no bells or whistles though there is a beeping sound alert,<br /><br />If you want it I would say say buy it.  Keep in mind I have only run 2 loads through mine so... if anything happens or changes that I need to update I will.<br /><br />update 11.1.14<br /><br />I love it. it cleans my dishes very well and has made life so much easier.<br /><br />Update 7.29.15 about 1 year of ownership/use.<br /><br />after a year of living with this machine I can say that I am very pleased with it so far. I have been using cascade pods and my dishes usually come out very clean.<br /><br />I have noticed a few issues though.  the rack could be designed a bit better.  I had trouble fitting round plates so i bought square corelle plates  hoping they would fit better and they don't. the bowls are awkward to fit in rack. pitchers and lids, my food processor parts, everything is just so awkward because of the way the rack is designed. pretty common 30 oz plastic tumblers really only fit down the side with no prongs. if i need to wash more than 4 I have to cram them down onto the prongs. there really is no good place for long cooking utensils. sometimes the long spoons slip through the bottom of the rack and make havoc with the device.  I think I could solve these problems by getting new smaller diameter glasses or cups and maybe looking for some type of dishwasher basket to hold the long spoons and lids.<br /><br />I often find myself running 2 smaller loads because fitting things in the best most stable way limits space for other things. if i wash the large plates I have no room for the tumblers. if I am washing tumblers and small plates I cannot wash silverware because the basket, using one side removed wont sit in the front area of the rack.<br /><br />to be fair its a VERY minor hassle to figure out how to arrange things and make it all fit. id gladly deal with that rather than hand washing. The only time I have problems with dishes not being clean is if I try to get extra things in and try to not have to run a second load or wait until i have enough for a second load.  &#34;cheating&#34; for lack of a better term.  its easier and better in the long run to accept wasted space and run two loads.<br /><br />after a year I would not trade it or complain too loud. my dishes are clean.<br /><br />7.6.17<br /><br />3 years with this little machine has really impressed me. not bit of trouble from it aside from needing cleaned every now and then. I do typically make sure there is no food going in so my filters stay pretty clean. I have learned its quirks and no longer have issues with the rack. lol  again, I say if you are thinking about this, I really think you can't go too wrong with it.",

Used for 5 months prior to writing this review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Washes dishes well.<br />2. Supposedly saves water (not sure if I can check this claim, so I am taking it as is)<br />3. Supposedly saves energy cause it's not using dry-heat at the end of the cycle but rather FINISH rinse agent (more on it in #3 of Cons)<br />4. Nice looks and easy to operate. Mainly use the AUTO wash - set it and forget it. Also we use 3hr delay so we don't get bothered with noise (later about the noise).<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It is much smaller than other dishwashers we have owned and/or operated (primarily Kenmoore and Whirlpool). I think this Bosch's basic model was made smaller on purpose to make you buy a more advanced washer that is sized properly. For a family of 3, we turn the dishwasher on at least every other day, sometomes daily (when we have guests and such)<br />2. Maybe I got a defective dishwasher, but mine is NOT QUITE. Again, I compare with kenmoores and whirlpools that I have used and/or  owned. We set the 3-hr delay so that in the evening we can watch the TV in the living room without having to turn the volume up.<br />3. This dishwasher goes though FINISH [[ASIN:B0026WRHK6 Finish Jet-dry Rinse Agent, Original Liquid, 32 Oz]] lightning fast. We set the use of FINISH to the lowest, but the LOW indicator lights up every three or so weeks. Maybe the dishwasher is saving water (see #2 in pros above) and energy (see #3 in pros above), but last time I checked water is much cheaper than FINISH liquid. With Kenmoore, we had to refill the liquid no often than once every 3-4 months.<br /><br />All things considered, we aren't getting anymore BOSCHs. Next time around I am getting a Kenmoore from Sears. They all are regular sizes and don't consume FINISH at lightning speeds.",

    "text": "Purchased locally from BBuy, used for 6 months prior to giving a review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Very water efficient. I was switching from the 5-yr old top-loader Whirlpool. This Samsung weights each load to determine the optimal amount of water.<br />2. Washes great even with cold water! (save on energy)<br />3. Easy to use, very intuitive.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />1. I placed the washer in the pan (to avoid flooding the floor in case of machine breakdown - paid $20 some dollars at HomeDepot). The pan limits how wide the drain compartment door opens and as a result makes draining and filter cleaning somewhat inconvenient. (Cleaning is required every couple of months. I cleaned once, but there was so little debris/dirt in the filter. Given this and the inconvenience of cleaning, I will clean it again in 6 months. Clean the pockets to minimize the dirt in the filter.<br /><br />2. Some water is being accumulated in the rubber sealant ring around the cover door - I am talking good couple of ounces. As I can imagine, if it's left unwiped, the moisture can grow into mildew. No big deal to wipe it off after each use, but I thought it was worth warning.<br /><br />3. I searched left and right for the stacking kit for this washer and compatible dryer, but the only place that is selling them is samsung autorized part distributor - samsungparts.com. I went to Sears but they refused to sell me the kit cause they didn't sell me the washer/dryer. BestBuy did not have any in stock anywhere in the MidAtlantic region. Had to call samsung directly and was directed to the above mentioned website.<br />*************** I uploaded a bunch of pictures with notes - make sure you check them out **************",

I would advise to remove the oven door do make it easier to work on, do this by opening the door to the first notch and pull up.  If your oven is not turning on when selecting the baking option you will want to replace the igniter on the bottom, it will probably be under a panel.  My oven had two screws inside at the back that needed to be removed to remove the panel.  Once the panel was removed it was in plain sight.  I would suggest removing the screw on the gas tube so it is easier to reach the screws that hold the igniter in place.  You will need to use a wire cutter made to remove the outside shell of the wire to splice the old and new wire together.  I only had to splice one of the wires, the other fit perfectly like it was.<br /><br />All I needed to for the job was a wire cutter, 1/4&#34; socket and a flashlight.",

I have recently undergone surgery, and I need to have proteins available, and eggs are the best thing for that. I love that the bottom has 3 little Notches that poke out so when you put the egg in there, it stays in place. I bought a large AA eggs, I peel them, and I place them in this egg holder and they fit perfect. I don't know what other people are saying about their eggs don't fit, and I don't know which way they're trying to put them in, but if you putting them in right it Works. I usually boil a dozen at a time, but this allows for more if you need it. It's small, it's lightweight, it snaps shut, and it easily fits in the refrigerator and doesn't take up much space at all. I have seen other egg holders that take up a large amount of space, and cost upwards of $20. I am glad that I waited to find the perfect one that would work for me, and this one is it. I'm very satisfied!! I recommend this for anyone who likes to eat hard boiled eggs and have them ready for snacking or eating, putting them on salads, making deviled eggs with them, whatever.",

This machine washes exactly one day's worth of laundry for me (my clothes, a baby outfit, a preschooler's outfit, and a 10-year-old's outfit) in each load. I have also washed my comforter in it, and can do my slipcovers in one load. It did take me a VERY long time to figure out how to take off the faucet aerator for instillation (get a wrench if it doesn't move, I almost broke the sink using my hands).
