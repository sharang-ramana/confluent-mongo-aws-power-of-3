It's in an awkward place so I wasn't looking forward to it but once installed it has worked well. I initially tried a semi-rigid pipe but had difficulty closing the plastic tabs down all the way. I was concerned about breaking the tabs so I switched to the lighter foil version, which snapped in easily. I noticed that since the foil exhaust is lighter and bends easier it seems to place less stress on the two joints (exhaust end and dryer end), so I'm hoping it will prevent it from coming apart. It took me two attempts to snap in the ring, the first time it wouldn't seat all the way, the second time it popped right in. Just did a few cycles and it's airtight. Now it will be much easier to replace it every year.",

Apparently it overflows during the brewing process splashing coffee everywhere.  I would say 1-2 tablespoons of leakage.  After brewing I first wipe down the brewer spout (usually it is covered with coffee), then hold a paper towel under the brewer opening and pop it open.  This catches the drips that otherwise end up on my counter top.  Finally I wipe out the interior of the brewer.<br /><br />How big of a deal this will be for you I can't say.  For me it takes the convenience out of using the Keurig.  The prepackaged K Cups work perfectly every time, and there's no cleanup of the machine or the cup.  So I'll be using standard K Cups for coffee.<br /><br />I would like to point out that it seems to work better for tea.  I put a single bag in the Fill N Save and may get a drop or two inside the brewer, but nothing like brewing coffee.",

The cost of purchasing ice at the store added up quickly - we went through two or more bags of ice each week at a cost of $2 for a 10 lb bag of ice. Easily we were spending at least $20 per month on ice. We purchased ours at Sam's Club for $99, so after about 5-6 months we have more than recovered what we would have spent on purchasing bags of ice.<br /><br />For those who have complained that their units do not work, there is usually a 30-day period to ask for a replacement or refund. Looking at the overall positive reviews, it would seem that malfunctioning units are the exception rather than the rule. The item that we purchased has worked flawlessly since we purchased it, more than a year ago.<br /><br />I don't know if everyone puts it to use in the same way. We use it to keep a full supply of ice in our freezer at all times. If we run low, we just fill the ice maker with water and let it do its thing. It only drops a handful of ice at a time, so if you were waiting for enough ice to fill your cup, you might get frustrated waiting. So we turn it on when our ice supply drops, and pass by occasionally to dump the ice into the freezer ice container. The ice maker will stop making ice and an indicator light will go on if the tray gets too full, or if the machine runs out of water.<br /><br />I saw the reviews of other ice addicts who were very happy with this ice maker. I too am an avid ice lover... and this ice maker has been a treasured appliance in our home!",

A friend suggested one of those gadgets that look like an oversized blender which  she used for her lingery and some other small items. It seemed to work ok but it was rather small. When I researched it on the internet I came across this little gem and ordered it instead. I liked the larger capacity and the drain made it easier to empty the water. The Panda does not have a spin cycle so I bought the table top spin dryer along with it. That was about 6 months ago and I have not made a single trip to the laudramat since then.(I will have to go there for the flannell sheets, rugs, sofa slip covers, etc) It holds about a third of a normal sized load. Since the \"cycles\" can be modified depending on how soiled the items are I noticed that clothes are getting visibly cleaner than with the \"one wash fits all\" of the commercial washing machines.I pre soak or pre wash stained items and double or triple rinse everything to remove detergent residue which dulls the colors and makes whites look gray after a while.<br />After some trial and error I found the best way to do my laundry is to put a large plastic foot stool inside the bathtub (use an old towel or rubber mat under it to prevent scratches) and place the washer on top of it.It should sit securely, Use the hand shower to fill it and drain the water right into the tub when done. I usually wring the clothes lightly by hand before and  between rinsings but you can use the spin  dryer instead. After a final spin they are just damp and ready to hang to dry. From start to finish it takes a little longer than the usual 30 minute cycle, but I don't have to sit in a basement forever waiting for a machine to become available and I can do other things around the appartment instead.<br />The Panda has made my life easier and has payed for itself many times over. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.",

The reviewer's negative headline had read in part \"I HATE THIS OVEN\".  A little  late now, but Ditto for me a million times over. There is no way any human can clean this particular black glass cooktop and have it look as it should. Scrub scrub scrub. Rinse, rinse, rinse. Dry dry, dry. And then some!  ( Altho you're not supposed to, i have even resorted to a razor blade.) Others in my family have also tried cleaning this top. . A miserable experience each and every time!  I cant even boil water without the droplets  leaving a mess taking \"1/2 day\" ( Well , way too long and with too much effort) for it  to look clean, shiny and smear- less again.  I have had at least 12 ovens of all types throughout almost 40 years of cooking and re- locations.  I fell in love with this one because i really loved its clean, sleek looks . Two of my children also have black glass cooktops.  They assured me that keeping  the black glass top clean was a cinch.  It never dawned on me that their different brands would make such a huge difference.  Soooo, I try my best to use  the cooktop as infrequently as possible, as well as to keep the overhead lights low in that area.  What a way to live especially for someone who has always enjoyed cooking.  Now after maybe 6 months of constant agitation,  Im more than ready to throw it in the trash. In fairness tho, it cooks fine. That's as it should be of course .  Maybe i should just throw a towel over its ugly head .",

    "title": "Great dishwasher...just one risky flaw",
    "text": "This dishwasher is one great piece of equipment. Hookup is straightforward and it really doesn't take up much space in our tiny kitchen. It works well & fits more dishes than I expected. It even holds large items, like pots & pans. Even our wok and 4-quart Crockpot fit. The large items do take up 1/4 to 1/2 of the rack space, though, so depending on your situation it may be better to wash those by hand. We've had to run dishes with really stubborn dried on food through twice, but that happens with all dishwashers. Scrape off your dishes (or soak them if needed) before loading + use a good detergent, and this baby will get everything just as clean as a full size dishwasher. I do want to note that we use the intensive cycle only, though - the manufacturer recommends using a long cycle with &#34;tablet&#34; detergents. I don't know how well the other cycles do yet.<br /><br />As far as the problems, and the reasons for 4/5 instead of 5/5 stars:<br /><br />1. The door was EXTREMELY hard to open initially, and the owner's manual is inside the dishwasher when you unpack it. It has become a bit easier to open with use, but it's still harder than it should be. This is a real danger, because the pulling force could (and has, in our case) make the dishwasher slide on the counter. Imagine what would happen if it slid off. I have been able to keep the washer in place while opening the door by bracing the bottom part below the door hinge, and I would implore anyone to BRACE THE DISHWASHER as you go to open it. I'm going to look into a non-slip pad to put under it as well for more stability...but the point remains - the door should not be this hard to open. I am disabled so I'm sure my lack of strength makes a difference, but it still seems way harder than it needs to be. The sliding is not a small issue, either.<br /><br />2. The drying is so-so...most of the dishes are still kind of wet after the dishwasher is done, even after leaving the dishwasher door ajar & letting the dishes cool. We could just be unloading too soon though, and even having to dry by hand is a lot less work than dish washing by hand.<br /><br />3. When we went to hook it up, we thought we were missing the faucet adapter. It's inside the faucet adapter connection on the quick connect. We spent about 10 minutes looking for it because we didn't realize it was there.<br /><br />4. The dishwasher fits 11&#34; dinner plates, but you do have to angle them a bit. They should be able to go straight up & down.<br /><br />5. There is no way to get water from the faucet while the dishwasher is running. I know you could push the pressure relief valve, but I'm not sure if that's straight faucet water, or used water...and I also wouldn't want to risk lowering the water pressure even if I was sure it was clean.<br /><br />Of these criticisms, only the first was a huge deal, however.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? That's a resounding YES.",

Hooked it up in 3 minutes (just put it on top of my broken full size Samsung piece of junk broken dryer until they come to replace it) hooked up the dryer vent and it was ready to go. I only did a half load of clothes to start thinking it was not going to be able to handle, but it is a really good size. Able to handle a medium sizedoad if laundry with ease. Dries quicker than I expected. Make sure you clean the lint filter after every load and you will get great results. Highly recommend this dryer whatever the reason you may need it for.",

    "text": "So, a couple years ago we got a portable dishwasher which taught me the joys of portable appliances. So I knew these existed but with a laundry room in the corner of our building just a few doors and a flight of stairs away- we didn't really see the point in getting one.<br />Then I got hurt.<br />Even though the laundry room isn't that far, those stairs otoh were *painful* for me so, since the husband was on the road, we started talking about getting a portable washing machine. We eventually decided against it when the husband changed vocations to a tech gig where he can work from home. He's home to help me so, that kind of killed that.<br />Then 2020 came. And the coin shortage hit. And stuck around for several *months.* And, the conversation came up yet again.<br />Third time is the charm I guess cause, he caved. :D<br />So, these are my initial impressions and if there's anything else I encounter over the coming months, I'll post it below.<br /><br />Is it easy?<br />For us, it worked right out of the box. With an adapter already installed on the kitchen faucet for the dishwasher, the quick release hose fit just fine already-- in fact, the only thing we \"had\" to buy was a dolly but that was only because we're on the second floor and it's quieter (and slightly easier) to roll in and out of position than the wheels that it already has. Were we on the ground floor, we wouldn't have bothered. So, extra points for the little wheels. They were a nice touch.<br /><br />I also like the separate options- for example it can do just a rinse and spin or even just a spin if you want as well as adjust the water level. These have already proven useful for us since if you're going to overload it (and let's face facts, *everyone* overloads *any* washing machine at *some* point) you can throw it through an extra wash or an extra rinse or whatever. That's actually kinda nice.<br /><br />The handholds were a thoughtful touch as well. As were the little hooks for the power cord and the drain hose. In fact, I really like the drain hose holder thing so that you can just hook it onto something (like a dish rack for example) and not have to worry about it flopping out of the sink. Water pressure is also low enough that it doesn't cause the hose to jerk around either.<br /><br />So, good job on the details.<br /><br />Now, how loud is it?<br />Obviously, the heavier the load-- the louder it's going to be but, so far? With a normal load, it's actually quieter than my dishwasher even when it spins. The only loud thing about it is the beep at the end of the cycle but, honestly? The beep isn't any louder than my microwave or even my instapot. In fact, it's the exact same beep as both my instapot and my dishwasher. Go figure. lol.<br />Point is that in an open concept apartment, the husband can be working his phone job in the living \"room\" area while the washing machine is in the kitchen and neither customers nor bosses on the phone can hear anything other than the beeps. (He's claiming that a dump truck is backing up outside if he forgets to hit the mute when it comes to an end.)<br /><br />Finally, how much can it wash?<br />Obviously, it's portable so it's not going to handle the same amount as a full sized machine but, otoh, it's not coin operated so you can go to town and wash whenever you want. ;)<br />Basically? I managed to get a Full sized comforter that was a bit on the thin side through with a little babysitting. Yeah, it took a little manipulating of the load partway through and two rinses but, it went through and since that's the largest item that we have in regular use, that's okay.<br />Now, I would probably prefer the coin op for it because while it came out cleaner, I can't bet my life on it coming out as absolutely clean as it can possibly be but again, right now we have a coin shortage and it really needs to be washed once a month at least-- so, we're at \"needs must\" territory when it comes to that blanket to be honest.<br />Still, point *is* that it's right on that edge so if your blanket/comforter is super thick and/or Queen sized or larger, you're still gonna have to use the laundromat for that item.<br />To be fair though, I honestly don't see how *any* portable washing machine could handle that old comforter of mine with aplomb anyway so, I'm seriously not docking them any for that.<br /><br />In short? It's wonderful. It really, really is. We don't have to \"scout\" whether or not there's a washer that's available anymore, we don't have to try to track down a bank that's still willing to give out quarters every couple of weeks (fewer and fewer branches seem to be doing that these days even before the shortage), and we don't have to avoid using the dish towels and cloth napkins either. Really, I foresee our paper towel usage go down as a result.<br /><br />So, yeah, I love this thing! I really, really do. :D<br /><br />Edit:<br />We are now into the first part of 2023 and it's still going strong.<br />Here's some more long term things that I've noticed during that time.<br />1) it is still *really* easy to overdo the soap!!!<br />I blame a lifetime of regular sized washing machines but this thing takes practically almost none.<br />2) it's also still kind of easy to try to overload it.<br />Again. I blame myself and not the machine for that.<br />Obviously, if you overlaod any machine too much or put in too much soap, you run the risk of getting those dreaded white streaks but a good trick for preventing that is to use the small, collapsable drying rack we bought as my guide because the perfect load seems to be just what that rack holds. Which is a really good guide, actually.<br />As I mentioned before though, it really isn't that big of a deal because we can easily do another load the next day. Frankly, given that by my calculations, this thing has fully paid for itself by the end of 2021 and has been actively saving us a small fortune in this last year.... I am more than okay with that. In fact, since the loads *are* so quick and easily taken care of, we have found ourselves not procrastinating on doing the laundry anymore. :D",

Nispira listed models as far back as #466 so I took a chance that the filter design hadn't changed that much from my model #458 to 466.  I was not disappointed!  The filters are excellent quality, reasonably priced, and fit the cartridge holder precisely.",

If you don't add more water the clothes do not move freely, and they snag on one another. You MUST manually add more water or you cannot do a full 10 lb load. You'll only be able to do one twin sheet at a time. When I manually add water to fill the tub, then I can do a whole set. But babysitting it is a royal PAIN!!! Maybe my machine was made wrong?<br /><br />Spin cycle: no spray during spin cycle so doesnt get a lot of soap out. You will need to do a second rinse. Or even a third.<br /><br />The belt is starting to squeak loudly on the spin cycle after 6 month's use<br /><br />Noise: The spin cycle will be heard by people living underneath you in an apartment so you'll need to set it on an appliance dolly and a rubber mat<br /><br />Moveability: wheels too small so does not move easily. Get an appliance dolly<br /><br />Drain: u-shaped attachment for drain hose does not fit over wider sink counters. I have to duct tape mine to the counter.<br /><br />Water inlet hose: way too short.<br /><br />PROS: Has good power and torque. Gets clothes very clean. Spins fast without damaging clothes. Lint trap works VERY VERY well. Great if you have pet hair!! It really gets it off!!!<br /><br />Solid metal parts and motor. Not plastic.<br /><br />Opinion: Quite a few upgrades needed like:<br /><br />1. the water level definitely needs fixing, the tub should completely fill so clothes move freely and so I can use it as it's listed at 10lb capacity.<br />2. the drain hose attachment must be made wider to go over 6\" wide USA counter tops,<br />3. Needs a spray rinse<br />4. Needs a longer attachment hose<br /><br />Overall it's a good machine. It's better than going to the laundromat.<br /><br />EDIT JANUARY 2022:<br />Machine still going strong! No issues after daily use for a year. A little drop of 3-n-1 oil on the spin belt and the belt stopped squeaking. A great solid machine. (Still too bad Inhave to manually adjust the water level, but the machine is so well made I just deal with it or wash less if a load.)",

OR drape them over a rack style dryer to finish drying. This machine saves you a TON of money. Even if you still use a washing machine this spins out more water. Now, that said, I have the 3200rpm version, and not sure what speed this one is, but the 3200 rpm large capacity spinner I bought from Laundry Alternative in 2010 is still going strong. If you think what a 4500W dryer costs in energy when you run it for 45 minutes to do a load of towels...this thing pays for itself. I Love this machine.<br /><br />The ad should tell you how many rpms it is, and it should always be twice as fast as a machine spinner or what's the point unless you do laundry by hand or with a counter top machine, then it beats wringing out items.",

The company has &#34;revamped&#34; the product with a different agitator at the bottom. The original agitator had three large, thick, inch tall rotors on it, (you can see it in one of the photos) was outstanding and torqued the water magnificently and I could put four big towels in it no problem. The new agitator is not good. (you can also see this in another of the photos. Both rotors are shown in different photos.) The newer agitator has four small rotors, with bumpy things between them. This four small rotor agitator does not torque the water as well as the three rotor agitator. The bumps between the rotors prevent the water from getting between the rotors and spinning with a large torque. Not to mention the rotors themselves are very small and don't push the water. I sent it back, because putting only two of the same towels in it caused it to stop rotating much at all.

No grounds, yes sludge, but that is to be expected with any of these reusable pods, including the one made by Keurig, if you don't use a paper filter. They simply can't make mesh any finer than this.  My solution is to not drink the last half inch of coffee in my cup.

Another 4 screws on the washer bulkhead and I had access to replace the switch & wiring. (quite a few videos on You-tube on how to do this.) It took less then an hour to do it taking my time & cleaning up washer grime & dust,etc.  I didn't purchase the high marked up $38 OEM switch but decided on this $8 switch.  Comparing both, they looked identical and wouldn't be surprised if they were made in the same factory. The switch \"clicks\"  when depressed and works properly.

The ends of both the old and new unit look the same.  However, the new one would just not stay in place if you ran water through it from the water dispenser.  I ordered and installed a new filter base and my pop-out problem was eliminated.  My refrigerator is 9 years old.

I wanted to see what problem we would have and how Samsung service stackjed up.  Well in 6 months not a single issue has been encountered.  I have three young children 12, 8 and 6 yrs of age that all use the appliance. They daily open/close the refrigerator doors, remove and place items on shelves, get ice, get water etc.  It has stood up beautifully to all real world conditions.  The refrigerator can be somewhat noisy the ice machine, sounds include: ice drop into holding bin, the compressor, and some other assorted other noises can be downright entertaining.  But not a single functional issue.  The size is wonderful. I could create a wish list that includes the desire that the shelving had some additional configuration possibilities for large bulk items, but I am nitpicking.  Wonderful addition to our family.  I highly recommend this model.  Maybe others have had problems but I can only speak from my own personal experience.  Hopefully it reflects the norm.",

    "text": "So my old venlline overhead range fan motor in my mobile home went out and I decided I'd replace the whole thing because get this . The old 1960 fan motor was 50.00! This whole brand new range was 50.00! Why replace just the motor in my old one and end up not being the motor or something else messing up on it shortly after . Why not just get a brand spanking new one for the same price of the old motor . Come on now . And I installed it myself!! I Honestly think installing this new unit was a lot easier than replacing that old fan motor would have been. This product saved me a ton of money . It's way better than that old one too. Win win win ! You can't loose with this thing . My vent size was a bit off but I just took some cardboard and cut it like a gasket to keep the vacuum right. Wiring was easy just make sure to flip the correct circuit breakers off. Only hard part about it was trying to start the screws and hold it up at the same time . Get someone to help you with that part.",

It said most likely was either these parts or dirty coils and to try the coils first.  The weird thing was my fridge was still cold, and everything I read suggested that it's the condenser coil if the fridge was still \"cold\".  So, naturally, I freaked out.  I ordered a brush to help clean the coils - but again, since the fridge was cold, figured no biggie.<br /><br />After I cleaned the coils, it was still making the noise, so then I figured, let me order these parts.  Since this combo was cheap enough, rather than trying to figure out which one of them went bad (and knowing Murphy's law), I figured I would just order both.  Usually Amazon has quicker shipping, but this time I had to wait the full 2-3 days.. and wouldn't you know it... the fridge got hot.  The fan was turning, the clicking was still occurring but now everything was spoiling.<br /><br />A few days later, the parts arrived and was a quick DIY install.  Unfortunately, the ice cream didn't make it, but the clicking has stopped, and the fridge is now working as it should.<br /><br />I have a Whirlpool Gold GX5FHDXVQ00.",

    "text": "As soon as I received it I immediately put it to try. I live in a dorm room. Kinda like a studio with a very limited kitchen space. So, buying even a small coffee machine was not an option. Before all that virus situation I was able to buy coffee at local coffee store but when it got shut down I had no source of coffee whatsoever. Desperate, for a few weeks I was trying to figure out how to stop my suffers and make my own coffee without hurting my bank account and room space I saw this portable pour over coffee filter. Bought it without any hesitations. Even though delivery was scheduled on 27th of April, I received it in as little as 4 days. I also got lucky and received my coffee at the same day. So stars aligned and in a few moments I was making coffee. In case if anyone curious, I am a huge fan of maxwell house dark roast coffee. That's the coffee I always use. The quality of brewed coffee in my opinion is even better than at Starbucks. Even though it says it is dark roast, with pour-over it gives you perfect medium roast flavor. This method is not new to me. And all the bad reviews here are due to user errors. The coffee filter will overflow if you try to rush the process. Try to find something that will help you to control the flow of hot water. Preferable a kettle with a super-thin nose. But since that was not an option for me, I was using a soft plastic cup that I saved from one of my microwaveable meals. I had hot water in another container and just put hot water in that cup by portions and slowly poured it in coffee. The main idea is to do it as slowly as possible otherwise it will run over.",

This small unit holds quite a bit and when the ice basket is full  it quits making ice.  This is a small unit great for limited space. The unit fits on a tv table tray in the kitchen so it out of the way completely. (Very convenient! I purchased this for my travel trailer so I can utilize the freezer space.  I price shopped Walmart/Kohl's/Bed Bath and Beyond/Ebay/etc.  Amazon had the best price on this particular item.<br />Only thing I would change if there was an option to keep ice frozen after being produced.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:38225654b62b7bb5f80d41c3eec3b6ef]] UPDATE: I've gotten the machine hooked up to the standard water & drain in my apartment. It took a little work & time at Lowe's,  but now everything works great.  You have to turn the water off/on where a standard washer you set to hot/cold etc, but it fills up fast so no real problems there.  Overall we're glad to have it in our apartment.<br /><br />3.5 stars. The size is great,  machine works very well.  Reasons for not giving 5 stars:<br /><br />There is no way to attach a longer drain hose without great difficulty-the hose is glued together inside,  behind the back panel.  The hose is really too short.<br /><br />The machine is pretty wobbly during use, I imagine due to all of the water & weight being on the left side during use.  I tried this out just on my kitchen table with towels underneath to see if/how everything worked, & will definitely be looking for a sturdier stand of some kind.<br /><br />I wish there was a bit more drainage pressure on the wash side,  I'm having to do multiple rinses to get out all of the soap.  If you get one of these,  use very very little soap! I used maybe a teaspoon & a bit of stain release liquid,  & it was too much.<br /><br />The box was pretty damaged, but so far I can't tell there was damage to the machine.  There really needs to be more protective packaging. However,  it did come completely assembled,  all I had to do was set it on the table. I didn't attach the water inlet hose for this testing,  I just poured in the water,  but the hose was included.<br /><br />Overall,  I'm glad to have this in my apartment,  & will definitely be using it.  It washes & spins very well.  It has enough power to tangle up any strings on your clothes,  so be ready for that. Clothes feel amazingly dry when you get them out of the spinner.",

I've kinda got it fixed by putting a rubber band around the top of the outer part of the filter. I read something on reddit about using a rubber band to fix it. I couldn't find a demonstration of how to apply the rubber band, but I assume they fixed it by putting it around the top of the outer part. Sometimes it still wants to pour water out of the top, but I usually get a pretty good cup of coffee by using this \"fix\". It seems that the Slim just doesn't want to make a tight seal around the top of the filter, so the rubber band gives it just a little boost to help seal the needle in.",

Before it arrived, I thought the filter would not be fine enough that coffee ground might go thru, but I was surprised by how good the filter is. It is really fine and the resulting cup doesn't have much grounds in it, which is really nice. The resulting cup is a bit stronger and bolder than it from chemex but not as strong as the one brewed by a french press, kind of like in between the two. No more waste to environment.

So it works as it should. Do yourself a favor do not buy plastic can save a few dollars you will not be happy even if you open your freezer only once a week they do strip out. Most people are buying a plastic one, as it was save a few dollars. The problem is most times the freezer they needing a key for is an older freezer with a worn-out lock.

So when I had to replace the original cord (It had the tip of the plug broken off) I looked for a replacement.  I saw this, and while rather expensive I decided to order it.  The new cord is a heavier gauge wire than the original, which is a good safety feature that keeps the wire from overheating and also wastes less of our battery from resistance.  It is MUCH easier to find a good place to put the cooler when you have ten feet of cord!  The only small minus is that unlike the old cord that has a straight plug, this has a 90 degree right angle.  So even if the 12v port is on the left you still have it going off to the right before you bend it over.  On a short cord this would make it harder to reach the port if it's on the wrong side.  But with this much length it just looks a bit funny...<br /><br />So, while I wish it wasn't so expensive I think it's worth it.  I wish Whynter had an option of buying the cooler with it instead of the short cord!",

I verified with Harmon that 3-00-674069 was replaced by 3-00-03000.<br /><br />The flame guide looks different than the original which was flatter.  The new design has a curved face facing the burn pot. It fits cleanly, on the burn pot, and transitions to the medallion much cleaner.  It feels like it burns better as well.  The flame is more centered in the burn pot and there is more room for the pellets to burn.  The burn pot is also much easier to clean since there is more room for the scrapper as well.<br /><br />The quality of this flame guide.  There is evidence of grinding the castings but no gaps or defects in the cast itself.  It sits on the burn pot cleanly and has no noticeable gaps.<br /><br />I included pictures of the old and new for your reference.",

Everything was fine, bearings and shocks were fine. He then saw the pads and told us that is the only think it could be. He told us those pads could mess up the bearings over time.

I managed to score one of the Whirlpool portable washers for dirt cheap. It's about twice the size and weight of the Haier, and is about the same size as my portable dishwasher. It's only a little louder than the Haier even though the motor is so much better, but not much and I really only hear it during the spin cycle in my small duplex. There's a loud 'click' when the cycle finishes, no beeps or anything, which I rather like.<br /><br />Protip: It's a high efficiency unit, and low or no suds detergent should be used. Regular laundry soap will gunk up everything in side rather quickly. Also, Whirlpool sells a stacking unit for this, so if you have the Whirlpool compact electric dryer, it can be mounted above this washer if space is a premium, but you lose mobility because it's awkward to wheel around like that.<br /><br />I've had no problem with the spin or pump, mine works fine on all cycles. I love everything about this machine. The little cup that holds the powdered detergent is set up so the incoming water goes right through it, dissolving it before it gets onto the laundry, so no more blotchy messes.<br /><br />My only 'druther' is that I wish it had a dedicated rinse or spin cycle. While you can interrupt a regular cycle by lifting the lid (because it won't operate at all if the lid is up) it would just be nice if there was a dedicated cycle for it for those times when I'm washing a super absorbent load, like sweaters, so I could do an additional rinse to be sure all the soap is out.",

It sits on top of all my coffee cups no problem (I ordered the medium) and there's plenty of room for tea.  I like that the handles don't get hot.  The top does not twist on - it sits on top of the container - so it can't be immersed if that's your plan.  For some reason the color I ordered was under $10.00 whereas other colors were over $20.00 so I would suggest pricing out the colors (unless you're stuck on having a certain color of course).  The one I purchased was sold and shipped by Amazon; surprisingly Amazon did a horrible job at packaging this - the strainer was in its packaging (a flimsy cardboardy box) which was crammed in a manila envelope. So the box was very crushed and I was surprised that the strainer  was not damaged but the box was beyond repair to store the strainer in.  But that's my only negative and not a reflection on the product (in fact I guess it shows that the product is fairly durable) so I left it at 5 stars.",

It installs in a few seconds and you have to run a large quantity of water through before regular use.  The water tastes fine through the filter but I don't have any fancy testing equipment besides my taste buds to determine if it is highly effective.  It is less expensive than the normal Whirlpool brand filters so that is a win in my book.<br /><br />I will probably continue to reorder this filter because I've not had any issues and I don't want to endure the stress of finding another filter.",
