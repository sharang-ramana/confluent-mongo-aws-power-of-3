They do make it easy to pull out the grounds from your insert, but once they are wet, they edges are hard to grab up. Definitely wait until it has cooled a second or two before grabbing it. Also, it limits the amount of coffee you can actually put in the insert. After you start buying the inserts (plastic, stainless steel..etc), the cups for the inserts, etc...  I keep wondering if I should just go back to buying the Kcups.  It's still a bit cheaper, even with these paper liners so then I guess it comes down to if you want to do the 2 second kcup or spend a minute or two filling your insert.  A personal choice for everyone to make.",

For about the price of a pack of 2 of the brand name filters, I got 12.  I am sure they will work perfectly for my use.  I will update if there are any issues.  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in very good condition.  I will also note that they are all individually wrapped.  Another bonus.  If you need these kidney shaped water filters for your coffee maker, I would recommend trying these for the price alone.",

It doesn't quite fit my refrigerator, but it does cover the area where the drips usually land. The width is nearly perfect. It's just not as deep as the area. There are 4 pads which is more than I need. I think 2 would be enough so I could have one under the water hose and one in the laundry.",

He told the staff and a few days later he received 2 new pairs of pajama pants, but they weren't as soft and comfortable as his old, missing ones. Now he's back in his assisted living center and I plan to label all of his clothes. He hasn't had any problems at his place, but it's better to be prepared. These labels are pretty small. The whole package is pretty small and I almost missed it. It came in a box with other items so I didn't notice it at first. I tested it out on a couple of pieces of my own clothing. I used both a regular ball point pen on one and a fine tip Sharpie on the other. I was impressed that neither of them smeared, even after touching the ink right after writing on it. I affixed the stickers to the labels of the clothing items. After being laundered, they looked practically the same. These are great!! Perfect for kids at daycare, camp, and the elderly!",

This counter top ice maker will hopefully make life easier. We set this up and followed the directions. It didn't take long before we started making ice. It is a slow process. It took about 2 hours to fill the ice basket. This isn't something you can just start doing to get a lot of ice right away. However, if you plan in advance, it should be fine. We will start making ice the night before it's needed then bag it up and put it in the freezer. I love that this maker recycles the melted water. That's a great idea! While it is noisy, it's more of a white noise than anything else. We found it to not be distracting. We like the shapes of the ice cubes. My husband thought it would be nice if the front of the maker was see through so you could see how much ice you have without having to peer down into it. Overall, this works well and makes decent ice cubes.",

The older half size refrigerator has plastic shelves and when you put a lot of weight on the shelves, it has shown signs of cracking and bowing. Not the case with this refrig. I have filled it with a mix of beer and sparkling tall/slim cans. I might be able to get a couple more cans in there, but I think it's pretty close to capacity.

This allows him the convenience of using the Esperta with his own coffee. These work well in our machine. You do have to make sure you line up the little hole correctly when you insert it into the machine. The directions explain how fine or coarse the coffee needs to be for using it. It comes with a spoon and brush. We used to have a Tassimo machine and there were not any reusuable pods that worked with it, so I am pleased that we found these. I'm excited to be able to use some nice flavored coffee beans. I love that these cut down on trash, too! **Update 5/21/2017 - I am still using these and still like them. However, I did want to add something to my review. They don't come out of the pod holder very easily. I usually have to turn the holder upside down and tap it slightly to get it to come out. When doing that, that sometimes dislodges the little filter screen. I didn't realize that it had come out one time and I threw it in the trash with the coffee grounds. Now that I know that can happen, I make sure that it's still there. And if it has come dislodged, I make sure to find it before I throw out the grounds. It's easy to put back in - it just snaps in place. I didn't realize it was even missing until I made coffee the next time with that pod and my coffee was full of grounds! Just wanted to share that.",

You have the option of choosing from dozens of different stove models which gives the impression your set will be cut to fit the specific-sized burners on your specific model stove while protecting other areas of the stove top - not so!<br /><br />Instead, these \"protectors\" are apparently made to fit various STYLES of stoves. For example, our style  stove has two burners on each side and a griddle in the center, so we were sent two side panels, each with two holes, and a center panel with one hole. That is where the \"custom\" aspect of this product ends, because the sizes of the holes are waaaay bigger in diameter than the burners, leaving large areas of our stove top (ironically, areas highly likely to receive spills) unprotected. Additionally, some areas of the protectors' borders are so narrow that any spilled food might as easily land on the stove top as on the protectors.<br /><br />The fact that the seller does not pay for return shipping makes me to believe they do not back up their product (our local post office told us that although the package is super light--which would normally qualify for 1st class shipping--this item's oversized packaging requires it be returned via Priority shipping, costing nearly $11).<br /><br />Bottom line: this would be a great product if were made by company with the desire to do the job right.",

I like the filters, and I find that they eliminate most of the stray coffee grounds.  I find that some coffee grounds do escape the filter, though there is a secondary filter that catches them.  In the meantime, these little filters make it easier to clean the primary filter.  Therefore, I do recommend them and will buy more when I run out of these.",

It's obvious when my builder build my home that<br />He made the space for my stove too wide, as I didn't want the build-ins.<br />The cover is almost like a thicker type of cardboard material that does bend, but does not lay flat like silicone, or clean as easy like the Silicone side strips that come with this set does, that I actually just bought another set about a week before his Order For a rental house  I have.<br /><br />I cook for my family everyday since Covid 2 yrs ago,  and usually take my 3 large heavy creates off and clean my stove top after dinner.  Since this doesn't fit well on my stove top It's more of a hassle using this, or I have to get use to it and the Benefits of it.<br />As I said , If it would have been the silicone like the strips are that I was expecting this would be, as they also stay in place better I would be using that.",

The 3-1/2\" x 3\" monitor has a built-in stand, and a large, clear readout.  Beneath the display screen is a printed \"key\" that explains the ranges of relative humidity:  0% to 30% is too dry (dry eyes, nose & throat); 30% to 50% is the comfort zone (healthy breathing); and 50% to 85% is too humid for everyday (best for coughs & colds).<br /><br />Out of the box, the monitor took a few hours to display the correct room temperature, but it now agrees with the changing readings displayed by a couple of other devices in the same room.  More importantly, the relative humidity display is totally consistent with the automatic  humidity settings on my new whole-room humidifier.  I purchased this monitor because I didn't completely trust the humidifier's automatic sensor, which is probably too close to a furnace vent.  Now this monitor tells me when the humidifier should be turned on or off.",

I can get 100 of these type filters for $3.42.  Nevertheless, these work as designed and are a perfect coffee filter option.<br /><br />I attached before and after photos. Note that I didn't realize my unit is more basket type so I should not have used a cone filter; this is why you see the filter below the rim. However, if I had a cone basket it would be at the rim.<br /><br />I like these filters but they are pricey. The price is the ONLY reason I rated them 4 stars.",

    "text": "01/23 update: trying a different brand of lids when I ran out… I came back SO FAST!! Others failed me miserably!!! TBH, I was surprised to see any had issue using these- as these have single-handedly saved my coffee budget. If you take a minute to do the steps- truly, it can work like a charm!<br /><br />Finally- A fix to the costly pod price for Nespresso coffee maker! Not only does the “have to use pod“ cost a pretty penny.. but, they limit the ability to try different options in your coffee maker.. and limit any ability to go green. That's a lot of control for one tiny appliance to have!! (IMHO!)<br /><br />Most important thing to know- SAVE YOUR OLD NEPRESSO PODS.. you NEED these in order to use these lids!! Every pod is marked with a barcode -hence the reason no other pod will work! This item is just the sealable aluminum foil top that lets you cover over up a refilled Nespresso pod. So, you must hold onto used pods in order to use this option. TBH, this was something I didnt realize when ordering..!!<br /><br />After cleaning, rinsing and drying your used pods 100%- you refill with the coffee of choice. **OK, this is where the foil lids come in! Carefully place the sealable purchased lid atop of pod.. BE SURE NOT TO OBSCURE THE BAR CODE FOUND ON SIDE..!! Foil is a tad bigger in diameter then pod cup itself- so it gives a bit of forgiveness when putting it on! DONT BE INTIMIDATED- I actually found prepping a handful at one time helps to find a rhythm and make things less of hassle vs. filling x1 every morning!! Coffee grounds stay fresh inside the sealed pod. Once shut these will store in whatever method you usually use- box, basket, display rack etc. all with the same fit.. the cute outer prints are a fun aesthetic! But, these designs are actually a way to differentiate between what you chose to fill the pod with. For example if using cappuccino = sunburst, decaf = stripes, etc. you have total of 4 designs.<br /><br />Hack: setting a roll of T.P. tipped tube side up- is a solid way to balance pod while adhering the new lid.. I know, sounds crazy but it steadies it for you!! See photo to show what I mean-<br /><br />Sorry so long winded- wanted to help others avoid any confusion. A great option for variety while  saving both money and planet! Hoping info can help your decision.. stay safe everyone.",

For the others it is very nice, cradling each egg on a little springy platform and held by the single sized walls.  Truly it would be better if all eggs were covered in this solution, but it does hold a lot of smaller and medium eggs.<br /><br />I'm not sure if we will start to religiously use the date slider.  We did mark our first eggs with it, but we tend to cycle through the eggs pretty quickly either through cooking or gifting so date stamping may not be needed.  It should clean reasonably well and we did run it through the dishwasher before initial use.  Love how it stacks in the fridge.  All in all we are pretty happy.",

    "text": "The ice maker in the office has been broken for a couple of years, and when there was ice it was gathered up by one or two individuals so there wasn't any available anyway. I selected this ice maker for use in my office for my own use (with my office mates). This ice maker proved itself on the very first day it was used.<br /><br />This ice maker is about the size of a coffee maker - a little shorter, a little wider. It doesn't require a lot of space on the counter and finding a place to put it should be easy in all but the tightest of spaces.<br /><br />Operation is simple. Pour in the water and power it on, and the ice maker does the rest. It stops when it runs out of water and it stops when it runs out of room for ice cubes. Ice gets dumped in a little basket in the top so it's all contained and easy to get out.<br /><br />We turned it on, and we were all floored by how quiet this thing runs. It is quieter than a refrigerator when it is running. It does make a little noise when it dumps the ice cubes, but it isn't loud at all when it does that - again quieter than the ice maker in a refrigerator.<br /><br />There are two size settings - large and small. So far, we have only used the large setting.<br /><br />One thing we have observed about it is that the first couple of ice cube dumps produce smaller, thinner ice cubes. Once the ice maker has been running for 20-30 minutes the ice gets thicker.<br /><br />The ice comes out wet, as to be expected, very much like ice cream comes out of an ice cream maker very soft. This isn't a problem and is normal but if you have not worked with an ice maker like this in the past it can come as a surprise.<br /><br />And... This ice maker is fast! We had ice within 10 minutes of plugging it in and turning it on. It produces cubes a little faster than once every 10 minutes, and in about an hour the tray is getting close to full. I have not tried filling the reservoir and seeing how long it takes to run out of water.<br /><br />So far, all of us are very pleased with this ice maker. It works quietly and quickly, it's not too big, and it's easy to keep in an office where ice is otherwise hard to come by.",

It's really amazing.<br />I learned right away to load the clothes exactly as instructed, otherwise the load is not balanced & the machine wobbled/walks & makes a racket. Once I understood exactly how to load it, it runs whisper-quiet & does not wobble or move during operation.<br />There is a safety lock button which must b pushed to open the top. The lid must be closed & locked to engage the on/off slide bar. The cord is heavy duty with a grounded plug. The drain spout is at a good height & sticks out far enough to easily slide a standard square dish washing bucket under it. It works great with a good quality collapsing bucket, as well. There are recessed side grip handles the make it easy to move.<br />Excellent product.",

    "text": "I was so excited to use this for cold brew since I love so many OXO products, but this was a disappointment. I've been making cold brew in a French press until now, and I have been pleased with the results, but since it requires hands on filtering, I thought this OXO system would simplify the filtering and allow the machine to do most of the work. Wrong.<br />With a French Press, once the coffee has brewed, I can press the coffee and separate most of the grounds from the cold brew. Then I slowly pour it out into a mesh filter lined with a paper filter and wait for it to slowly seep through. I have to change the paper filter half way through before pouring the second half.<br />With this OXO system, you are supposed to be able to flip the switch and the cold brew will drip down in to the glass carafe below. But the grounds kept clogging the filter and then absolutely no liquid could get through. (I will also note that I have a quality conical burr grinder, so the grind should not be an issue.) I had to stand over it for about 15 min scraping the grounds to the side or scooping spoonfuls of grounds out of the brewing container. After 15 minutes of this, we were left with roughly 2/3 of the volume of cold brew we would have gotten from the same recipe in a French press. The reduced volume was partially due to me scooping grounds out of the way and throwing them in the sink, and partially because there was no way to effectively press the liquid out of the grounds. Also the taste was inferior. Again probably because the most concentrated cold brew couldn't be pressed out of the grounds.<br />Overall the taste was nowhere as good and the process was more cumbersome than a French press. I wish I loved this machine, but on the plus side, it's one less thing to sit on my counter and take up more space in the fridge.",

Takes small amount of detergent, (or softener); operates by turning a level to spin tub around on its stand.  Instructions provided which suggest minutes to spin, alternating front & back spins, based on load size.<br /><br />If your wash load is only lightly dirty you can remove that load and put aside for rinsing and place another load in your Laundry Alternative and proceed with washing process in the same detergent.  This will save on your water bill and detergent as well.<br /><br />Following the washing cycle I use a spin machine that removes excess water; therefore, eliminating having to use hands to squeeze water out of each piece.<br /><br />Time it takes clothes to dry after hanging up is surprisingly short, especially on a sunny day.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy your new Laundry Alternative as much as I do!

The first filter of the 3 pack we just bought started leaking 8 days after installation, flooding the lower refrigerator and started filling up the bottom door freezer. Luckily for us we noticed the water running down into the freezer it before it started to spill out into the kitchen. We installed the 2nd filter hoping the first was just a defective part and just replaced the 2nd filter this evening, 5 days later. It was leaking just like the first filter, not massive amounts but a slow leak that unchecked would have flooded the whole refrigerator again. We have installed the 3rd filter which is holding for now but have also ordered Samsung OEM replacements and will not try &#34;compatible&#34; replacements ever again. It's very apparent when the comparing the mating features of the OEM filter and this replacement, there's a enough of a difference that makes this filter a less than ideal replacement for the DA29-00020B. If they work for you, great, but for our Samsung refrigerator, it was a waste of money.",

It was VERY easy to slip onto the retaining clips, it heated perfectly, immediately, and 100% to temperature. I'm elated. THIS grandma did it herself and is very happy to have use of the oven back!! Oh, and the price... Great!!! Repair professionals wanted $150. just to come out and do the easy labor. Thank you for making this available!",

Understand, everyone whines about doing laundry, how it is never ending, blah blah blah. I do laundry 350 days a year @ an average of 5 loads a day. My Whirlpool has given me 7000+  loads of dry clothes since I bought it, so when the starting stopped, I chalked it up to 'it was her time'. Problem is I literally do not have the funds for a new dryer, any brand/any size. So I was determined to figure out what was wrong. YouTube, of course, had several decent 11+ minute videos. Does someone who washes/dries/folds/puts away 5 loads of laundry in addition to all the other 'life' have time to sift through all these videos? Maybe. But patience is something I can promise I don't have - lol. So I turned to TikTok and after literally weeks of searching (THANK GOD MY PARENTS LIVE NEXT DOOR AND HAVE AN AMAZING KENMORE DRYER 🙌🏻) I found a video by creator @AleciaAppliance that in less than 1 minute showed me how to diagnose, prepare, what to order and how to repair my dryer. (She said it was the issue 99% of the time.) Ordered the parts and within 15 minutes I had my dryer back in service. Time will tell how long this part lasts but at ≈$3.50 each, I'll take what I can get compared to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars.",

Dishes were still dirty after every wash/dry cycle combo I tried. Like a few others, I dug up multiple YouTube videos to try to find a 'fix' for what was - upon watching enough videos - a bad circulation pump. My model, according to the videos that were by parts sellers, only sold the entire motor pump/assembly. If I had $300 for that, I'd have $500 for a new dishwasher. Which is probably what Whirlpool wants ya to do.  Greedy bass turds.  I rebelled and washed dishes... 4 hours a day total for over a month (special needs kid + elderly parents next door, I cook a lot for a lot of people). Casting 'stank eye' at my Whirlpool brand cabinet-hole-place-holder every so often. Finally, after I had had enough, I caved and bought this part. It was a pain to install for my Dad - I could tell by how much he fussed when I didn't point the flashlight in the right spot (he's 76 and worked HARD all his life... he's entitled!) - and I think some of that was neither of us could recall, over a month after we took the old one off, how it was supposed to be installed. He did finally, with the help of more YouTubes, get it back on... and it leaked. Not significantly, I'd say about half to one cup max of water per cycle. Still, there's electricity under there... you don't want any leakage. A few days later he pulled it back out, gently flipped it over, pulled this new circulation pump off (I had figured out sorta where the leak was coming from... BUY THE BLACK GASKETY THINGY THAT COSTS $32ish THAT 'OTHERS ALSO BUY' [per Amazon]) and he used clear silicone caulk I had on hand to 'seal' the black part of the circulation pump, where it goes into a black sleeve-y part on the dishwasher, before reinstalling. No more leaks! This might not be a 5⭐️ aftermarket, off brand replacement but for the price - if you're fortunate enough to have help or you, yourself,  know what you're doing... it's more than worth the money to get this circulation pump.",

I read the reviews (laffed at some) and decided to try it.  I have used it 4 times so far,  A-mazing.  My utility room is good sized and if it gets too warm (with door closed), I just open the garage door about 3\" and let the heat escape, but with the cold temps we've had lately, I just leave the utility door open and it's fine.  It's not a hot heat, just warm.  It was easy to install.  Kudos for whoever thought of this.  THANKS.<br /><br />**UPDATE:  Late November I ordered the 6 pk refill for the filters, they are great.. I cleaned after 3-4 loads and the 2 that came with the vent kit lasted all this time, and I do a good deal of laundry.  I love this system..",

A humidifier is the key to solving this problem and so I turned to this humidifier from Vycol for the relief my daughter needed.<br /><br />With this humidifier, you get digital accuracy and control. This is one of its best features. You can set it for the exact level of humidity you prefer. It will then keep the air at that level of humidity. It has a timer, too, which is good for my daughter. She can make sure it is off when she is not in the room.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this humidifier is that you can visibly see the mist. With others I have used, the amount of moisture added to the air is too slight to visibly see it. With this humidifier, you can see the moisture shooting out from the top. And for a small bedroom, it adds moisture to the air quickly. You need to be careful not to set it too high for that reason. It adds humidity to a room rather quickly and it doesn't make much noise.<br /><br />A little moisture in the air is necessary for some people. This table top humidifier from Vycol certainly does its job, as promised. You can control it and set it the way you like. It adds moisture to a room quickly and efficiently and it looks better than other humidifiers. It earns an enthusiastic recommendation from me.",

    "text": "We have issues with our ice maker in our refrigerator. It is far too slow to produce ice and we have considered getting another refrigerator because of it. We usually just buy bags of ice to solve the problem, but for convenience sake, I decided to get this Frigidaire ice maker.<br /><br />Compact in size, this ice maker sits on the countertop and produces just enough ice to make it useful for beverages and other modest needs. You just open the flip top, pour in water, and wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the first batch of cubes of ice to be made. The small cubes are bell/gumdrop shaped and are small enough to fit in tight spaces, making them good for those who want to add ice to, say, water bottles and other receptacles that cannot handle normal sized ice cubes.<br /><br />The outside of this ice maker has lights that indicate Ice Full, Add Water, and Ice Making. The top two indicators display a red light, to get your attention The one annoyance I have with this ice maker is that the ice tends to stack up in the back, which triggers the sensor and causes the ‘Ice Full' light to come on. There could, in fact, be plenty of space in the ice bin and you will need to open, pull the ice down from the back, and close to make the ice maker resume. The problem is that the ice is dumped in back and stacks up on the back edge. A change to the engineering- having it dump the ice in the middle of the ice container, for example- would fix this problem.<br /><br />Other than that, this Frigidaire ice maker works well and produces the necessary ice to use in beverages for my family of four. It takes up little space and you can easily flip open the lid to get the ice you need. It's a good investment for those who have a faulty ice maker in the fridge and who are tired of making regular trips to the store to purchase bags of ice.",

    "text": "Drying clothes is something we take for granted and we expect our clothes dryer to get our clothing dry the first time, without the need for running another drying cycle. We expect clothing to emerge from the dryer in the same condition it went in and if our dryer can keep wrinkling to a minimum, then we have an added bonus and a dryer that is certainly worth keeping. This is exactly what you get with this Amana Electric Dryer, my newest home appliance.<br /><br />My dryer installation took a little longer than expected because I could not figure out exactly which local carrier was going to deliver the dryer, due to a missed phone call and phone number problem. A call to the helpful personnel at JB Hunt was all it took to locate the whereabouts of the dryer and schedule a delivery day. The delivery people arrived as promised, installed the new dryer in a flash, and hauled the old one away. I was now ready to test my new dryer and I wasted no time loading up the washer in preparation.<br /><br />Looking at this Amana dryer for the first time, my initial impression was that it didn't have many features.  As you can see from the image on this product page, there are only two knobs: One on the left for the drying cycles and one on the right to start the operation. With only two knobs, the dryer has a very basic appearance, but once you check further, you realize that the single knob on the left includes a total of eleven different drying cycles, including auto dry cycles, wrinkle control, and a timed option. There is no end of cycle signal option and it lacks some of the other more sophisticated features found on the more expensive dryers, but it still has what you need to get the laundry dry.<br /><br />Testing a few loads, I found that the Amana Electric Dryer Model NED4600YQ excels at drying! It dries things very quickly and I was surprised when I went back to check a load of laundry that had been set for 50 minutes, only to find the clothing already dry in just 30 minutes. I realize that my previous dryer was approaching five years of age, but this still surprised me that a large load would be dry and ready to go so quickly. Subsequent tests produced the same results- loads of laundry, regardless of the type of items, dried very fast.<br /><br />Another issue I have wih dryers is with shirts. I have to remember to remove them from the dryer quickly to avoid wrinkling and since almost every short I own is cotton, this is a major problem. Thankfully, this dryer has a wrinkle control setting that tumbles the clothing without heat, helping to prevent wrinkles. It doesn't work perfectly, but it works well enough that I don't need to race to the dryer at the end of a cyle to remove clothing and I don't have to reach for an iron.<br /><br />This Amana dryer has a side- swinging door that opens from the left and swings to the right, so it won't work for certain confined spaces. I know that some people prefer the dryer doors that open from the middle and pull down, but the sideways option is fine with me. I just place a basket underneath and scoop out all of the clothing at once. Wrinkles are not much of a concern thanks to the wrinkle control and clothing is dry and ready to wear in a very short time.<br /><br />Dryers are something most of us take for granted, but some are better than others and the Amana Electric Dryer model NED4600YQ is one of the better models of dryer for getting clothing dry in reasonable time. The auto dry function doesn't always work perfectly and the wrinkle control function won't stop every wrinkle, but this is still a very good appliance even if it does lack some of the bells and whistles common with the more high- end clothes dryers.",

I thought it was a standard V-80 size, which it is not, it's smaller. It has several holes in the bottom and a flatter bottom than I was anticipating. It can be argued that this makes a better pour, but frankly I have never had good luck with these types of filters.

As you can see from the photo after 24 hours the salt test proved that these are both inaccurate.  One read 73% (not too bad) the other read 70% (way off).  You do get what you pay for. I was hoping to be able to re calibrate them after I found out what the actual humidity level it was reading but according to the company all you do is take out the batteries and put them back in again!  I did do this before I administered the test.  Please be aware that you should do a salt test to see how far these are off. I wouldn't necessarily recommend these since in some cases knowing the humidity within 1% can be extremely important for some people.  You should be able to calibrate them as well.",

    "text": "We've owned this refrigerator for 16 months and it is by far the best refrigerator we have ever owned. It does what you would expect from a $3,000 refrigerator like keeping everything cold but we are extremely pleased that it doesn't have any of the problems we've had with other refrigerators like Samsung. It is extremely quiet which is important to us since it's located in a kitchen/living room combination room—the Samsung we had before was at times so loud we had to turn up the volume on the living room TV. It makes an abundance of ice cubes without freezing them into clumps and jamming the dispenser and it dispenses ice without it flying everywhere. The ice tray is easy to access and remove. The middle drawer is spacious for storing drinks and having ready access to other regular use items like cheese, cold cuts and yogurt. The door-in-door is great for quickly grabbing items without having to open the main compartment—we use it for eggs, butter, creamer, salad dressing and water and wine carafes. The bottom freezer is large with an upper drawer and lower compartment. The French doors and middle and freezer drawers are a bit heavy so it takes a little more than a gentle push to close them but that's a minor issue considering how great the refrigerator performs.",

    "text": "I purchased this to brew stronger coffee, like most of you.  However, it has certainly taken the convenience and ease out of the single cup brewing process....with all the prep and trickery and cleaning and leaking and ...what not.<br /><br />I am a mechanical design engineer/manufacturing engineer familiar with designing parts from metal and plastic injection molded products, like the gray base and the mating gray screw-on cover.<br /><br />The problem with any machined or molded parts/assemblies is tolerances, especially with plastic injection-molded products.  There is a &#34;recipe&#34; for such molded parts when filling the mold with hot flowing &#34;liquid&#34; plastic quickly....it's time and temperature dependant.  Each run of manufacturing the My K Cup can be slightly different in dimensions by a few mere thousandths of an inch...creating a &#34;gap&#34; when the assembly is used.  Possibly...<br /><br />In the My K Cup design, there are multiple interfaces where loose or out-of-spec tolerances can cause a problem...ie, the thickness of the filter basket is dimension x.xxx&#34;, and there exists the gap between the gray base and the gray cover of x.xxx&#34; when assembled.  if all these dimensions and tolerances do not provide a leak-proof seal, there is a good chance the pressurized water will flow up to the cap and over the rim of the basket filter flange....and taking coffee grinds down into your cup.<br /><br />I have tried all the solutions listed on so many good reviews (and used some of them below)....however, besides being a chore, I still got a different strength cup of coffee.  Today, I finally realized what the solution to this problem is---it's missing a compliant gasket to eliminate any dimensional shortcomings between the dimensions of the flanged threads on the base and the cover, and the thickness of the flange on the filter basket, etc.<br /><br />so I decided to take some aluminum foil from the roll and create a seal to accommodate for any possible tolerance issues.  I pulled out about 4 inches of aluminum foil, and folded it in half.  now I had a piece of foil measuring 2 inches by 12 inches long, but 2x thick.  I then cut 2&#34;x2&#34; squares to cover just more than the diameter of the filter basket diameter.  I also poked a hole in the center for those three fins found on the underside of the gray cover to allow for the hot water to enter the filter basket.  Basically, I've replicated the foil found on original K-Cup design, but without the adhesive seal.  Guess what?  It worked!!  Finally, no trimming of old K-Cups, no reusing old K-Cups...which may or may not be a health concern as others have mentioned.<br /><br />so to make it hopefully more simple to follow, here's what I did, which includes hints and tips from many other commenters.<br /><br />1) remove the rubber gasket/o-ring from the puncturing needle from the head of the unit, place a #10 stainless steel washer on the post, and carefully place the rubber gasket/o-ring back onto the post in the same orientation as it was before you removed it.  This will keep the rubber gasket/o-ring from sliding back up the post.<br />2) grind coffee or coffee beans to a fine grind.  5-10 seconds in the small coffee bean grinder.  too fine will allow fine coffee particles thru the screen...<br />3) place filter basket into gray base (i used a tall shot glass to hold the gray base during this process)<br />4) fill the filter basket 75% and lightly tamp down<br />5) prepare the 2 ply aluminum foil square so it's 2&#34; x 2&#34; square and place atop the filter basket<br />6) fold aluminum squares around the edge of the basket and gray base<br />7) while holding aluminum square in place, puncture center of foil with something to create about a 1/4&#34; hole.<br />8) screw the gray cover onto the base.  (Note, this can be tricky if the foil is on the threads between the gray base and gray cover...but it's not a steep learning curve...you'll get the hang of it.)<br /><br />so having done this, i anxiously pressed start...and FINALLY, I got a good strong cup of coffee with freshly ground Starbucks French Roast!  the only grinds in my mug was the too-finely ground coffee.  I have to get that grind time down better...or learn to live with leaving 1/8&#34; of basically cold coffee at the end of my cup of morning Joe...<br /><br />Kerig...perhaps you can add a permanent gasket to the underside of the cover?  I would think then you have this common complaint eliminated.",

Like the two other reviewers I received my maker as a review sample.<br /><br />Operationally this is fairly economical since it draws about two hundred Watts (two old style light bulbs.) I do want to set expectations. This will absolutely produce the claimed 26.5 pounds of ice in a twenty-four hour period, but not all at once. Per cycle it will produce a little less than two pounds. A cycle takes up to twenty plus minutes, depending on the ice size that you select. The smaller ice is made a little faster than the largest of the three different 'cube' sizes. Moreover, this will only store a single cycle's worth of cubes, so if you are using it at a party it will require some management of the completed cubes as well as refilling the maker (it takes 2.8 liters of water per cycle.)<br /><br />The unit is compact and has a few basic operating requirements, like ensuring that the side vents are not blocked. Also, it is not designed for outdoors use, so factor that in if you are purchasing this for a pool party or BBQ.<br /><br />What it does do, though, is efficiently product ice on a nearly continuous basis as long as you manually transfer the finished ice to insulated coolers as well as keep the reservoir filled between cycles. In that respect the performance is very impressive, and each load of ice is substantial. I am estimating that one of these can easily keep a party of twenty supplied in ice for drinks. Plus, when you factor in the low energy consumption that I cited above this makes an excellent personal  ice maker.",

    "text": "This is one organizational container I didn't know I wanted until I recently saw it on YouTube.<br /><br />We originally had a container that had a separate lid on top, but I always had to take the lid off to get to the eggs. Also, it wasn't useful to store anything on top of the container. I always needed two hands since I had to take the container out of the fridge. I finally stopped using it because it just didn't seem practical.<br /><br />This pullout drawer container is the perfect solution for me. The carton of 18 extra-large eggs I bought today fit in this container perfectly. The drawer pulls in and out smoothly.<br /><br />The plastic it is made from is quite sturdy and BPA-free. The container is easy to take apart and clean.<br /><br />Some reviewers said there is nothing to catch the drawer and they were afraid they would pull the eggs out accidentally and spill them.<br /><br />There is a very slight edge on mine, but  frankly…I'm pretty careful with my eggs. I think just being aware they are delicate like any time you would handle an egg carton is good enough for me.<br /><br />I did put little rubber bumpers on the bottom on my container to help keep it from sliding around. I put bumpers on lots of things and always have a supply on hand.<br /><br />I am thinking that, as I use up my eggs, I may just keep pulling them forward every so often, so I don't have to pull the drawer out all the way. That should help balance what is stored in there. Also when adding new eggs, they should go in the back.<br /><br />Still thinking about how to note the expiration date. A dry erase marker might work or a removable label. I guess you can even write one of the eggs with a sharpie.<br /><br />I love how I can see how many eggs are in there, so I can tell when I am close to running out. Sometimes I buy more eggs when I don't need them so this should help me keep better track.<br /><br />I think this is a great value and quality and will be buying a second one so I can stack it on the other one (also with rubber feet). This will help me store eggs more efficiently, since egg cartons often come in different size cartons and brands.<br /><br />I am very pleased, since I love organizing and love a tidy fridge.",

    "text": "The product arrived well packaged. It looks the same as the picture.<br /><br />I got this because after years of not drinking coffee but only occasionally - I didn't want to invest in a machine again. I had been off coffee for a few years but ran my k-type machine every few months for an occasional cup.  I never got much value from the k machine for last few years.  I cleaned it religiously with vinegar of commercial cleaner but all three machines I had failed pretty quickly.  When this last one died I said enough.  I had not been happy with the lukewarm result from all of them.  I like my coffee (when I have it) strong and HOT.  BUT all three machines I had tried produced barely more than room temp beverage.<br /><br />So, I knew you could open the cups and use with a filter with boiling water over a mug.  And I was surprised at the great cup of hot coffee I got from a kcup that was ages old even.  So I got new coffee in can and then purchased this.  At first it was so so with the filters from my old mr coffee even (I actually use those filters for making ghee) and I finally broke down and purchased proper pour over filters for it  and what a difference. This is a nice product and I can only imagine what it is like with fresh ground beans but my coffee drinking is still sporadic and not worth that kind of grinding effort.",

    "title": "Works good - drain hose lasted 22 months",
    "text": "I have done about ten small loads in this machine and am happy with it so far.  I previously owned and reviewed the Wonder Wash manual washer and although I was very happy with it for a year, the hand cranking was getting a little difficult for me as was awkwardly having to drain into a bucket due to the side it drained on.<br /><br />In fact, the Wonder Wash is faster - you only have to crank for a few minutes to get an effective level of cleaning of a much longer cycle on this machine. Wonder Wash uses less water and would appear to be gentler on clothes.  It is similar to comparing a front loading machine's action (Wonder Wash) to a top loading machine (Panda Washer).<br /><br />But again.  Panda does the work so you don't have to.<br /><br />It arrived with no damage.  Having to remove the plastic protective film from the top required having to unclip the top handle to get it all out rather than leave pieces of film.  Then I saw the drain hose set up that many have written about.  Remembering the review where they said the fastening loop was too close to the end of the drain tube I noticed that and moved the fastening loop lower on the tube to keep slack out of it and raise its end higher so water would not slosh out during the wash.  And there is the rub - this tube is a rather rigid plastic, a type of plastic I have often had crack on me on other appliances (vacuum, carpet cleaner) at the bend.  I would not want to put such stress on the bend tightly all the time so during storage I used a twist tie to have the tube more relaxed but still hanging up. This is really something their design people should take into account and use a more flexible type of plastic or even rubber.  Something that can be easily replaced too.  I would think if I disassembled I would find it attached to some fitting in a manner that it can be removed, hopefully it is not cemented.  I would not want to junk a machine of this cost for a 25 cent plastic hose cracking.<br /><br />The other issue would be the odd smell. One reviewer had mentioned something smoking with heavy/frequent loads and I don't think mine is anything like that.  There is a rather pronounced plasticy smell when it is working, even with cold water so it is not coming from the tub.  I initially thought maybe just excess oil around the motor burning off (but it really isn't smoky).  Could be motor sits on something that stinks when it gets warm.  I don't know, I think it is getting a little better with time.  The odor starts almost as soon as the machine does so I really doubt it has anything at all to do with overworking it.  If it persists I might try contacting customer service.<br /><br />So far I have washed almost everything I did in my Wonder Wash except for sheets.  I could do one queen fitted or flat in that - summer weight.  I would think I could do the same in this.  That is really the limit for my countertop spinner too so is fine with me.  I have done a pair of jeans without issue with a t-shirt or two in there too.  I do 6-9 minute washes because I don't really want to beat up my clothes and they are generally not heavily soiled. I do 2-3 min rinses (two of them) and spray water in as well as it drains with my shower massager.  I also fill it with the shower massage, I have not tried the little fill hose so cannot comment on it though I am eying it as an extension for my countertop spinner's drain hose.<br /><br />I give the Panda Washer a thumbs-up but I have not relegated my Wonder Wash to the garage.  And may very well use that for washing my long lace window panels as I think it has a superior gentler washer action. I may use it for some sweaters as well that I don't want agitated. Otherwise I will be using the Panda washer for everything but heavy blankets and flannel sheets so will be seeing very little of the dreaded laundromat!<br /><br />UPDATE - my original review was rather prophetic and after 22 months of pretty heavy use I encountered leaking at bottom.  Upon draining and close inspection and some testing, it appears to be a small slit at the drain hose bend at bottom. Unlike some others may I have not kept the hose pulled up tightly to get a better water level but rather started to use the useless fill hose as an extension.  I don't see any way to make a sturdy repair without replacing the hose owing to where the split is located and being subjected to flexing, hot water, detergents, etc.  In order to get to the connection of the hose it appears I need to tear apart the machine almost completely, the tub needs to be removed from the base and that involves pulling out/off the shaft for agitator.  I decided to use some waterproof tape temporarily and have ordered a different miniwasher.<br /><br />I got my money's worth out of this I believe. I just don't think the current price and shipping is worth purchasing again.  If they replaced that awful hose with a rubber one or maybe even used a nylon or pvc elbow to make repair easier would be a great improvement.",

    "text": "UPDATE - about four months in and this unit I now find is tripping the GFCI on that outlet.  Only other appliance that does that is a fan. OK using another outlet. Customer service didn't know what to make of the GFCI tripping problem but sent a replacement.<br /><br />Overall, I have been happy with this small unit.  I was tempted to get the larger spinner to go with my Wonder Wash but as it was on back order for quite awhile and I wasn't sure this \"venture\" would work out I decided to go with this little one first and see how much trouble this was all going to be. They say its capacity is 2.2 pounds dry but what you are wetting can make quite a difference. You have to take volume into account too and just how dripping with water what you throw in there is making it a lot heavier.<br /><br />My unit arrived double boxed.  Like most things nowadays \"Made in China\" prominently marked on it but from the looks of the box I had a feeling it was going to be one of the increasingly common experiences of something in nasty shape.  I was not surprised then when I opened the outer box to find what looked/felt like fiberglass crud sprinkled over the the inner box and stryrofoam bits/dust and an assortment of grease marks, etc. on the unit.  I don't think it is refurbished,it didn't look like it had been reassembled per se.  I believe it is just the sadly typical nasty crud you see in a lot new products from China mfr facilities. Just what everybody wants in their clothes: fiberglass spicules! Cleaning up the machine and my apt from the uncrating took longer than its first spin.<br /><br />I removed the shipping protection plate on the bottom. I knew to do it from all the reviews here. It is not terribly prominent in the directions nor is it very legible on the warning label (Keep hands out when still spinning!) on the machine to remove it.  I agree they need a florescent card or similar or cling arrow pointing LOOK UNDERNEATH or something.  I had a hard time removing one screw from this packing plate - I was really worried I would damage unit as I had to wiggle plate a bit to get some loosening of the second screw which was way too tight and head getting stripped.  Speaking of labels, the caution keep hands out of spinning machine label on clear plastic lid was typically difficult to get off, some natural peanut butter removed the adhesive finally without damage.<br /><br />For my first load I wet a good sized (but not bath size - it is actually a light weight terry mat) towel and two tiny hand towels. I wanted to see if this worked before putting real clothes in it and also wanted to clean up any remaining cruft left over in there from mfr/packing. I am not sure what I did wrong and I worried again about damage from getting that packing plate off as it didn't seem overloaded or uneven, but it thumped and turned very slowly with no water at all coming out. So I took out the larger towel and carefully placed the two small ones evenly and gave it another go.  Success.  Then I put the larger towel only in there and it was fine.  I have since dried that same towel and 2 hand towels at once with no problem. I have wondered if it maybe just had to get warmed up for its first spin. I do give the clothes a little squeeze to get out some water before putting them in here to reduce the amount of spinning this has to do and hopefully extend its life.<br /><br />It is fairly quiet with a small well balanced load.  A little noisier with a larger well balanced load. Neighbors may hear or more likely feel a vibration if you are in apt as flimsy as mine. This is for extracting water from hand wash so I don't see where it will be a violation anywhere though you may get a complainer just for the noise/vibrating. I can feel it in the bedroom floor when it is spinning away in bathroom next to bedroom. Time will tell how durable it is.  I have it on a sturdy step stool next to tub with a piece of shelving to bring it up a little higher than tub edge so it can drain. The drain hose is definitely too small, two more inches would make it reasonable.  I have looked at hoses I can extend it with but don't want to spend the money right now. I have had no trouble with it walking around but I hold it when it starts up and slows down or the stool can walk a bit on the tile floor. I could solve that with a mat under the stool.  Would help with the vibration to other apts probably too.<br /><br />I am satisfied with the amount of water this extracts.  Definitely better than I could do with my arthritic hands and gentle on clothes.  I can only imagine how dry the clothes come out of its bigger brother that spins twice as fast.  I may yet get the bigger one. If this breaks down before I can get into a condo again with my own washer/dryer I might just go for the big one and then I would be able to do my sheets and towels too. This is fine if you are handwashing and can't manage wringing or if you are using a Wonder Wash to process more than just delicates. I see review here and there mentioning they spun a bath towel.  My bath towels are not oversized but I cannot even fit one in the little basket, I am not going to risk breaking this!  I think my bath towels are normal size ones and they cannot be stuffed in there dry so no way will I try.  But... My summer sheets are lightweight.  I toy with the idea of trying one at a time.  Will update if I do.  But my regular weight queen size sheets I wouldn't try. I have spun one pair of jeans by itself.  They were medium weight.  Seemed to handle it alright.<br /><br />Why am doing this? I have had my eyes the Wonder Wash awhile now as I went from a condo with my own washer and dryer to a tiny tiny apt. I understood it doesn't wring the clothes and they would take forever to dry hung in the shower. I will not vent an electric dryer indoors - I know some do and I have smelled the result and those were bigger houses. My kitchen area is the size of two telephone booths and my bathroom a single telephone booth.  The laundry facilities were initially clean here but have gone downhill to a level of filth I simply can't reach with disinfectant wipes anymore and I have seen people putting damp dirty towels and sheets and clothes into the dryer to save money bragging they are so \"clever\" saving money. No, they are filthy disgusting pigs. I will go to an attended laundramat to wash and dry my heavier things.<br /><br />Summary: I would recommend for light duty.  Would really like to get the big one but will wait until this one quits and/or I am sure it will be a long time before I get into a normal place again to do my laundry with normal machines.",

    "text": "My unit looked pretty much as pictured except I have what resembles duct tape around the center of mine to cover the surprisingly sloppy glue job of putting the two halves together.  The sloppiness of the adhesive is very apparent on the inside but so far no leaks and the brown glue hasn't come off on my clothes that I have noticed. UPDATE: after seeing a recent reviewer remark about the seam problem and leakage I took more notice of mine and sure enough, the tape was coming away and it was because of seepage - I emailed customer service on Saturday, they responded on Monday morning right away they were sending a replacement and I had it Wednesday. You really can't ask for better service.  So, they had a bad batch and that can certainly happen with all the offshore mfrg these days.  Mine did come with some instructions and there is a little diagram at the bottom of the sheet and it is not really hard to put together if you even look at the picture here. It did not come with an extra handle as some have said but then again if you break the handle you are doing it wrong. This is not hard to crank if you hit the \"sweet spot\" of load's water/clothes ratio. I didn't think the stand was as flimsy as people are saying.  A lightweight tubular metal might be a nicer touch but this is serviceable. One of the warnings they give I cannot understand: \"Do not release the pressure lid of machine if machine is still hot as vacuum can form when machine cools down\" - huh?  If you opened the lid you can't have a vacuum. Don't understand - I think they mean to drain with the tube rather than open lid if machine is hot. I think.<br /><br />The washing instructions are maybe easier if you have a scale to weigh your load, if they gave some average examples it would be better.  They don't mention whether chlorine bleach is safe (I was thinking of the glue) or how much of it to use and the amount of detergent though they list, I am sure can vary by concentration so it is a learning curve.  I did use chlorine bleach on two loads of whites and the glue has not disintegrated but I will try to limit my use of it in case - I am using about a tablespoon for a full load of 6 quarts.  I am going to email mfr and ask - will update here.  One word of warning - if you use bleach do not have face near opening when you you unscrew lid!  Whew, close call there lung full of hot bleach fumes - not nice.  UPDATE - I did email customer service during normal business hours and they responded within the hour that it is safe to use chlorine bleach.  I can tell you I have used 1 tablespoon to a full load (6 qts). The directions on the bleach bottle for 1 gallon of water is a quarter cup.  YMMV - I may up what I am using a bit but be careful when you open, it can be really fumey!<br /><br />I did better on my second load. By my third load I was a pro. On my fourth and fifth loads I got complacent and didn't tighten the lid down properly and OOPS flood.  My fault entirely but my sixth load was the two bath mats I used to soak up the deluges :) from 4th and 5th loads. It handled the two bathmat/towels fine.<br /><br />My logistics: no room in the kitchen so I am using the bathroom.  It doesn't fit in my tub very well - I believe this is a nonstandard (like everything here) small tub.  So for my second load I dragged and manhandled a sturdy occasional table through the nonstandard small doorway to hold this (and the spinner after)next to tub but there was only about an inch of clearance around table and I could barely reach the tub faucets.  So I picked up a sturdy fairly large step stool that is just a little lower than tub edge, but drain tube is high enough to clear. I fill it up with measured hot water with a pitcher.  For rinses, I do two - sort of- with cold water and I use my shower massage, first swishing them up a bit with the shower going in there with drain tube attached and let it run out a bit. Then pull tube and I close it up with a good amount of water and give it a couple of spins. And you definitely want a spinner/extractor if you are going to do real laundry, of course.<br /><br />Now why you would want to put yourself through this if you are not a camper/nature enthusiast/environmentalist? I have had my eyes on this and similar items for awhile now as I went from a condo with my own washer and dryer to an efficiency (nothing efficient about this place) apt that not only does not allow a real portable but there is no where to put it.  My kitchen area is the size of two telephone booths and my bathroom a single telephone booth.  The laundry facilities were initially clean here but have gone downhill to a level of filth I simply can't reach with disinfectant wipes (you don't want to know what I discovered in the non user-removable lint strainer of the washers) and have seen people putting damp dirty towels and sheets and clothes into the dryer to save money bragging they are so \"clever\". No, they are filthy disgusting pigs. This isn't the venue I guess to talk about the laundrymat miseries. Pardon tangent.<br /><br />Summary: I would recommend, I take off one star for the really sloppy glue job inside, you don't see it but your clothes are certainly rubbing against the brown adhesive and you have to wonder when something is going to come off on your good white blouse.",

    "text": "I have my Senseo almost a year (just found out is being recalled - please check yours! [...] ).  Anyway before finding out about the recall I started having trouble finding the only coffee pod I like, Sumatra.  It was no longer in any grocery or other retail store in area and even Walmart shiptostore no longer carried.  Tried every other non-flavored pod I could get my hands on locally and none were acceptable. There are still places on the web but didn't want to spend even more for what is expensive coffee already. Figured I would try this and would use espresso fine grind as recommended since I like a strong cup. Well, I tried both regular espresso grind and a very fine grind.  Both expensive enough that it wouldn't be much cheaper than the packaged pods even. Tried one cup (with an empty just water run first to get everything hot), one-cup twice for a mug full, and two cup setting.  The coffee varied from mediocre to impossible to drink.  For the most part, I get brown water with a foaminess (not foam on top, more a \"general\" foaminess) You can tell when it is coming out, after first blast, it is hardly colored anymore. And no coffee aroma. The best results are packing as tightly as possible with the finest grind and using one cup setting (running without pod first to heat everything up and having fresh water in it rather than what was sitting in boiler since yesterday).<br /><br />That result, however drinkable, is not worth the mess.  And what a mess.  I knew the pods would be a little messy to fill and figured it would be the price to pay for this being cheaper than buying pods on the web.  But the mess to empty! Yikes.  Now I remember why I got the Senseo in the first place.  To not go through the mess of grinds to deal with.  And very fine espresso grinds packed tightly into the pods are very messy indeed to clean out. More like dirt.  I don't have a garbage disposal so this is awful.  Not only do I have the dry grounds mess filling, I have the wet mess disposal to deal with.<br /><br />For now I have bought the Sumatra on the web.  And will use that until the replacement machine comes.  Since that machine is black (that is all they are giving in exchange for recalled machines) and mine is red (the other reason I bought it!).  I think I will sell the black one unused and get myself a Keurig.  Senseo is too much trouble and whether the Sumatra pods have become difficult to find because they are maybe closing up?  Or if it is just being phased out, I can't find a coffee I like in their line anymore so why go on with this.<br /><br />If you are into very watered down coffee, the ecopads are an option for you. To me it is too much mess for nothing.",

The fan motor mount was clearly shorter on one side. Appears to be manufacturing defect vs shipping. No external damage noted when unpacking and this is in the heart of the beast.. Had it not been for this I might have rated it 5 star...  Having to purchase additional filters and bulbs just to make it work was a little unreasonable given the premium price of the unit.

    "text": "Review Update March 2021<br /><br />I love this washer. We use it almost daily in our RV and it hasn't let me down yet. As long as we have sunny weather for drying, I don't need to use a laundromat at all on the road. We're in the RV full time for 18 months on a volunteer project and this washing machine has saved my sanity. Definitely worth the price.<br /><br />Review Update to 5 stars - Sept 2020<br /><br />After using this washer several times in our travel trailer on a trip, I'm seriously impressed. I did 3 loads today after one of the dogs got sick on her bedding. We hosed the bed cover off outside and tossed it and another cover plus 2 regular bath towels in the washer. Set the machine to heavy duty with hot water and 45 minutes later everyone was clean. No odors or stains at all. The spin cycle left even the towels 90% dry - we hung everything on our dog fence outside to air dry and the covers were ready to use in a half hour.<br /><br /> This is super quiet and while there is a bit of vibration on spin, its barely noticeable in the trailer. I did 3 loads total today consisting of 2 dog bed covers, 4 towels, 4 tshirts, a dishtowel, one pair of jeans and 3 days of underwear and socks. We're using liquid Arm & Hammer detergent and Snuggle fabric softener just like at home in the washer.<br /><br />*********** Original Review Below 4 Star now a 5 star **************<br /><br />I was so disappointed when we bought a used travel trailer and I realized there was no room and no connections for any sort of washer and dryer or even a combo unit inside. Turns out, I can use this washer in the trailer and not sacrifice much. It's tall and narrow rather than short and squat and that means it can fit in a tighter spot than other appliances. For us, it's essentially in a cubby space adjacent to the RV kitchen sink and takes up about 2 feet by 2 feet of floor space.  A worthy trade off to have clean underwear on the go.<br /><br />My unit has a series of small dents on the exterior,  but nothing severe or massive. Cosmetic damage only, it still works. It says \"11 pounds\" load size, but in the real world, it translates to 3 tshirts, 3 pairs of socks and a couple pairs of underwear. Its not meant for real laundry,  just small stuff. I've used it once with lightly soiled shirts and it did get them clean. You also want to use less detergent than in a regular washer. We'll definitely be replacing the connection hoses with sturdier ones pretty soon. For our needs in a small travel trailer, I'm happy with this machine.",

    "text": "This is one of those things that works fine as long as you don't expect too much and just use it for the basics. I wanted it for two reasons - occasional power outages and to take out to the cabin in West Texas. We can use this with our generator in the event of a hurricane or rare ice storm that leaves us with no power for several days again.<br /><br />The two burners aren't meant to be used with full size cookware at the same time though - the burners are too close together and the entire cooktop is too small for that. It isn't a replacement for an actual stove, just a supplement of sorts.  Cooking a couple of eggs in a small skillet or a single can of soup in a small sauce pan is fine.<br /><br />My unit gets hot fast and worked just fine the two times that I've used it so far. We've done soup and grilled cheese sandwiches on this which is pretty much what we will use it for out at the cabin as well with the generator.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:5a3f6b4ad2e4e41e8ae786900d579a60]] We use portable ice machines all the time and have for a decade. Our tiny refrigerator/freezer has no room to put ice cube trays. We used to buy ice, but long ago went with portable ice machines. They meet our need perfectly.<br /><br />The manufacturers all seem to be making them cheaper and cheaper. Our first ice machine lasted over 4 years. Every subsequent machine has given out at only one year (or less). Our last one decided to die last month. We got about a year and a half from that one (after the company replaced the first one, which was a lemon). So, I found myself shopping for ice machines again.<br /><br />This machine has a very high rating and lots of reviews. The average review is pretty posotive with high stars given. I read the comments about wet ice, but thought maybe these folks had not previously used portable ice machines before (they do not make super hard cubes).<br />Nope, they were right.<br /><br />We let this machine sit for 2 days after opening (a little longer than the mfg suggests) to make sure all oil levels were properly settled. We added water to the fill line and waited for the magic. It makes cubes well. We dumped out the first entire batch of cubes from the initial water batch and had run the self-cleaning option. The cubes looked ok.<br /><br />So now we were ready to make ice to actually use. We only use bottled water, as we have hard water here.<br /><br />Now, the machine itself is very nice looking.<br />It is more vertical than our previous machines. The overall footprint is smaller, BUT it is taller as well. That is something to consider if you plan on putting it under a counter or shelf. Be sure to leave plenty of air circulation around it as well. We chose the red one. The color is great.<br /><br />It takes a bit longer to make a batch of ice than other machines we have had. But after using it for a week, I can tell you EXACTLY why the ice cubes are wet with this model.<br /><br />While the rest of the machine seems decent, the LID is made of the thinnest, cheapest plastic I've ever seen on one of these machines. Have you ever bought disposable plastic stemware for the holidays? Those are thicker. You can hold your hand near any part of the lid, and you can feel the cold air flowing OUT. No insulation in the lid whatsoever. Most models have a sturdy lid with a smaller window where you can see if the ice is ready. It helps keep the cold INSIDE the machine as much as possible. Not this machine!<br /><br />Portable ice machines don't keep ice frozen forever, of course, but they at least keep it a few hours. Not this model. It starts melting as soon as it hits the basket. And why not? This poorly-constructed lid is the equivalent of putting a piece of saran wrap over the ice!! Wait - nope, saran wrap would keep the cold in better too.<br />And because it is so thin, you'll need to be careful about just letting the lid drop down after you get ice out. It is pretty fragile. But what a horrible design/material choice for an otherwise-nice machine. If these were inexpensive appliances, I might not mind so much. But they are not cheap, and I no longer have a lot of \"play\" in my budget for these types of purchases.<br /><br />The ice comes out frozen as hard as any of our machines have done. BUT, the thin lid lets cold air out and room temp air IN. The ice immediately starts to melt, making for very wet cubes that then stick together in a clump. And I'm not talking about the standard slightly-damp cubes of any portable ice maker - I am talking full out wet, due to the lid offering ZERO temperature protection or insulation. VERY disappointing.<br /><br />So this machine is a hard pass from me. (I have tried to start the return process, which I have 2 months to do, but it isn't letting me complete it for whatever reason.)<br /><br />Anyway, this is our 5th portable ice machine in 10 years. I hope it lasts quite a while, but not holding my breath. I really, truly recommend going with a different machine. This one is just poorly designed.",

    "text": "UPDATE as of July 2020 -<br /><br />We ended up having to move last year, so only used this ice maker for about two months before packing it back up in its original packaging for a local move. It didn't get UNpacked until three months ago. We plugged it back in, ran a few rounds of lemon water through it to clean out the tubes, and got it going. Things seemed fine. It wasn't even as noisy as it was before. We only use bottled water in it, as our area has pretty hard water. But then last week, it suddenly decided it wasn't going to make ice any more. It was giving us the \"add water\" error message, even though it was full. We tried turning it off and back on several times. We also completely unplugged it, hoping that might reset whatever had gone wrong.<br />Nope.<br />Dead ice maker.<br /><br />So, we got LESS THAN SIX MONTHS' use from this ice maker. I don't know if it was just a lemon (you can read my original review...it never sounded right, and I never got a response from Frigidaire), or if this company makes extra-cheap machines. I am beyond disappointed in this. I need an ice maker and now can't afford to replace this one, with so little use on it.<br />Not happy.<br />------------<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW -<br />We've had two other ice machines over the last decade. We keep this upstairs. I am partially disabled and don't have the mobility to run to the kitchen fridge. These machines help me have cold drinks and fill ice bags.<br /><br />I love the color on this one. We've not had the Frigidare brand before, but most of these portable ice makers are the same and just have a different label slapped on them. It is pictured in the photo (decal was ours, they do not come thay way).<br /><br />This is making ice ok for now, but I am SERIOUSLY concerned about how long it will last!  We have NEVER had one that sounded like it was on its last leg, gasping and grunting to get the water up into the freezing compartment!  It grunts and grinds so loudly, it makes the overflow tray on our keurig coffee maker (maybe 1-1/2 to 2 feet from the ice maker) shake!  It is like a mini earthquake when it pumps water up!  I KNOW this is not normal. At first, we thought the coffee pot was dying and grunting, as we listened from the other room. Nope...it was this ice maker.<br /><br />I would like to see either the seller or manufacturer step up and replace this machine for us. We bought it new, not a refurb. Very disappointed in this unit so far. But I can no longer afford to just get a different one. 😓",

    "text": "Wow. Just wow.<br />This machine arrived today. We set it up, and let it sit for four hours to let the fluids settle. The directions say two hours, but we got busy and it was four hours later.<br /><br />I rinsed off the machine's insides with a soft cloth before first use. Then I filled it with water and a little lemon juice. The reservoir holds a lot more water than our old machine...<br />I plugged it in and turned on the power. The power light goes green and I can select small or large cubes (the booklet says you can choose from three sizes, but there's only two).<br /><br />That's the end of the success.<br />The &#34;ice full&#34; light came on immediately without it ever pulling up any water. The area with the ice prongs ACTS like it is going to bring in water (and it did bring in a little bit, not a full load the first time and immediately dumped it back into the reservoir), but then it doesn't really do a thing, goes through the dumping motion and the &#34;ice full&#34; light flips on.<br /><br />So, dug out the little book that came with it. Troubleshooting says it is one of two things:  either the water sensors are dirty and you should clean them, or you should use cold water or add ice to the reservoir if the room temps are above 80º (? Or 85º).  So, in other words, the machine that was in our home for less than five hours already needs cleaned, OR I need to only use it during cool weather???<br /><br />This is ridiculous and this hunk of trash is going back.<br />I cannot believe no one tests any of these things before sending them to customers. The one I bought says &#34;Igloo&#34; in the description and &#34;RCA&#34; on the front and in the photo. Quite frankly, RCA products are bad, but I thought in this case, it was just the label, as it seems at least six different sellers have the exact same machines.<br /><br />Avoid.<br />Save up and get a better one.

    "text": "I looked at probably 20 portable ice makers before choosing this one.<br />Price was a factor, but so was customer input from reviews. It seemed like many of the other models were the exact same machine with a different company label stuck on them, and their reviews were so varied, it seemed like you either got a lemon or a good one.<br /><br />Also, all the others opened at the top and vented on the side. For some reason, I thought this one would work better in our area, with the drawer pulling out at the front, and I THOUGHT the vent would be at the side like all the other machines.<br /><br />My purpose in buying this is not for a bar or camper, like many people. I am partially disabled, and can't get downstairs to the kitchen on any sort of regular basis. I really wanted to be able to have ice when I wanted some, especially with the heat of summer rolling in very, very soon. I don't like room temperature drinks, esp water or tea, so I'd found myself drinking Pepsi almost exclusively, the only thing I could stand at room temp. That needed to stop!<br /><br />So, I ended up buying this one, but the experience was not a pleasant one. I love my Amazon prime dearly, but they really botched this one. The shipping dates got moved around even after I paid extra for one-day shipping, and ended up with this being delivered on a totally different day, when I was the only one home and could not come to the door. (Note that Amazon did end up giving me a small credit on my acct to try to make up for the shipping problem, even though it did not solve my problem.) I always chat with the UPS guys through the upstairs window, so they left it for me anyway. I knew my son would be home very shortly after, and he was. He brought the box up, and I have to say that I am almost positive I got a customer return. The box looked like it had previous shipping labels peeled off of it. The box was beat up, torn, and had a crushed in spot on the side. Our UPS guys are really great, so I think it was shipped out from Day One looking like that - who in the warehouses think customers really want something that looks that bad?! (And yes, I know this is a product review section, and I can file shipping problems elsewhere, and I will. Just giving folks a heads-up of how it is shipped and what I received.) This is shipped in its original mfg box with tie cords on it, there is no other packaging other than what the mfg sends it out with - no Amazon packaging whatsoever. Strike One.<br /><br />I opened the box, not sure of what I would find. It only has two big strips of styrofoam on the sides to hold it.<br />Ours indeed had a dent in the side, and one of the back exhaust fans had cracked plastic. Not a crisis, but at this price, I really do expect a brand new item in great condition! Strike Two.<br /><br />SMELLS/TASTE: I read a lot of reviews that talk about the plastic smell and/or taste in the cubes, and how it didn't seem to want to fire up well. IF someone reads the directions (not everyone likes to do that!), you'd see it says to make sure the machine sits for at least an hour to allow the coolant to properly settle back into place after you unpack it. This particular model also says to run a bleach solution through it to help clean it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT!! The machine indeed smells heavily of plastic. Anyone who has had a relay switch burn out on an item knows what smell I am talking about - sort of like melting plastic. Ugh. However, having read plenty about portable ice makers before buying one, I knew that either vinegar or lemon juice would also work just fine. I chose to go with one that was ingestible, rather than bleach!! We did the lemon juice, and ran an entire cycle of cubes through it with the lemon/water. (Toss the ice please!) I then ran two loads (all the cubes a full water tank would make) through it of plain water. AFTER those cycles, I wiped it out again and ran regular water through it to try making cubes we'd use. We had no problems at all with any funny tastes in our ice this way. If you have a bad quality of tap water though, I'd suggest using either bottled, filtered or distilled water. It is only natural that your cubes will not taste better than your tap water. Ours is okay, so we're good that way. I would have bought a water filter (like a Brita) if that had not been the case. No lemony taste, no plastic taste, no gross tastes or odors at all. (Remember, I really do NOT recommend using bleach like the mfg suggests. While I understand the germ-killing properties of the bleach, I really don't want to ingest any of it. I would also think it would be much more caustic to the plastic parts and hoses of the machine, wearing them out sooner. Stick with lemon juice.) It did smell like plastic out the exhaust fan for quite a while, but it is fading away.<br /><br />NOISE: Of course it is going to make noise. This has a compressor, and it will be making some noise. However, I've found that at its noisiest part of the cycle, it is no different than a microwave oven running, sometimes a little quieter.The ice cubes dumping make me jump a little bit, at least at first, but then again I am easily startled. Made the cats jump too! LOL! However, they are pretty much used to it now, even if they eyeball it suspiciously while it is running.<br /><br />I have to say that I haven't stopped to time an actual cycle to make the ice. I've tried the small, medium and large cubes though. They are all gumdrop-shaped (or like the Dots candy at the movies), with a hole in the middle of the bottom. It didn't seem to take very long though. The small ones were a little too small for my uses, but would be good for smaller drink glasses. I use a [[ASIN:B003X46LHG Bubba Brands Keg 52 Oz Mug Slate Gray]] to hold the ice at the moment, and love it. If you use the medium size, you can get the first batch in around 10 minutes, but the other batches do seem to take longer for some reason. It has also seemed to get \"stuck\" where it runs and runs, with nothing going on. I turn it off, let it sit a minute and push start again, and off it goes. I am not sure if it is just my machine with the dents from rough handling, or if all of this model is like that.<br /><br />I was disappointed that this unit does not exhaust on the side, reason being where I planned to locate it, on a table behind my bed! It would vent towards my pillow, which is just not gonna happen. So, I have it turned sideways so it will vent towards the doorway. It makes opening the ice drawer more awkward, and makes me wish I'd tried one of the top-opening models now. There wasn't anything in the photos and such to suggest that this unit would be different than most of the other portable ice makers. It is. I'll post photos at a later date.<br /><br />This model's book also suggests plugging the machine in to a GFI outlet, or grounded plug that will shut off if it senses dampness. I don't have one in the bedroom, and currently am using a heavy-duty, three-prong extension cord and plugging it in in the bathroom, where we do have a GFI plug. Not ideal, but better than trying to get a special outlet installed in a rented bedroom.<br /><br />The scoop is VERY tiny. It works best to scoop towards you, so you don't send ice cubes back into the machine.<br />The measuring cup works well for pouring, because you have a small reservoir to fill, and you have to go over a small clear rubber \"wall\" that helps to hold the drawer in place and hold temperatures.<br /><br />Any unused ice does indeed melt back into the reservoir and is recycled back into cubes. Once I have enough ice for anyone who wants it, I turn it off rather than let it continually cycle. I also unplug it in the evenings when I go to bed for the night, since I'm the only one who can't go downstairs for ice if they want it. I hope that saves on the \"vampire electricity\" of the unit. Note that this is not a refrigerated ice maker, and the unused ice WILL melt. Many people complained about ice cubes stuck together - I've only experienced that when getting ice that has been done for an hour or so (it keeps the ice for at least an hour after the last cycle at this point) - otherwise, the cubes are all loose and easy to use. If you try to take the ice drawer all the way out after leaving the ice sit for a while, it WILL leak water on you - the water is simply the ice melting back and going through the drain holes that let it run back into the reservoir. (Nope - I didn't even think about the drainage holes when I pulled the drawer out the first time, and had water on the table and the floor. That was my fault though.)<br /><br />For now, I am mostly happy with it. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have ice when I want it, instead of waiting for someone to get home in the evening and get me some! It was an expensive luxury though, and one I really thought long and hard about getting since I can no longer work. I'm thinking I really want to keep it. The cosmetic issues were VERY annoying, since I paid for a new machine, not a used one, but in this case, I blame Amazon for sending this out with a crushed box from the get-go. I would not have accepted it, had I been able to get to the door and saw it. Again - for some reason, this was the most problematic purchase I've ever had in all my time on Amazon.<br /><br />This machine has not reached Strike Three yet, but you can be sure I'll come back and update my review should that happen. For now, I'll keep running it, and see how it seems to work, dents, cracked exhaust grid and all. (The dents are even more annoying, because it has a stainless steel appearance. It shows readily. It was more of a hassle to return it than to just keep it, as long as it continues to work.)<br /><br />UPDATE June 29, 2012:<br />Well, I've had this machine for a little over a month now. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it make ice?<br />Yep. Does it make a little noise?  Yep, but not unbearable.<br />So far, the broken parts do not seem to be affecting the basic function of the machine.<br />While I still have not literally timed the cube cycle (I have good intentions, but seems like there's always<br />something better to do than watch the clock for ice cubes to drop! Ha!), I have found the medium cubes to be the most useful. In fact, I often use an empty Sobe Lifewater bottle to make quick tea (loving the new tea from Lipton with the honey in it), and the medium cubes fit in this bottle perfectly. So, that might give folks a better idea about the size of the medium cube. The difference in the sizes are basically more (or less) layers of ice on the cubes. The small ones are still too big for a basic 16.9 oz water bottle, and melt too fast when I shake up my tea.<br />The first batch of the day takes around 10 minutes, but for some reason, they are skinnier than the normal mediums. The machine makes additional batches inbetween 10-15 minutes. Around 2 or 2-1/2 of the water cup it comes with to fill the reservoir to maximum. That will fill the ice bin to the top with medium cubes.<br /><br />At this point, I increased my stars by one, because of the function of the machine, and it being willing to<br />do what I \"hired\" it to do - keep me in cold drinks. Strike three has not yet happened, and I hope it doesn't!<br />Enjoy!",

It isn't in a hot garage - it is in the<br />upstairs bedroom. It still can't handle warm temps!<br /><br />It has been very warm here this week. While we run the A/C endlessly, this little fridge<br />can't give us a cold drink. All we get are bottles that have a slight, well how should I say this,<br />a clammy feel to them. You can tell they were in a colder environment than the room, but<br />the drinks themselves (bottled water, 24 oz pepsi's and juice boxes) are NOT cold.<br /><br />This has been a major disappointment. I had already thrown the packing material away as it had been<br />doing a pretty good job and I trusted the brand name. Who knew that it was so dependent on the temperature<br />in the room as to whether or not you would get a cold drink??<br /><br />Seriously disappointing, and it will be my LAST Igloo purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE 08/04/11:<br />Well, we've now had this three months.  So far, we've had lots of drinks that were barely colder<br />than room temperature. The freezer door (which was NOT the interior that was pictured with the listing<br />when we bought it - they had the interiors mixed up with a Haier) had so much frost build-up that the door<br />broke completely off a couple weeks ago. No, we didn't use the freezer - it didn't do anything but freeze that little<br />mini tray of ice cubes. The freezer pops (those tubes that look like they are filled with koolaid) don't even<br />freeze in there. I thought hey, maybe with that little freezer section open, the drinks will get colder. Nope!<br /><br />We have it cranked all the way to 7, the highest this will go. The drinks are not cold by any means.<br />It does a nice job of keeping things like cheese or fruit, and not too bad on yogurt. However, I wanted<br />to have COLD drinks this summer, and I am not getting them. We have bottled water and Pepsi in the fridge.<br />Nothing in a plastic bottle gets very cold at all. We also have some cans of ginger ale in the can rack.<br />Because of the aluminum, they are a little bit colder than the bottles, but not a lot.<br /><br />I was putting some more water in there this afternoon, and the inside was so warm and clammy that I checked to<br />see if it stopped working already. I checked the plugs to be sure it was still plugged in, and it was.<br />I turned it off for a few minutes to let it rest, then turned it back on. I did not hear a thing. So, I'll check<br />it tomorrow to see if it died completely. I don't think it did - I just think it cools very poorly and inefficiently.<br /><br />I COMPLETELY regret this purchase. Steer clear of the Igloo models.<br />The other brands are a little more (some places, just $30-$50 more), but you might get something that<br />actually cools your drinks down. This model can't seem to do it. Big disappointment. This is the most<br />expensive thing I've bought online in a long time, and the joke was on me.<br /><br />Shame on Igloo for making something so shabby. It looks great on the outside, but can't do the job<br />you hire it to do. I didn't need another thing taking up floor space - I needed a bedroom refrigerator.",

I find that a really good fine grind works best - I use a coffee measure and get a perfect, groundless mug each time- I like a good strong cup with good aroma.  My-Kap service was great - prompt, efficient and no over-packaging.  I have wasted money buying the Keurig re-usable filter, does not make good coffee because of water flow, does not fit in K-cup carousel tower. I also tried Solofill, it gave off lots of residue in bottom of mug, coffee had a bitter taste -- I am so happy I tried one more time and this time My-Kap was a WINNER all the way around, especially nice not to go through removing the K-cup housing each time. I also re-use the K-cup filter, I just rinse it well after each use and let it dry - no need to order filters or make your own, the old intact filter works great and I can store several in my carousel. Better coffee, saves money, great buy.",

    "text": "I have been drinking \"cold brew\" for well over a decade now. The occasional coffee house would have a cold brew system, and so it was a treat back then to purchase a cup of extra strong and extra smooth coffee. Then I started making it at home. There were no special brew systems yet available. So I would simply take a big pitcher dump a bunch of ground coffee into it, then top it off with water. Cover, let sit for a full day, then either carefully pour into a cup as desired (while trying to keep grounds from falling out), or when I was feeling more motivated I would strain through a cheesecloth. Either way, I had easy cold brewed coffee. YUM.<br /><br />Forward to the past several years where cold brew coffee has hit critical mass. Most everyone has heard of it, most coffee shops offer it, and many stores sell it. Many cold brew systems are available, just in different styles. Some coffee pot systems are trying to state that they offer cold brew option- but be aware-- cold brew is NOT ICED COFFEE. It is only cold/room temp water on ground coffee, there is no heat applied at any point (save for if you decide to heat it up after the fact). Ok, so.. this brewer:<br /><br />I have tried a few different types of cold brew systems since my days of dumping loose ground coffee in a pitcher. These days things are a little more stream lined and a tad easier. None of them do anything extra special, it is really just about your preference. It basically breaks down to needing a filter of some sort (can be resuable metal cylinder or paper, like this one has), a vessel to \"brew\" in. That's it. This system happens to have a little extra in its design. I thought it might be a little much, but I found it pleasant to use, and there was no mess.<br /><br />There appears to be many parts, but it is super easy to figure out. Instructions are super easy to understand if need be.<br /><br />Steps:<br /><br />--The brew container* (see additional info on this part below) is what what you will use to \"brew\" your coffee. The ratio is 1:8? 8 ounces (1/2 lb) of coffee to about 64 ounces of cold or room temp water. This does not need to be exact. You will not mess up a batch of cold brew if you use a little too much or a little less (though more would be better since you can water it down later if need be). You put course ground coffee into the included paper filter. If not already in base, then place coffee filled bag in side. Put cover on, and set aside on counter or in fridge for 12-24 hours. I usually wait a full day. Sometimes I go longer depending on when I started it. In this case, it was late afternoon, and I kept it on counter for a full day and a half so I could drink some in the morning.<br /><br />*1. the brew vessel has a lever and stopper you will need to attach. Super quick and easy. Make sure the level is in the stop/closed position before adding water.<br />*2. Also, there is a 2 pack of carafe filters (small round sponges) that are optional use. I find they are easy to rinse and reuse.<br /><br />--Once you are done \"brewing\", put the brewing vessel on top of the grooved pitcher. This is where the lever on the brewing vessel comes in. Push it open. This immediately drains your cold brew into a pourable pitcher. Once the brew vessel is empty, take out bag full of spent coffee and toss it out (OR if you are super thrifty and careful.. perhaps rinse and reuse?). Your pitcher is now full of delicious, smooth, concentrated coffee. The pitcher comes with a lid. The pitcher is of a workable size- easy to hold, small enough to store in fridge, yet holds nearly 2 liters. The size is perfect for storing in the fridge. Indents in the pitcher make it easy to grab/hold.<br /><br />EDIT: Unlike other brew systems, it dawned on me that I could get another batch \"brewing\" at any time after the first one. This is because the brew container is separate from the storage container. My other \"brewer\" is a brewer and pitcher in one. So not until I finish the container (or find a different container to store concentrate in) can I make another batch.  With this system, I can simply start another even if storage pitcher is in use (so long as I can access it it after brewing, which I tend to brew for 24-36 hours). Anyway, thought I would come back to add that in since it wasn't an immediate thought when I was using this initially.<br /><br />\"Cold brew\" is considered a coffee concentrate. The idea is to have a strong coffee that can withstand being watered down by ice and other coffee additions (cream, syrups, etc) without losing the coffee taste. Or you can drink it straight if you like very strong coffee (I do!). In addition to that, it makes a very smooth coffee. Usually reduces/removes acidity.  And lastly, although it seems like it is only consumed cold, it technically can be warmed up to be enjoyed hot. Some people cold brew to reduce the acidity, and then want to still have warm/hot coffee. Go for it.  For me, I just really like the added oomph of taste that cold brew coffee makes. I have even noticed that it can make kinda blah coffee even better by being cold brewed. (have you ever purchased a container of coffee and not really liked it? Try cold brewing it-- it just might change things enough to make it palatable!).<br /><br />Specially about this system: In short, I like it. I first thought it was going to be too many parts to deal with, but I see that the parts it comes with that once they are on, no need to take them off (save for if your brewer needs extra TLC when cleaning). The brew vessel AND a pitcher is more than what is really needed (often I see that a vessel could be the pitcher just by taking bag/filter out)- but this makes it super clean and easy to deal with. I DO like the paper filter over a metal filter in terms of speed of clean up, but some people would prefer not to have excess waste.<br /><br />This style of system is really going to come down to preference. All the parts on mine look good, work soundly, and I have no problem with using this. With one caveat, the pitcher fits into the brew vessel for easy, compact storage (put lid on pitcher, but find spot for vessel lid). This system comes with TWO  PLA bag filters, so you will need more. I do not know what this system costs but it doesn't need to be expensive to be effective. I see that the 25 pack of the filters is $15 (or less if buying 25 pack of regular filters). I have a glass with metal filter system that works well for around $25 although makes half as much at a time). Or just use my old school method of a pitcher with loose coffee in it. :)<br /><br />If you choose this, know that it absolutely makes a great pitcher of cold brew coffee concentrate. No problems there.<br /><br />Because I do not know what the price is, I can't automatically recommend this- but I would nudge people in the direction of this style. I personally think it is even easier than the metal filter style, and this makes a decent amount- not too much, but not too little. If it is within reason of other brewers, I would be real pleased. While I normally don't take into consideration price, I do if there are enough of similar products on market-- and knowing that cold brew systems are pretty much all the same except for filter material- that I can comfortably comment on it. Therefor I would normally ask, why would I recommend this over other brewers? That is when price might come into play, along with some other design features. Since this also requires use of paper filter, that is an additional cost. This just comes with two filters, so you would pretty much need to add in the additional cost right away. Say, if I was ordering this I would also order a pack of filters at same time.<br /><br />What would improve upon product:  While the pitcher and lid fits into the brewing vessel for more compact storage, the lid of the brewing vessel has nowhere to go. It could be placed on bottom so all of it just sits on it, or it can be placed on top but there again, it is just resting on it. It doesn't make for perfectly tidy storage. It would work if the brew vessel was taller or the pitcher was shorter-- then the pitcher would nestle down into the brew vessel and the lid could just go on top. The difference doesn't seem like it would be enough to displace water/coffee ratio, but would certainly add to the tidiness of storing it.<br /><br />Current rating: 5 stars.  It totally works as intended, and I have used enough cold brewers of various styles to be extra pleased with this one. I really didn't think it would be better than my simple glass  pitcher with metal filter, but the paper filter and ease of separating the brewed coffee into a separate pitcher has impressed me. This system may be my new go-to brewer and I will pass my other one on to a friend. This is a matter of preference for me. Ultimately the rating goes toward the fact that it works well and produces a solid \"cold brew\" end result. I have been drinking a cup (ok, maybe 3) while writing this so excuse my length. I feel like writing a dissertation on cold brew while simultaneously running full speed on my treadmill. WEEEEEEEEEEe cold brew is fun! :)",

I love how quiet it is and you can put it on the night mode where you can't even see the adjustment light. It's programmable up to 12 hours and it has four mist levels. It Is hip for dry lips, and it is good for your sinus. I recommend my friend. Thank you for looking at my review.

What I mean is each row, or technically we should say column, can hold 6 eggs. These columns are separated by a very subtle raise or hump. Well, I feel this hump could be a little higher. As is, sometimes an egg from another column can roll over.<br />* Lastly, depending on how level your fridge or shelves are, you may find that on one shelf, the eggs won't roll, but on another it will. For our fridge, we found that the upper two levels won't roll, but when we put the trays on our bottom level, the eggs rolled nicely.<br /><br />Overall, we'll go 4-Stars!",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:38607a72aabbe686d932e103c44a1d93]] THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Quality components from the can housing to the cylinder, valve and fittings.<br />* Can smash taller 16 oz cans as well.<br />* Easy to assemble, even without instructions. All you do is look at the product photos and you'll get your answer of what goes where.<br />* Fun, fun, fun!<br />* Watch my video for some tips.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* No manual was in the box. So I asked the seller for it, and they sent me pictures quickly. But it was pointless. Because the \"manual\" was basically assembly images. I can figure out the assembly, just by looking at their final product photos. What I was looking for was tips, advice, explanations of why this fitting goes here, goes there, etc. Yet still, for a manual that was all about assembly, they leave out the most important part. How do you connect their fittings to an air compressor? Because their fitting is pretty unusual, at least to a newbie. In any case, I uploaded their manual photos for your convenience.<br />* I still don't know how they want us to connect their can crusher to an air compressor. They obviously have a method in mind, but they don't explain it. They included an extra elbow fitting, and something called an \"air pump junction.\" It's the letter G item in the packet list photo in their listing page. Watch my video to understand my confusion.<br />* So I had to look at other can crushers on the market to understand how to connect this to an air compressor. What I found out was other sellers include a 1/4\" NPT Quick Connect High Flow fitting. So that's what I got, and that's how I got this can crusher going. That's not good when your customers have to go to other sellers to see how things work. LOL!<br />* The valve included in this package does not automatically reset the cylinder disc. I've seen other can crushers where you push the button, it crushes the can. You let go, and the cylinder resets itself ready for the next crush. With this version, you press the button, it smashes the can, but the cylinder disc does not retract when you let go the button. You have to \"Reset\" by turning the button/knob clockwise. Then the disc retracts. Not a deal breaker, but just something worth mentioning.<br />* They are very stingy with the airline tubes. When you connect the airline tubes, you feel a CLICK. For the longer tube, I could not feel a click on both ends. I can feel a click on the end I start, but it wasn't long enough for me to get a good connection on the other end. So I ended up getting a lot of hissing, which means air leaking. So if you need more airline tube, then the  search phrase you need to use is, \"8mm pneumatic tubing.\" 8mm is what you want. The long tube that was in the package was 10.25\", so I just cut myself something around 11\". The shorter one was about 5\", so I cut myself something around 6\". If you're going to get into pneumatic tools, then these extra tubes you have to buy won't be a waste of money. They'll come in handy in the future.<br /><br />In conclusion... If you are new to pneumatic can crushers, I do not recommend this listing. It was a lot of headache for a beginner like me. I'm good with tools, so I figure it all out. But if you want to avoid the cost of buying more tubes, and quick connect hose fittings, then I would look elsewhere. This was a 2-Star experience, but I hope that my review will help the seller improve on their product.",

I didn't think that was necessary so I read the actual LG manual, and it DID NOT instruct you to turn off the water. After you change out each filter, be sure to press the \"change filter\" icons for 3 seconds to reset the 6-month reminder. Easy peasy.",
