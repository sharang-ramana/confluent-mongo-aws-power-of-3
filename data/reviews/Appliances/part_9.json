Removing the cap after use is sometimes annoying as it the aeropress gets rather hot, and having to grip it tightly to remove the cap is annoying. Generally I run it under water on the sink, but this is introducing thermal shock and may contribute to decrease lifespan of the aeropress plastic.",

    "text": "Last year, (whoop, two years ago now what?) when the weather started fluctuating, I started to get worried about my instruments' humidification.  Not unreasonably it seems as, once i got a decent digital hygrometer into my house, i was horrified with the results.  I actually bought two:  One analog and one digital.  I spent about 30 bucks for the privilege.  On a whim, i decided to buy these little guys for my instrument cases.  I didn't think they would be very good, but I have been wrong.  They nearly match my more expensive digital hygrometer and they are much more responsive than the more expensive analog one.. I put a few in some cases of pricier instruments and have peppered the rest in all the rooms of my house.  They are consistently precise when i put them in the same room, for example, and I have found them to have very good accuracy.  The batteries are button batteries and wear out fairly quickly but I have found them cheap to replace.  If I had it to do again, I might have just bought these and skipped the 30 dollar trip to the hardware store.  I really had no idea how dry it really gets in the winter shadow of my house until i looked.  Glad I looked when i did.  Honestly, I had no idea that humidification during that time would help me personally as much as it did.  I expected my instruments to be okay, but that was also the first year i didn't get sick for a month since i've lived in this house.  I couldn't have guessed how much the air quality would affect me.  Nice tools to have carried into the year 2020 where air quality seemed to be one of those things that people were suddenly thinking about.",

Practice makes perfect. Items like this and steaming thermometers are aimed at new recruits in the coffee army who become frustrated during boot camp and finally want something that just works. Believe me, I understand, but immerse yourself in videos, online advice, and visit good coffee shops (no, not *$s!). Watch the baristas. Some shops offer classes. While it might seem silly to take a class in &#34;milk chemistry&#34; or such, it's not. You'll gain by watching, listening, and speaking with others trying to master the craft.<br /><br />If you love the look of this pitcher, and I don't blame you if you do-- it's cool looking, for sure-- buy it. But if it's just that you're not having luck steaming milk with a new machine, keep working. Avoid gimmicks that promise you a no effort shortcut. In the end, you'll be a better barista if you just stick with it, get the advice and instruction you need, and finally (and you will) master producing creamy microfoam.<br /><br />Cheers, mates.",

So, once I got everything apart I saw that I had to get a new housing--not this igniter's fault of course but my housing shield was completely burned through. Luckily I got one from the local Wolf parts place for a reasonable price (unlike their price for the igniter which was the opposite of reasonable). But this igniter would not go all the way into the new housing. I had to open tabs and do a bit of bending of the sheet metal on the housing to get the igniter in. Not a big deal, mind you. Especially for the price here. Works fine now.<br /><br />Now I wonder though if I really even needed it. Maybe my entire problem was the burned out housing and all I had to do was replace it. For the information: What my broiler was doing was not igniting for a very long time, and then coming on with a mini-explosion from the gas buildup.  Was sort of ok if I opened the door and stood out of the way, but with the door closed the explosion literally blew it open about 6-8 inches. Needless to say I stopped using the broiler. I was told, by a supposed expert, that this was caused by ta bad igniter.<br /><br />I now suspect it was the burned out housing not directing the gas to the ignitor until a critical mass of gas was reached.",

I've tried a few off-brand Aeropress filters, and they aren't as good as these ones. Plus, these are extremely economical, so there's not really a reason to try off-brand filters.<br /><br />There are 350 in here, so they'll last for a year if you drink one cup of coffee a day. They stay fresh, and even after a year or so they make great coffee, so it doesn't hurt to really stock up. They're really compact, so they don't really take up much space at all in your cupboard. I got a filter holder with my Aeropress, and all 350 of them fit nicely in it.<br /><br />If you're looking at this listing, you probably already love the Aeropress as much as I do, but if you don't have one, you really need to get one. It makes the most delicious coffee I've ever tasted, much better than any coffee shop Americano. The coffee out of this is so delicious that I always drink it black. Plus, my Aeropress has already lasted through about 500 of these filters, which is a ton of delicious coffee for a couple pieces of plastic and rubber.",

You will need the largest set of 3 that they sell. Every configuration they sell (except the two smallest sizes) is set up in such a way that you have to buy a lot of sifters even though you only need 2 because you only make your coffee one way--for us it's a French Press.

Any variation on the quality of the brew is a result of my own experimentation. The only negative is that fact that with such easy access to 2-minute coffee, I've tipped the scales into an unnacceptably obnoxious amount of coffee consumption. With great coffee access come great willpower.",

    "text": "This great for what it is! It isn't a super fancy precision-spout latte art competition pitcher, it's a simple functional milk frothing pitcher, in a very small size. I got the extra-small (mini) size, almost impossible to find from most milk frothing pitcher makers, to make flat white, cappuccinos, and macchiatos - particularly flat whites, my daily drink. It's the perfect size to put 4 fl oz of milk in, reaches just to the bottom of the spout, and aerates/swirls nicely. Putting such a small amount of milk in a standard 12 fl oz pitcher makes it much harder to manage the milk properly, and I don't like wasting excess milk. The price is very inexpensive, it hasn't rusted or broken, isn't bent or malformed, and works great at letting me do basic \"latte art\" (ferns, hearts, etc.). Pay attention to the size, the \"mini\" is quite small compared to normal pitchers.",

    "title": "Love love love it! Clothes are cleaner than ever before, and NO SOAP!",
    "text": "UPDATE A YEAR LATER:<br />We are still totally happy with the pureWash. For really soiled items, like the napkins and placemats we use daily, I sometimes do a pre-wash with a tiny bit of soap, but otherwise never use any at all! If we use stain stick on items like shirt collars, I might do a pre-wash as well, but without adding soap, just to get a little more wash time.<br /><br />One time I noticed the clothes were not clean when I removed them from the washer, and then realized someone had unplugged the pureWash. So you can definitely tell the difference. Our washer has an \"eco-cold\" water setting that uses no hot water at all. Apparently, most washers' \"cold\" setting uses a little hot water to help dissolve the detergent. Anyway, the colder the water, the better it works. We couldn't be happier with it. I still don't understand why utility companies and appliance salespeople aren't pushing this item more forcefully.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />We recently had to replace our washing machine, and our local store had brochures about this unit. I'm surprised they didn't even try to sell it to me - I was just intrigued by the brochure and asked them about it. They charged about 25% less than the lowest cost I've seen online. Even though I used to wash mostly with cold water, I wanted it anyway because of its other features. First, it's just a cool gadget. Second, did I say this before? NO SOAP! Third, I no longer need to use hot water at all, even on towels and cloth napkins and cleaning rags like I used to. If you do use hot water, this should be what they call a no-brainer purchase for you.<br /><br />I predict this will be the next big thing in the home appliance industry, as long as the soap industry doesn't find a way to scuttle it. Between this and our new washer, which uses much less water than our old first-generation Neptune front loader, our water and electricity bills are definitely going to go down this year. Plus our clothes look cleaner than ever before. Whites actually look whiter, just like the old detergent ads used to say.<br /><br />This item is definitely a winner!",

If anything it may be a little faster to heat up than the old one, although that may have been age related. Remember that the temperature is regulated by a thermostat - not the element, so don't worry about temps changing in your oven.

The first filters I used were some cheap off-brand, and I think that was the real problem. Since I've been using Melitta natural brown filters I don't think it's probably necessary to roll the bottom of the filter, but I've gotten used to doing it, and haven't tried it without.<br />It's a nice piece of porcelain, and a fun way to make coffee.",

Was disappointed the moment it arrived.  Everything about it is chincy.  All 4 metal brackets were bent.  It was a breeze to bend them back by hand because the metal was so soft (mind you, these are supposed to be the &#34;sturdy&#34; brackets to mount the unit to your joist).  The internal fan unit was somehow installed crooked in the housing when I pulled it from the box?  It was like somebody sat on it, causing it to be pushed into the housing on a 45 degree angle...bending some of the internal parts.  Had to pull it out and rebend to get it to sit flush.  The instructions show 3 screws holding the motor to the fan...but there was only 1 screw.  And it's not as though they just forgot some other screws...there weren't even other holes for the other screws!  Despite all of these things, I still brought it up to the attic to install.  Once I began the electrical work, I just couldn't take it.  The box is SO tiny, it is impossible to fit all of your connections in there...even if you had a 12/2 and 12/3!  Needless to say, I returned it, spent the extra $95 for a Panasonic and couldn't be happier.  The second I pulled the Panasonic from the box, I knew it was money well-spent.  Solid, straight, oversized electrical box.  Unfortunately, this Air King model just didn't cut it.  Actually, it didn't even come close.",

    "text": "5 stars for the initial review.  Longevity is important for appliances...so we'll see how she does over the next months/years.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this hood.  For $300, it is what it is.  It's eye-candy.  Looks incredible and makes a huge statement.  But everything else about it is just kind of \"chincy.\"  Not disappointed, as you have to expect that at this price point.  The buttons don't push down very easily/evenly, the wires are dangling loose in the inner fan (some of their 3M tape came loose), some of the baffles fit loosely thus creating a lopsided effect (a gentle bending corrected the situation) the supplied screws/anchors are a joke.  But hey, it looks incredible, and it does it's job...suck's the hot air.  And for that, I'm stoked to spend only $300 on this!  I've posted pictures for you to see....again, it looks awesome.  The packaging job was incredible.  And it comes coated with a protective film that protects the stainless finish until the final reveal.  It is a little hard to peel off the film on the chimney extension unit.  The other reviews said it scratches very easily...so I installed the chimney unit first, then peeled off the coating.  I had to use a razor blade to score it just below the sight-line on one of the chimney extensions for a \"clean break.\"  Was a little nervous removing it from the box because some of the protective film had its own scratches.  I was worried those would transfer to the stainless steel.  Thankfully, they did not.  The noise is a non-issue.  It's a fan people...it's going to make noise.  On the highest setting, you need to raise your voice if you're standing directly by the hood trying to have a conversation.  But the other settings did not require my wife and I to \"raise our voices.\"  It's fine.  Yes, all of the other reviewers are correct: buy new ductwork.  The supplied plastic ductwork is a joke.  It really is \"easy\" to install in that all you have to do is hang the thing.  Everything else is literally plug and play!<br /><br />One more thought.  We have a 30\" stove and I naturally was going to buy the 30\" hood.  But right before my purchase, I started doing a little more research and many suggested to purchase a hood larger than your stove, to ensure it covers all of your burners.  So at the last second, I opted for the 36\" hood.  SOOOOO glad I did.  Not only does it look better on the wall, it efficiently \"sucks\" regardless of what is cooking on any of the 4 burners.<br /><br />Buy it.  It's worth it.  Let's just see how long it lasts......I'm cautiously optimistic.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/25/2013:  After only our second time cleaning the stainless steel baffle filters, the screw/nut that holds the baffle together stripped, thus rendering it useless.  Obviously, we were pretty disappointed.  I sent an email to customer service asking what the next step of action should be.  They responded that same day with a tracking number and I had a new baffle in 2 days with no cost.  I've never experienced customer service like that.  Really, just outstanding.  I'm still worried that issues like this may arise again, but for the price-point, I have to expect that (one of the same screws on another baffle sits crooked in the baffle, causing it to align poorly).  My wife and I still love this hood...and after this customer service interaction, we're only more pleased with the purchase!",

    "text": "I LOVE, love, love my little washing machine. I can pick it up--even with water in it! It takes more time than a sinble tub and you do have a bit more labor, but the extractor (spinner) removes so much water that the clothes dry very quickly which makes up the time. If you use very little soap--1/2 ounce liquid detergent, I use a shot glass--you can get great results with a 8 - 10 minute wash and one rinse. I would do two rinses, but water pressure is low at this RV park and filling takes a while, but everything is coming out very clean and soft--it's detergent residue that makes fabric harsh. I have never, ever used fabric softener and rarely use bleach, but my clothes are clean, bright, and very soft. More detergent does not make for more clean. Pre-treat stains and go easy on the soap.<br /><br />I am amazed at how much is washes and love its flexibility. I do dirty jeans and cashmere sweaters--spinning is fine, it's agitation that causes shrinkage. The wash tub doesn't have an agitator, but rather rotates alternately clockwise and counter-clockwise like a front loader, so wool is fine--just be sure the wash and rinse water are the same temperature. I hang the clothes in a small room with a space heater and they are dry in as little as two hours for lighter weight garments.",

Especially if you get yourself the &#34;Able Brewing Disk&#34; (do yourself a favor and buy them both at once). The idea of purchasing a manual coffee maker such as this may seem a little daunting, but after about a week of using it you won't even notice the slight bit of extra work you have to put into making your morning coffee. And trust me, the enhancement in flavor over anything you have brewed with in the past will blow you away, and make up for the little extra work you have to do. Not only is this a genius solution for making yourself a single cup of coffee with out wasting an entire pot, but it's a great solution for making a delicious iced coffee. Just brew it directly into a cup of ice, the heat from the brewing coffee will melt the ice and you will have a perfectly balanced cup of iced coffee.

One of them agrees with an older, more expensive humidistat I already owned, and the other does not agree. If the humidity accuracy is not particularly important to you, this one is fine.  And as I say, one of the two is spot on.",

    "text": "After a bad experience with my \"state of the art\" Maytag computer-called-a-dryer, I opted for simplicity this time. One knob (replacement cost for whole timer assembly $90) and one start button (replacement cost $8). Nice, clean look, inside and out. Was at first disappointed that there is no interior light, until I realized I don't need it-  the \"mouth\" is very large and it's easy to see all the way inside. The lint filter (on the top) is large and easy to use. Setup/hookup was simple and fast. This dryer is very quiet, and the heat control is excellent. I just dried several king sized sets of linens, following a very large load of bath towels, and the automatic setting on \"eco\" mode worked as well as it possibly could. Dry time was shorter than with the Maytag, and the items were cool to the touch when I got them out (the cool-down feature really works, and saves gas). With the Maytag, everything was always very hot when I removed them, telling me that the gas was on longer than it needed to be. This dyer is super-easy to use, holds very large loads (you'll never miss that other .5 cubit foot)is economical to buy and operate, and repair (if it ever needs it).<br /><br />What you have to be willing to give up:<br />buzzer<br />LED telling you how much time is left<br />light inside the drum<br />1/2 cu. foot of interior space (compared to 7.0 dryers)<br /><br />What you don't have to give up:<br />Quiet, efficient drying<br />reliability<br />simplicity- all controls are on one dial<br />multiple automatic drying cycles<br />three temperatures<br />timed drying options<br />a lot of cash- Extra knobs or buttons add $100+<br />name brand (like other identical models under different brand names, this is a Whirlpool)",

I have an old refrigerator (~2009) with an ice maker only in the bottom freezer drawer. The double sided tape that came with did not hold up very well. The next morning after the install the tape did not stick allowing the filter to fall to the floor. I ended up using gorilla tape and all is well now. Highly recommend this product!",

They were not at Macys, Kmart, Walmart or Costco. I actually ended up buying a glass coffee pot to use as a teapot at the local Ace Hardware. Ack. Then it occurred to me to find and buy a teapot here at Amazon.com! However, that was comically WEEKS into my 2.5 mo stay. In the interim, we used these tea filters day after day, to make not only a pot of tea (in the coffee pot!), but also cups of tea in a mug. The paper imparts no obnoxious flavor to our tea, drapes easily enough over the side of a receptacle, and allows one to RINSE the tea leaves before steeping. Yes, that is the secret to a clean cuppa tea: rinse the leaves for a few seconds with boiling water (or under your tap's HOTTEST water). I now travel with these filter bags in case a teapot is hard to find. And believe me, they are becoming as rare as a unicorn over here in the U.S. More recently, I have been using these filters to make ginger-soothers. After surgery, if you are feeling queasy, just grate up fresh ginger root, place in this filter bag, and then let it steep with either water or sparkling water to your desired concentration. Works like a charm!",

So if you would like any more than the 2 lbs of ice that it stores in its basket at a time, not makes at a time.  Either way, that would require someone to empty the basket every time it fills which is about two hours.  The only way to produce 28 lbs of ice per day would be emptying the basket round the clock.  The two pounds that it takes two hours to make is less than half of one bag of ice purchased from most stores.  If you're on the edge about purchasing this item, also take note that the seller will deduct their shipping cost from your refund in addition to you having to foot the bill to ship it back.

I was tempted to buy the Keurig commercial K-155 but that is quite a beast and I really could not see that in my humble kitchen. So, I searched for something that might be better and I came across this SS-10P1. I can't say that I am crazy about its design. There is a shiny chrome handle on top that gets immediately smeared with fingerprints and looks terrible. Also, the mechanism that operates the pod chamber just operates roughly and seems poorly designed. Having said all that, this brewer makes a very good cup of coffee for a pod machine. It seems to extract more flavor than Keurig and I think that is because it brews about 30 seconds longer than Keurig. I don't seem to have the problem with splattering some have reported. I'm sure that's because I tend to use relatively tall cups. I'm not a fan of the LCD panel with its garish blue light but to each his/her own. I don't bother with the clock and on and off times as the machine seems to use scant power while it is on. I believe the water heats on demand as there is no rumbling of boiling water from inside at any time. Also, I always use the 8oz cup size so I seldom have to puzzle over the tiny little cup icons to choose something else. I just let the machine stay on all day and I turn it off before retiring. The power switch is conveniently on the side. The hot water and rinse features are useful. Rinse always gives 4oz of hot water while the hot water option is variable by the cup size you select. The functions are similar, but different. I like the big tank. The machine is not unusually noisy but you will hear it. It sounds just like an aquarium pump if you are familiar with such things. It is just a humming sound that is subdued and certainly not louder than any Keurig machine I have heard. My final comment is that this machine is accompanied by a comprehensive instruction booklet. This is a nice touch and, to me, it shows the manufacturer has some interest in customer satisfaction. So I recommend this brewer. If you want the convenience of a pod brewer and wish to avoid the Keurig dice roll of longevity I would say get this Cuisanart.",

The Technivorm is thicker and just upending the filter basket over the bin will drop out the grounds and filter all as one.

The only tradeoff is a tiny bit of sediment (very tiny) in the cup and one more piece to rinse clean. I'm not complaining, though.

It also meets NSF standards 42, 53, and 401 - this refers to the performance of filtration. This means that it is tested to reduce chlorine, cyst, lead, benzene, endrin, carbofuran, plus phenytoin, ibuprofen, naproxen, estrone, bisphenol A, and nonyl phenol. I don't know what many of those are, but they can't be good for you. And honestly, I've not tested my water and although our tap water tastes okay this added filter makew the water taste better, so it must be doing something right!<br /><br />And you really can't beat the price. At about half the price of an OEM, I will be buying the premium version of this every six months. Just wish it was on Subscribe & Save so I can have one delivered every 6 months without having to think about it.",

While they do dry things, the just don't seem as absorbent as a regular cotton towel. I think that may just be my perception because I haven't actually compared the absorbency - it just feels different when I'm drying my hands (again, difficult to explain).  Perhaps it's just such a different feel from a cotton towel that I'm having trouble adjusting, I don't know.<br /><br />I just can't really say I'm crazy about these towels.

I have had it for only 9 months and it already broke twice. The problems with the Frigidaire stoves are their control panels - they just keep breaking. When it breaks you will most likely get error code F13. My advice is DO NOT BUY THIS ONE OR ANY Frigidaire stoves. And to add insult to the injury it takes at least TWO WEEKS to have it fixed!",

Typically we each have 4-5 cups per day, most of which are prepared in 10 cup coffee makers requiring a size 4 coffee filter.<br /><br />We have stuck with Melitta Cones because they do a great job of filtering the coffee.  No grounds make it through the filter and no additional taste is added to the coffee.  These filters are strong enough to pick up by the top without collapsing and creating a mess.<br /><br />Add to that the great Amazon pricing and the fact that they are delivered to our door.  What more could you ask for?",

    "text": "These Melitta Cone Coffee Filters fit our KitchenAid coffee maker perfectly, the configuration of the filters allows the coffee to get full exposure to the water through it, and the price is right.  The combination of a pour over coffee maker using a good blend with these filters results in a full-flavored cup of coffee without the acidic taste.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I have found that if you let the grounds sit in the filter for any length of time, that the filter will tear at the corner when you lift it out, resulting in coffee grounds going just about everywhere.  That gives you an unexpected bit of extra work and is not an easy mess to clean up.  Melitta states that these filters are &quot;double crimped&quot; for extra strength and &quot;guaranteed not to burst&quot;.  I guess that 'bursting' is not the same as 'tearing'.",

My primary use is the range and happy with the output of each of the burners.. I haven't tried using the oven and likely won't until turkey day.<br /><br /> It looks beautiful and compliments our fully remodeled kitchen with other Frigidaire Professional appliances. One thing I'm impressed with is the surprising ease of keeping the stovetop clean.. I primarily cook with coconut oil and so far all the grease and food residue has wiped cleaned w/o issue.. I was fearing I'd have a charred surface in no time but being how easy it's been to clean I reckon it will retain it's lustrous stainless steel surface for quite some time to come. One thing to note is the depth of this as ours protrudes a good inch from the counter. The inch I'm speaking of is not of the stainless frame but of the actual sides‚Ä¶The ‚Äòblack interior' sides . Not a huge deal breaker but when you pay $38k for a kitchen remodel, you want everything to be perfect! Our contractor knew what slide-in range we had selected so perhaps it just wasn't possible to get an exact fit.<br /><br />As far as ordering with ABT goes, it was excellent. We reside in Southern California and no local store, independent or chain could compete with ABT's pricing.. That coupled with paying No Tax (sorry CA gov!) made them the clear winner.. It took about a week to get here and the driver would only deliver to our garage.. We didn't pay for white glove so no issue there. Oh, and huge props to the customer service. The range went on sale within 7 days of us ordering it and after speaking with an agent, they refunded the difference..",

This knob from LONGADS is sturdy and held up well over the thanksgiving weekend when my oven was working overtime.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: $38.99 may seem expensive for one stove knob, but one OEM replacement was more per knob than the price of the LONGADS range knob. Additionally, the Whirlpool OEM knobs are not steel core, nor would I replace the OEM knobs again because I have no doubt they would melt again, which makes the LONGADS DG64-00473B Replacement Stainless Steel Gas Stove Knob a value in my book.",

The only reason they were getting rid of it is because they moved to a home with a built-in dishwasher, so I absolutely snatched this up the second it was available. I want to emphasize that I bought this dishwasher *two years old*, and it still gets the job done flawlessly. I have had no issues with water leaks, dirty dish spots, or machine errors since owning this, and my countertop has literally never been cleaner (because dishes are the WORST CHORE EVER and I used to put them off until I couldn't anymore). This dishwasher makes apartment living SO sweet and SO much easier at the end of a long work day. It's absolutely worth the money; If you take care of it, it will take care of you.",

Unlike most other refillable cups, the Eco-Carafe lid is thin enough to allow the top of the brewer to close.<br /><br />The Eco-Carafe makes nice coffee albeit a little weak. The problem is the Keurig 2.0 brew temperature is very low. I am on my third replacement K560 for that reason. Keurig states the brew temperature is 192 degrees for k-cups and 197 for k-carafes, but all three Keurig k560,s have water temperature of 172-174 degrees at the dispensing needle.<br /><br />If you use a fine to medium grind, it will still make a good carafe of coffee. It also helps to select \"Bold\" when you brew!<br /><br />Perfect Pod said they will have paper filters to fit the Eco-Carafe. This will help to slow down the brew. Until then I'm making my own filters.<br /><br />I have a large mug, and I like to brew 16 ounces at a time. The Eco-Carafe allows me to use enough grind for a nice mug of coffee.<br /><br />Oh, it's the color that allows this to work in the Keurig 2.0<br /><br />I highly recommend the Eco-Carafe!",

Sadly, this makes a sub-par cup of coffee.  Not only is it tedious, you have to go through all kinds of extra steps that aren't part of the manufacturer's intended instructions to get it to make a decent cup of coffee.  Most coffee comes out weak unless you put a used k-cup at the bottom of the thing before putting in the filter to slow the flow of the water.  Plus, you gave to pack in a LOT of coffee to get a reasonable cup of coffee.  Then, so it doesn't overflow and put grounds in your cup, I use a toothpick to kind of bore out the center so the water can flow in a little better.  You can stop the leakage for the most part by putting a rubber band around the very top where the lid screws on, but if I'm paying as much as $20 for this, then I'd like it to work without my having to put in so much effort.  I've also read several reviews about how quickly these break, and while mine has not yet broken, I can see where it will.  Very shoddy construction.  It's a disappointment.<br /><br />To sum it up, you CAN get a good cup of coffee out of this, but it's going to take work and practice to figure it out.  Nothing like just plopping in a new k-cup and closing the cover and pushing the button...",

    "title": "Love this ice maker!",
    "text": "We used to have one of the bullet ice makers and it worked great for our family of 4 for over 2 years, but it finally died and we wanted to replace it with one that provides even more ice so we never have to wait for a batch to get done. This ice maker is amazing and makes so much ice that we never run out! It is true that the ice comes out looking like a candy bar in full sheets, so to deal with that I bought a double walled ice bucket with lid for the countertop. It has a stainless tong and a scoop so I use the tongs to pull the ice sheets out of the ice maker, put them in the bucket, then use the scoop to break them up. It's easy and lets the ice maker continue to make ice while we use up what is in the bucket.<br /><br />Just one warning: the top filling feature was a little bit of a pain for me with how my kitchen is set up because you can't fill it easily if the ice maker is under top cabinets. I had to rearrange things on my countertop so I could put the ice maker where there are no top cabinets and it's perfect placement now. If you have top cabinets all around your kitchen with very few open areas, it might pose an issue for you when it comes to filling the machine and would be very inconvenient.<br /><br />I can't review based on longevity because at this point I have only had this ice maker for a month. But what a great month it is has been!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Clear ice<br />it's a workhorse and makes a ton of ice every day<br />It's a good looking machine<br />Easy to clean (instructions in manual)<br />Pretty quiet when it's running (see caveat below)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Big ice blocks come out so you have to have a system in place to break them up<br />Cannot fill easily under top cabinets<br />Takes up more counter space than a bullet ice maker<br />Can be a little loud when the ice falls into the basket (it startles my dog if he's in the kitchen and it's hilarious)<br /><br />This ice maker is working beyond my expectations and I am thrilled with my purchase. I highly recommend it for people who love ice to the brim of every drink!",

    "text": "It's definitely not the raciest or interesting product, but it sure comes in handy when your dryer lint has gotten out of hand and you need to deal with it! My electric bills have been off the wall and my house very dusty and dry. I have 2 kids and 6 pets so I do laundry all the time, literally every single day. I was completely boggled by the higher electric bills since I have been changing all my lightbulbs to LEDs, bought new more efficient appliances, etc. until the power co installed a smart meter that allows me to go online and look at when energy is most used. I realized from the charts they provide that my dryer was going bonkers, drawing so much energy, and since I do laundry every single day, it was making a muck out of my electric bill. We detached the back dryer hose and piles of fluff came out. We started cleaning the aluminum duct only to realize that it was so full of junk, we decided to just replace it. But that left the pipe leading up and out of the house to deal with. To help with the long pipe, I bought this magnificent lint remover. We didn't even use a drill because it is so tight behind my dryer so it is hard to maneuver, but even using it by hand, tons of stuff came out anyway. Unfortunately we have to have a wire cage over our vent that leads outdoors or birds get in and we will need to get out on the roof to get the lint off that. We will clear that out and then run this brush through to the inside to make sure we got everything. Lesson learned to check on the dryer vent more often and head issues like this off before they start. Without this tool there is no way we would have been able to get all the lint out of the pipe as it has two elbows running out of the house. It gives me peace of mind that we are starting again with a cleaned duct system and we know now to schedule in regular maintenance. When I was growing up, I never remembered my parents cleaning the back of the dryer (though they probably did I guess and I missed it) so it didn't occur to me that it could be such a problem in just a few short years. I am so glad that modern technology alerted me to a potential hazard in my home and that this product was available for purchase to help deal with it.",

Then the little guy sprung a leak, it was out of warranty, and we decided to donate it and buy a bigger machine. This one IS bigger, fits a lot more.  I have done about 6 loads so far, and if things change I will update the review.  This time I bought an extended warranty for it, so it will be going back if something goes wrong.<br /><br />It is louder than my last one, you can hear the motor rev up when it does the spin cycles.  In general this is better, it revs up‚Ä¶in increments, helping the load to balance in the bin before hitting top speed.  Love this, versus my old machine that I would refill (a waste water) when it was out of balance to re-distribute the clothes.  It does mean the motor can get a little loud when it does this, but not so much that you worry about neighbors hearing it or can't have a phone conversation in front of it.  Just enough for me to notice it was more than my last .9 cubic ft machine.<br /><br />One other thing, if you set it for 1 spin cycle - that doesn't seem to include a full rinse (I expect it to fill the bin, move clothes around in fresh water, extract water and then spin).  It seems to trickle water over the clothes as the bin moves around a few times and then it spins at high speed to do the final cycle.  Sort of confusing, and I am still learning to see if there is another pre-set program that works differently, but I find choosing (2) spin cycles solves this issue.  I expect a rinse cycle to do more, I guess!<br /><br />Otherwise it's pretty good.  I can do larger loads, with room so the clothes can move around and get clean.  Will update if anything changes as I keep the machine longer.",

Especially when we get a couple of feet of snow...doing laundry at home is so much better.  It fits everything nicely, even large 'thick' towels.  I have also done CalKing sheets in it too, full set w/ pillowcases at the same time.<br /><br />I notice the machine can get out of balance with heaver/larger items, so sometimes I need to split those up, but in general it works out very well.  No leaking (I have had it about 4 months so far), if it gets out of balance the machine automatically adjusts itself and sometimes I don't need to do anything at all.  I find it re-balances the load better than I can - it is pretty smart - which surprised me the first time it did that!<br /><br />It's a keeper and a lifesaver!  My one gripe is I should have bought the slightly larger version of this machine - I might have been able to get my quilts done in it.  Right now, I will have to still go to the laundromat a few times a year to get larger stuff like that washed.",

I bought a portable washer & this dryer and was so thrilled they both came within a day of each other.  And now I am dancing through the house exclaiming \"Where have you been for the past 3 years??\".  I should have done this much sooner when I first looked these machines up on Amazon.  I live in a small cabin that does not have a washer/dryer hookup and it has been a nightmare going to the laundry mat in town.<br /><br />This dryer has been wonderful, and it is plowing through the laundry that has built up with ease.  Super simple to use, lots of options depending on what you are drying, quiet and venting out the back door is convenient.  I bought a larger dryer than the washing machine because I wanted to make sure everything could tumble around and dry without wrinkles or wet spots.  So far it is great!  I know once I get through the bags of laundry, and to a normal schedule of only a load a week, it will be sent from heaven as far as I am concerned.  No standing at the laundry mat, no icky stuff coming out of the machines, no icky people (yeah, even the super small rural area I live in has those).",

I replaced the heating element & it took ~1/2 hr start to finish & wasn't hard... I'd say it's 'medium' difficulty depending on your handyman ability. Some will find it very simple to do. My old heating element did indeed have a broken coil, so I felt pretty good about the diagnosis. After installing the new heating element the old dryer is working great again. We've had it fixed for ~a week & done ~10 loads & so far so good. Be sure to wear rubber gloves to keep skin oils off the coils. Be sure to thoroughly clean the inside of the dryer (esp. the tube that holds the heating element). All that dust in all those places is a serious fire hazard. Good luck. I'm thrilled I spent ~$35 & ~1/2 hr & have a good working dryer again... Would give 5 Stars, but longevity is yet to be seen...",

I've found that sometimes the grounds have a tendency to leak out of the bag if it gets completely submerged. Cleaning is easy, with just a rinse and some air-drying.",

I love that you can easily squeeze plates and such in between the bars. They appear as if they're stretching out of shape but as soon as you remove the plate, they go right back to the way they were before - no shape lost.<br /><br />If you ever do need to use the sink or the side that this is on, it rolls up very easily. I used to just place dishes in the sink to dry, but often they'd still be wet hours later because the water would gather underneath inside the sink. This allows items to drip dry so that isn't a problem. It's perfect for our household.<br /><br />A free sample was provided for evaluation and review.",

No electricity needed and I don't have to mess up all the pieces involved with the coffee maker.

Now, I know to slowly pour in the water a little at a time.

Losses one star because even though It has a pump it takes some work to get it to start draining after any water comes out the end its good to go and will pump no matter where you have the hose, also the spin dry soap rinsing connection to run water through the spin dryer to remove soap reside leaks ever so slightly. So I end up with a small puddle on my bathroom floor every time I do a load. Over all very good and perfect for apartment living.",

As the book  says  do not  over load it you will  be  sorry.okay as for the  machine  flaws<br /> Needs bigger  wheels  to  move  around  over carpet  a break would  help  out  alot  there. Otherwise  you  have to tip it up from  the  front  its 70 pounds  your  tipping.  Also the clip on drain  hose is not made for a sink  in the kitchen  . It's made for the laundry  room  like what is up with  that. I used a string  .no biggie<br />Also when you  get it out of box it says pull  straight  out of box like who in the world  can do that. Its 70 pounds.  Oh well  its done.  Wish the hose came attached  like the big washers  do .I mean there is  room  to  do this and  it could  have  been  done. Also  the  fact  is  the  hoses should  be  longer  especially  since  they  are  supposed  to  portable  not stabilized just saying  that.  You will  need  tools they don't  tell  you  that  they should  have  .a wrench  and  level.  And someone  strong  enough  to  lift it up from  the  package.  They don't  tell  you  that.  They should.  There's  a  drawer  for soap  in  the  back it doesn't  say that  I guessed  it.<br />It doesn't  use gel packs very well  but I figured  it  out .as I only  have  them . It needs  a  handle  on top for mobility  would  help a lot especially  when  moving  it around  in a small  space  as I have  a  small  space.<br />It doesn't  matter  what  kind of soap  you  use it preferably  use powder  it likes  it  better  . It doesn't  matter  .I tried  most  of  them.  Can use warm  water  thru cold water  your  in control  of  it. It's not quiet loud also .<br />I thought  my neighbors  were  going  to  complain  by knocking  but have not yet . Make sure you follow  the  instructions  on  load sizes  if you  don't  it will  leaking  .its a awesome  machine  once  you  get  used to  it  and  machine  flaws  which it can't  help  by the engineering design.<br />Its awesome<br />I recommend  it highly.<br />Its really  easy to  use once you  figure  out  the  button  for load sizes.

As a matter of fact, you can still spin this piece of silicone after you apply it to the capsule. Definitely reusable, still produces the Crema, but you must you use a fine or espresso grind. You must use a Vertuo capsule, the instructions tell you to fill at 70%, this will produce a very weak cup of brew. Probably why most reviews for flavor are poor. To brew a true 7.77 oz of coffee, the original capsules are packed with 12.5 grams of fine grounded coffee beans. A 70% fill will result in using 8.75 oz, a single espresso capsule contains 7 grams of coffee and a double espresso capsule contains 10 grams of coffee. The only way you're going to get the flavor you are accustomed to, is to use the same amount, (weight wise) of grinds (each scoop is about 3 ounces) that the capsule originally came with. Keep in mind that each capsule also has a unique bar code on it. This bar code determines brew cycle time, water temperature, water pressure, and how much water to dispense.<br />So in a nut shell, have multiple capsules available to test with, make sure to use a fine grind, don't use an old capsule that has been laying around as mold has already been growing inside the capsule. Clean right after using.  I will explore other options",

Wanted to wait to review it after long use. I LOVE IT!  It has worked very well, has kept everything cold, and the freezer section has worked very well in the summe, in spite of having to function in a very hot library. The previous 'fridge froze up, but now works very well in the basement 'living room', its original placement. That reinforced my initial thinking that this unit would work very well. Have not had any trouble at all. It is also frost-free.<br />Maybe I am just really lucky, but think that this item is very well made and insulated. I keep ice cream and ice cubes in the freezer, and it keeps everything well frozen. Overall, I made a really good purchae, and highly recommend it. I would also add that I keep both sections full, which probably contributes to the unfailing function of this much-needed and used 'fridge.",

I would not miss this step because what I read is that odors build up in these HD machines.  I also leave my lid open and the little detergent drawer open to air it and dry it out after each laundry day.<br /><br />I only use liquid HD detergent; powder may not always dissolve.  I also don't use much detergent, depending on the soil level.  For our everyday clothes, less than half a cup is fine to avoid any excessive residual soap issues on the clothes after washing.

    "text": "09/29/2017 UPDATE<br />Finally got the top compartment fixed, problem with the sealed unit so fortunately still under warranty (5 years for sealed unit).  The repair time was about 6 weeks for the January 2017 failure.  On July 7, 2017 the top compartment again stopped cooling. It took two weeks to get a technician this time. It was the same tech as in January. He shook his head and said he was going to report it as defective.  It took until September 15, T E N (10) weeks before Samsung finally issued a refund for the purchase price. Those 10 weeks were pure ridiculousness, and all without a refrigerator.  Customer Service for defective units was only available M-F from 2PM-5PM, 3 hours, ET.  It generally took 10-12 redials just to get in the queue, then another hour MINIMUM, on hold, to get to a live person.  We had all of the paperwork turned in within two weeks of agreeing to a &#34;buy out&#34;, but another 8 weeks for a refund. The only additional compensation was $200 for spoiled food. Nothing for the 10 weeks of almost daily grocery store trips, inability to keep/use leftovers, and &#34;fast food&#34;.  All of the people I've dealt with have been very nice, but that did little mitigate the total customer service failure on Samsung's part. Call after call, for updates, with typical responses of &#34;the claim is being reviewed&#34;. They offered me a buyout so what's to review? More weeks of &#34;well, everything is here, I'm not sure what the hold up is. I'll make sure you get a call&#34;. And you guessed it, no call.  I really, really like the layout of this fridge. I have a ton of Samsung electronics in my home with no issues. I never could have imagined such a complete and total failure of an appliance from product to service. Until they get their act together, just don't.  Attached are the photos I was required to provide as part of the process-label removed from interior, and cord cut.<br />UPDATE<br />We've had this refrigerator for a while now. About a month ago the top compartment stopped cooling. It still isn't fixed.  There is an issue with the sealed unit which is under a five year warranty. Unfortunately, Samsung has been unable to locate a certified technician to fix it. So I currently have a $4000 cabinet. I loved this refrigerator but am sorely disappointed in Samsung customer service.  Think twice before purchasing any Samsung product until they get their customer service back on track.",

    "text": "To say I'm pleased with this coffee maker is a understatement. I've owned several Cuisinart coffee makers in the past. Including the version that this one replaced. After 6 years of use, it was time for a replacement. Of course my search began and ended with Cuisinart!<br /><br />Unlike many of the reviews posted. I am pleased with the changes I've found compared to the previous model. Noticeably the area where the Pod is inserted is now flat and much easier to wipe down. While the water reservoir no longer blinks to indicate low water. You'll find notification displayed on the screen indicating when the water is low. Minor tweaks that in my opinion makes this coffee maker a great choice.<br /><br />Easily change from inserting a ready to use Pod with the included insert fitting easily by lining arrows up to brewing station. Should you prefer to use your own coffee grinds, simply remove the Pod insert and use the supplied coffee filter basket. Comparing to previous model, the filter is a bit larger/taller. Should you prefer a stronger cup of coffee allowing for more grinds. The exposed buttons are user friendly changing between default setting of 8 ounces to less or more depending on your brew. Easily program coffee maker to have your coffee ready when you are by setting the clock. With a default setting to auto shut off after 30 minutes should you forget. Use hot water button for hot tea or if you just need hot water for another use. Another great feature I've found is there is no lag in heating up to brew your coffee. Turn the machine on. Simply open the Filter/Pod insert area, close and hit the appropriate button. Freshly brewed coffee/cappuccino or hot tea within seconds<br /><br />Overall I feel this in a excellent choice for all your coffee needs. The design is sleek and looks great on any counter top. I have found this to be very user friendly. As with any new appliance, I do recommend reading the enclosed User Manual. If you've owned a similar model previously. It's virtually the same operation. Set up is easy. Adding water to the reservoir is made simple by removing tank or my choice in using a larger measuring cup without moving the entire tank. Just remove lid and add water.<br /><br />Included you'll find the coffee maker packaged well and shipped inside a sufficiently protected larger box. User manual. One carbon filter and a reusable coffee filter pod. You can easily find additional of each should you require replacements or wish to add additional reusable coffee filter inserts.<br /><br />My vote is a solid YES! I'm a huge fan of Cuisinart. The brand hasn't let me down yet and because of that, my first and only choice is Cuisinart. I hope my review has been helpful. Please click below to let me know. Thanks for reading and Happy Shopping!!!<br /><br />MissKelly.xo",

Aside from that, it worked and installed well, you can make bends and compress it, and it keeps your preferred shape. Careful not to twist the hose at one end, keep both ends the same so it's not twisted. Before you unroll it, I suggest using a sharpie and marking a center line so you know, then it won't get twisted when trying to straighten the flex tube! It will flow better too because less restriction! This is cut to size as well! Overall happy, no local stores had this. If local stores carried more items, they wouldn't be closing.

It never increases with amount or time.  Out of all the years I have used these, the brown ones were awful stinky to me and gave the coffee a not so fresh taste.  I won't tell you what it reminded me of, but not good worse than cardboard.  The white has a Good Taste the Most Positive thing about them and that they are USA made.  This is the first year though that my filters rip through the bottom, someone sent in a photo of exactly what it looked like for me and this was enough times that I just started using two filters instead of one.  I don't get filters ripping, but only get half of what I pay for.  It is my choice though, and I pay it because it is worth a Great Coffee in the morning or anytime along with Demur Sugar.  I gave 3 Stars for half the amount.  I think that is fair.",

Coffee time is my favorite time and I love the smell of coffee and the taste I savor, but I can smell the filter.  Yes, it seems that way.  Why?  Don't know.  It smells like a paper bag to me.  Now how would you like to drink your coffee through a paper bag ?  Now you know.  I originally was afraid that would be the case, but decided to just see when you got more for the brown ones.  More yes, but no more period.  I love my coffee and this makes coffee not putrid, but not as satisfying.  I don't recommend these over the white ones.",

So I switched to these to see if I would like them better.  Number one it supports US Workers, number 2 it is just totally a better filter, it doesn't bust and number 3 is the fact the filter is made of a different kind of fiber that is stronger, has not awkward taste or fibers in your coffee and is actually quicker dispensing it.  Too the point I had a coffee that was all over the counter first time.  Not use to the quickness and all I can say is it has to be from the material that it is made from, tasteless, stronger, made in the USA.  The price too is less than the Brand name Melitta even when made here in the USA where you usually pay a quality wage for a decent days work.  I'm totally happy.",

You can always put them in a storage bag later if your really picky about it.  If my box were real damaged, I would have done that and reasoned that at least the product was fine.

    "text": "One of the biggest problems with making my own espresso has always been cleaning up afterwards. Grounds always end up working their way inside the machine, and it takes tools to truly ensure it's all out. I'd been using the same machine since before Amazon was even around, but recently replaced it and decided to see what was new in accessories, too.<br /><br />My new machine came with few extras, just a drip tray, couple different insert sizes for the handset, and a scoop/tamper. Before, I would've thought that's all you really needed. I was wrong.<br /><br />When I first saw one of these filters, I knew I had to have one, and I was right. A carafe, espresso cups, a milk pitcher... all those things are nice, but unnecessary for making a superb latt√©. This filter not only keeps the machine far cleaner, but causes more evenly distributed waterflow throughout the grounds as well, ensuring a better brew, every time.<br /><br />While I've always tried to ensure my grounds were evenly set before I tamp them, no amount of fuss with needles or other specialized tools made to separate coffee lovers from their money, can distribute those grounds in a way that totally prevents channels from forming. Those channels are visible evidence of uneven waterflow through the grounds, meaning not all grounds are getting the same flow. These filters are the only things I've seen that can fix that. They're not perfect, as they do have edges, but it's as vast an improvement over no-filter as espresso is over drip coffee (yes, that's my opinion - and I'm sticking to it!)<br /><br />These filters should be as essential for making espresso as the handset, or at least the tamper. Such a serious improvement should always be incorporated into the basic process and included as essential equipment!",

    "text": "I downsized and moved from a house into a 500-square foot studio apartment in the city back in February. One of the sacrifices I had to make -- or so I thought -- was private indoor laundry at home.<br /><br />This little Haier changed that for me.<br /><br />It is the smartest $200 or so that I have spent in a long time.<br /><br />It is so cute and small, it fits right into my walk-in closet next to the bathroom. Works like a charm, I just move the washer out of the closet and a couple of feet into the bathroom, snap the hose onto the bathroom faucet and put the drain hose into the tub. I can do a whole week's worth of laundry in a couple of hours.<br /><br />It holds roughly 1/3 to 1/2 of what most people would consider a normal load of clothes. In one wash load, I can do maybe 4 or 5 pairs of pants, or a full set of queen sheets (fitted bottom and flat top sheet); two large bath towels and two face towels.... you get the picture.<br /><br />It is too small to wash my comfortor so I just do that once a month in the building laundromat downstairs.<br /><br />I figure this machine has saved me at least $5/week in washing machine costs; probably more than that. So at this point the machine has already paid for itself.<br /><br />I've never had any leaking problems except once when I experimented and washed a blanket that was too large for the machine. There was a small puddle on the bathroom floor afterwards; no big deal.<br /><br />As long as you don't overstuff it, you shouldn't have any leaking issues.<br /><br />It's also important to me that this machine is nice and new and CLEAN... I don't have to wonder who used the machine before me or what they put in it.<br /><br />On a lighter note, this washing machine has also turned out to be something of a conversation piece. Whenever I have guests over and they see the washer next to the bathroom, they always comment on how cute and convenient it is.<br /><br />I'm debating whether to get the Haier portable dryer; for now I use my shower curtain rod as a clothes line or I just do a bunch of loads of laundry, and take them downstairs to the laundromat dryer in one shot.<br /><br />But it is so nice to have the option of doing all my laundry entirely in my apartment if I choose. Huge money saver and convenience. I highly recommend this machine.<br /><br />The only (small) complaint I have about it is not really a complaint but more of a question. The drain hose and water line are very short. I wish they were a little longer so that I didn't have to move the washer into the bathroom (three feet away) to hook it up to the faucet.<br /><br />I'm thinking of going to Home Depot and seeing if I can finding extensions for the water hose and the drain hose that would be long enough to reach into the bathroom.<br /><br />If anyone has had any luck with that, please let me know.",

I did a bunch of my work uniforms, socks, undies, tees and a couple of sweaters. Put like a tablespoon of detergent in the wash. That's really all you need. This machine's spin dryer is very quiet - if you fill it correctly! IF! I also made the mistake of putting this on my kitchen floor to drain in the sink not realizing that it drains by gravity! This is VERY important! I had to manually coax the drain pipe in the right direction because it was too heavy to elevate once water and clothes are in. I will be buying a sturdy table for it cause it does shake a bit if not properly filed and arranged with clothes. My clothes came out perfectly fine, soft (didn't use fabric softener) cause I haven't figured that softener part out yet. This was my first time using this machine. Drains very easily once propped on a table. I'm so happy I don't have to walk in the rain to another building just to was my uniform and undies. Not sure if I will use this for sheets...if you spin dry about 3 or 4 times, the clothes come out completely dry. I just did some clothes for the full 5 mins and hung dry but even then, they came out almost dry. Well worth the $$!",

I set it on the counter overnight and the next morning I took the stainless steel filter out, dumped the grounds out in the garden and then rinsed it off in the kitchen sink Easy Peezy.<br />I saw someone mention the residue in the bottom of the mason jar, that residue is full of all of the beneficial goodness in coffee (magnesium, potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants) and it doesn't affect the taste or my enjoyment in the least. Actually I'm glad it's there.<br />The great thing about cold brew is if you make it a little too strong for your liking it still isn't bitter and you can easily add a little bit more filtered water to your finished coffee to tone it down a little bit.<br />I like it being kind of strong because then I can make a latte of 50% coffee and 50% almond milk froth it up and it is so good.<br />In the picture you'll see I used it to make bulletproof coffee and let me tell you it's the best.<br />Highly recommend it.",

It runs better then a 1990's machine, but it's not the 4 towel drying monster that I've read... Two large towels will range in time between 1.5hrs to 2 &#34;for me&#34; in the North-East (70 degree day). Also, a regular full load of laundry will take 1.5 hours, where a 1/2 load will take 45mins. Living in 1 of the largest cities in the US (with 1930's wiring) the 110V / 1400W (translates to 12.72 amps) hasn't caused a fire in &#34;my apartment.&#34; At the end of the day, I don't think that I can find a better product that will work with my electrical constraints, so although my expectations are tempered... I like this machine.<br /><br />FYI:<br />I need my machine to be very portable, so I put it on a 11.5&#34; x 18&#34; mini-dolly. Although it barely fits, the smooth legs do slip off, so I needed to lock the dryer's mini legs in place. I did this by screwing down round mini tins to the dolly's corners, and wrapped velcro (2 sided, no tape) around the machine and dolly. I used the soft side of the velcro against the machine (prevents scratching), but I also used a little tape-down scratchy pieces on top of the machine pointing up. This way the velcro not-only-sticks-to-itself, but it also doesn't shift aroound on top of the machine.... Finally, I cut a piece of Yoga-mat a little larger then the dolly, and place it under the machine to prevent dryer movement during use...",

As a matter of fact, a portion of it sits ABOVE the bowl and rests on<br />the outer lip which makes this unusable.<br /><br />The smaller ones , the heating elements do go into the bowl but not flush either, its slightly off so the pans are<br />a bit lop sided but not as bad as the larger one that doesn't even sit in the bowl. So in these smaller ones, liquids<br />will bunch up more to one side, so its not even.  Not acceptable either especially if what you are cooking, needs<br />to be in a flat level pan.<br /><br />I've already opened up a return and I'm sending these back.  What's annoying is that if you look at the questions people have asked about these, one of the answers there CLEARLY state these outer diameters are 7.5\" and 9.5\" which is NOT true, and those small amounts that these pans are off by, make a BIG difference!",

They not only lower the noise of our washer and dryer dramatically, but they also prevent our washer from moving around. Before, our washer has the tendency to shift a little after every wash. If left unchecked, the washer would shift next to the wall and start causing banging noise, which could be heard all over the house. Now, we can finally have a peaceful, stationary washer and dryer.",

You just have to attach the adhesives, pull out the plastic tabs on the batteries, and stick it to your fridge. When installing, make sure the gap between the two pieces are not too far apart or it will trigger a false alarm. Ours ended up sticking out a bit as you can see from our photos. The alarm itself is fairly loud, not mind numbingly loud, but loud enough for us to hear from two rooms away on a quiet day.",
