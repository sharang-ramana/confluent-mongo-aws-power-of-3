I just wish the arrow was more pronounced, as I missed it & poked a hole in mesh. That is on me. It is minor & still works. I have have never used a reusable k cup before, but knew it had to go in a certain way. What can I say …it was early morning & had not had my coffee yet! I like it, I just wonder if it will last for the long haul. Gets the job done & is much more economical than constantly buying disposable k cups. Priced fairly ($4.99 at time of review).",

Water filter is shaped slightly different than others I have used, but fits & works, so not a worry. It seems like a good deal for 2 water & air filters.  If flavor improves a little more, I would say this is an excellent deal for the filter combination, as filters for my LG refrigerator tend to be pricey.

    "title": "Upscale Appearance, design could use improvement",
    "text": "We chose to upgrade to the KitchenAid brand when we needed to replace our existing stove. The KitchenAid appliances appeared to offer a higher end when it came to fit, finish, and operability. However, after a few weeks of use, we began to notice some design aspects of the KSGB900ESS range that could have been improved:<br /><br />Ignitor \"clicking\" noise:<br />When turning ON one burner, ALL burner ignitors begin to CLICK simultaneously. This was found to be odd. It would seem that, although not used, the ignitors for the other four burners are being used which would result in an earlier life span. We contacted KitchenAid and were advised that this was \"normal\".<br /><br />Stainless Steel finish:<br />The area surrounding the top control panel is finished in a high-end glossy polished stainless finish. This then makes these surfaces very suseptible to scratching. Due to the material, the smallest scratch cannot be removed. This identical observatiion applies to the flat surfaces surrounding all of the burners. Again, one must be VERY careful when cleaning in and around the burners so as not to scratch the finish.<br /><br />Burner Grates:<br />The cast iron grates interlock. Care must be taken when disengaging them for cleaning. They are heavy, yet manageable. Both grates must be removed in order to properly access and clean the flat surfaces in and around the burners. It's not feasible to attempt to reach inbetween the grates to clean when they are in place.<br /><br />Warming Tray:<br />The bottom warming/storage tray is quite small in height. Although this feature may be good for baking and the \"keep warm\" mode, it's not conducive for storing cooking lids and other cook ware safely without encountering interference with the underside of the oven above it.<br /><br />Recess for Gas Feed Piping:<br />The back of this model has an opening to accomodate a gas feed pipe and shut off valve. However, the height of this opening is approx 8\" high. Existing vertical gas feed piping that exceeds this height will prohibit sliding this range against the back splash unless the piping is modified (by a licensed plumber) to bring the height down to fit beneath the opening at the back of the range.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />Overall, this KitchenAid gas range, with convection feature, does reflect a high-end design and is quite an attractive appliance. Care, however, must be exercised throughout the operation of this range in order to maintain it's original appearance. From a cost aspect, it's an expensive piece of equipment which must be cared for. The burners do, in fact, produce a significant amount of BTU\"s which may be a trade off for all of the above combined with the convection feature.",

    "text": "Year 2: If you run your Newair constantly (like I do) you can count on replacing the water holder  (the piece that attaches to the rotary motor pump housing) and water pump every year. Year 1 I replaced the water holder and water pump. Year 2 the water pump went out. I replaced that. Shortly after that I noticed the water holder was cracking again. I was going to try and fix it with Loctite but then the compressor went out. OK, time to replace the entire unit as in total I already spent $90 replacing parts. I decided to get the same one because all of the other brands (except one that got really good ratings but is too big) will have the same problem i.e. cheap plastic parts etc. So I yanked out all the parts from the old one that I can reuse in the replacement.<br /><br />(Prior Post) I updated my review from last year. So a little over a year has gone by. The water hold that holds the water for freezing into cubes cracked down the side where it attaches to the motor. Apparently, this is a common problem. Hopped on Youtube and luckily a guy posted 3 videos on how to fix it. After spending 2 hours wrangling to get the thing out, and waiting for the epoxy to dry, I spent another hour getting it put back together. It started making ice (awesome I thought), then quit. It cracked even worse down the side. So I called today for a replacement part from Newair. $20 plus $9.95 for shipping. What a ripoff for a nothing plastic part.",

For those unaware Whirlpool has purchased Maytag animana and is now manufacturing the replacement parts for these units so you will find multiple part numbers weather there are a Whirlpool number a Maytag number or an Amana number that are all the exact same part. For example, this part was sold under Whirlpool part wpy 54414 but it's also listed as part# AP6024203(likely the AP stands for Amana even though the product is a Maytag).<br />This machine is over a decade old and the only repairs it's required so far was a new belt a few year back and now this pully wheel. We decided to replace the belt (part# wp40111201 AKA part #  AP6009126) while we were in there as it had some cracks starting and we might as well save ourselves the hassle.<br />The pully did NOT come with either the washer or microscopic retaining clip but that's okay as our old ones were still in great condition.<br />It also doesn't come with installation instructions (super simple, washer threaded onto post of idler arm, add pully wheel, second washer, and then retaining clip) for the pulley itself or how the belt should be rethreaded onto the pulley wheel or the motor mount. YouTube will be your friend for putting the belt on properly, check multiple videos to find the one that works best for you.<br />This repair was relatively quick (for a gas unit you will be doing the threading blind, check youtube to see what I mean) and seems to have resolved the issues.<br />Just remember, always unplug your electrical connections and in the case of gas dryers like ours, simply shut off the natural gas valve at the back of the until as well until the repair is completed.",

I also have no idea what the 3 inch foil sticker covering an odd round bulge in the back is for).  All the damage seems cosmetic except the leveling foot which makes it wobbly even though I eventually put wobble wedges under 4 points to get it as steady as possible.<br /><br />The freezer cooled nicely, I have no frost or anything at this point though it is humid out and in my house for the past week. It was set at setting 5 (1 is the warmest, 6 the coldest), and ice cream is firm but not impossible to scoop so it's just right.<br /><br />The shelves are surprisingly roomy (the interior space is closer to exterior size than I had imagined), and the bin is large and well made.",

    "text": "So this is acceptable. It works, and will likely stay put (I used the included adhesive patches but there are screws as well).<br /><br />There are a few issues with this, though.  It certainly feels cheap. As long as it does continue to work that's not a huge issue. The main problem is that the number dials are really bad. They are way too close to each other to begin with. Additionally, some numbers roll easier than others and the usual tactile \"confirmation\" that you have the number you are setting in the right spot (in the middle) is virtually non-existent. I am the one that knows the combination and it takes me about 5 times longer than it should to get it open. If I was trying to deter myself from getting in the fridge it would work well as there's been a couple times I went to get a drink from the fridge, remembered this was on it and decided it wasn't worth the hassle and didn't get a drink from MY refrigerator.<br /><br />If the build quality was a little higher, the number wheels easier to turn independently, and there was a confirmation that the number you selected was in the right spot for it to read as the right number-- this would be a 4 star (even 5 star) product. Hopefully it can be improved!",

I then filled two clear glasses.  One with bottled water and the other with the filtered water from this filter.  I set the both on a white sheet of paper and had my wife look through the top of both glasses side by side and pick the one she thought was from the filter.  She picked the bottled water as being darker. Point made.<br /><br />I completely understand others feeling that since this is made in China it is of questionable quality.

For one, the only way to retrieve the ice is through a front dispenser that takes a bit of time. There is a small flap at the top where you *could* scoop it out, but it wouldn't be easy. My other issue is that once the ice is made, it isn't kept cold so it needs to be removed soon. With a $400 price I think it should have a refrigerated compartment.",

With this, you just grab however many eggs you need and that's it!  One great thing about this product is that you can adjust it for just one layer if you need more room in the fridge (it comes with a lid, so you could store things on top of it).  It is sturdy and I love the way it looks in my fridge.",

You basically set an analogue style switch as to how much water you want pumped out into the air, but it's really not set-and-forget the way some are: this winter is a perfect example, how in the mid-Atlantic region the outside humidity has changed a lot, and of course you don't need it on when the air is naturally at 40%+.  I am pretty disappointed about that (apparently you can buy an add-on) considering this is a great brand.  Everything else about it is really nice, too (except that it is bigger than some other models that can hold the same amount of water).  That said, it does fill easily and it works well.  It also looks better than most.<br /><br />As usual, you have to change the wicks now and then (you definitely need to dry them out well on the off-season.  You can soak them in a vinegar solution to cull the mold effect.  I tried the wickless types, and they clog my HVAC filter with calcium deposits to the point where it stops working after just two weeks, which obviously makes those types a no-go for my house.  Distilled water works, but is more expensive than wicks over time (perhaps unless you happen to have a still, although it takes time and [electric] energy to distill all the water you will need).<br /><br />Worth a look.

They lift up and snap closed once you place your coffe inside. At first I couldn't figure out how to place them, and its actually very easy to use! You just drop the pod in the pod compartment, close the lid and it falls into place like an actual pod. Just make sure  before closing down the lid on the pod you reposition the pod with the open slot pointing to the back so the needle that punctures the disposable coffee pods doesn't puncture your k-pod piece when you push down on the lid. Mine didn't come with instructions so we damaged one of the pods. But just make note this is compatible with the universal k-pod coffee makers not the verisimo or the single smaller serve mini cup coffe makers. Im very happy with the size of this product its just like an actual pod but reusable. Great buy!",

The first few batches of ice smell and taste a bit plastic-y, but after running a few batches through, the ice is perfect. It is small crushed up ice, which I love. It starts producing ice almost right away. It is perfect for our kitchen, especially when we have guests.<br /><br />The instructions are easy to follow, and set up is super easy. From taking it out of the box to my first ice cubes only took about 15 minutes.  I had to run about 3 batches of ice before the strong plastic smell was no longer present. It comes with all the hardware needed to connect it directly to a water supply. I am happy with the quality of this purchase, and I would order this again.",

You do get ice made fast, but it doesn't make it automatically. I have to press the button each time I want ice. The water tastes good, and it is quick. I bought this for occasional use in my home bar, and for that occasional use, it works fine. For everyday use, this would be so frustrating. The ice maker doesn't keep the ice cold, so it melts if I don't use all the ice it makes at once. For almost $400 as the price, I would think it would be more like a mini freezer for the ice it makes.",

    "text": "This ice machine does what it says it does; it makes ice, and it dispenses hot and cold water.  It does have a few flaws, though.<br /><br />First, it gives you indication as to how much ice is left. It will tell you when it's full, and indicate when it snot full.  But it can be 95% full or 2% full, and the only way you will know when it's empty is when it stops dispensing ice. You can't look inside because there is no way to open it and look.<br /><br />The ice is on the soft, wet side. It's not as cold as it could be; it's close to melting. This makes it soft for chewing, but it melts easily and waters down drinks quickly.<br /><br />The machine is pretty noisy while it's making ice.<br /><br />The ice has a plastic-like chemical taste to it even after running a couple of gallons of water through it. The instruction said that it should take several quarts of water to get all the dust and flavor out, so this may yet pass in time, but it's pretty strong and unpleasant.<br /><br />Other than these issues, well, it is indeed an ice machine. It's far from perfect, but it makes ice pretty quickly and it can provide about 5 glasses full of ice at maximum capacity.",

Don't know about you but nothing drives me crazy more than the washing machine door not staying open and having that horrible smell.  This comes in 2 pieces that easily screw together:  the magnetic disc and the long arm.  The arm is fully bendable & nicely made, so depending on how much space you have, you can open the door all the way or just a few inches.  And there is no right or wrong way in bending the arm.  This isn't going to scratch your machine and is easily removed.  You won't lose or misplace it because its magnetic.  Definitely aids in airing out the machine and preventing any buildup.  Makes you wonder why manufacturers don't automatically include a gadget like this.  Gets 5 stars from me!",

This works perfectly fine as a replacement for the paper filters. The size is slightly smaller than the #4 paper ones but it holds enough ground coffee and works with no issues. There is a wire handle for easy removal to dispose of grounds (coffee grounds are good for roses if your soil is not already acidic). The only consideration is that if you are using a very finely ground coffee like Lavazza some sediment occurs and settles in the bottom of the pot. Since Lavazza is my favorite coffee my solution is to brew a little extra coffee and not use the bit at the bottom. Easy to clean, comes with two filters.",

I have the vent venting into the room, with a dehumidifier going, so humidity doesn't exceed 55 percent. I clean the lint filter between each load. Spin cycle on the washer works; the clothes are only damp when put into the dryer.  Water collects in the venting pipe, I have to drain out between loads. Not certain what's happening, since all of the vents are clear and the ambient humidity is average. I suspect the lower heat compared to other dryers is the culprit.

    "title": "Side of the device \"melted\" and the fan shakes so hard the unit turns off.",
    "text": "We were super excited about getting the new ice machine and things were going great, until they weren't.<br /><br />Received the ice maker approximately 28 Nov 21 - Did not plug it in and put it into service until approximately 24 Jan 22. Hey, we have some neurodivergence in the house so it took a little bit to get there. This ultimately was the \"downfall\" for being able to return this product as the return time ran out on 31 Jan 22.<br /><br />The good: This thing pumps out ice at the rate the manual and listing states. It has some cute cubes and they are small enough to fit most of the reusable bottles/cups we use here in the home.<br /><br />The not so good: After 31-days of use the fan (located on the back right side of the unit) seems to be loose or broken and now, at least once a day will rattle so loud and hard that the unit shuts down. There is, what appears to be, a spot where the unit overheated and \"melted\" the side, to the tune of an approximate area of 6\" x 4\" as notated by the picture with the ruler. The unit began to \"auto shut off\" about 2-weeks into use, but it was not consistent and we could not figure out why, shortly after is when we noticed the melted section. So it seems there may be a defect (possibly just with the one we purchased) in this one.<br /><br />Maybe this unit does not support being plugged in 24hrs a day? I may have missed that in the instructions. However, for a $129 unit to last 31 days, just long enough to get past the return point, that also does not seem right. We plan to find a new countertop ice maker, likely from a different company, we expected more from a Frigidaire product.<br /><br />We do hope you have great success with your item if you choose to purchase this product.",

    "title": "Good performance and easy to use, but rather pricey compared with similar options",
    "text": "Overall, this is a nicely designed, good performing ice maker. It makes bullet type ice (the type of ice that has a hole in the base) rather than cube ice. As with any bullet ice maker, the ice is rather cloudy instead of clear. But, the ice from this is a bit more clear than other bullet ice makers I've tried. Not a lot, but it's noticeable.<br /><br />Bullet ice tends to melt quicker and doesn't look as nice as cube ice. But bullet ice makers are not as expensive as cube ice makers, and I've found that bullet ice works fine. Put it in a drink and the drink gets cold. That's pretty much all I expect from ice.<br /><br />The build quality feels solid. The controls are well laid out and simple to use. It has a very large LED timer readout that, while it looks nice, doesn't really add much to the functionality of the machine. It offers two ice sizes but there's not a huge difference between the \"small\" and \"large\" cubes. Since bullet ice melts quicker I always use the large size option.<br /><br />It has a self-clean function but it's not a replacement for a good cleaning every so often with diluted vinegar, especially prior to storing the machine. Operating sounds are very hushed. You can hear it, but can easily have a conversation in a normal voice standing right next to it.  The flaps that move the ice into the bin operate almost silently (other than the sound of the ice dropping in). It's not all that much of an energy hog, using 120W of power.<br /><br />The first batch of ice takes about 9 minutes; subsequent batches are a minute or two quicker.<br /><br />I like that it has the drain plug on the bottom rather than the lower side. It makes it easier to empty out the leftover water. Just move the machine so the drain plug is over the sink, pop the plug and let it drain. You don't have to hold the machine while it's draining, unlike some other models.<br /><br />The only feature I didn't test is the timer (you can set it to start at a certain time). I can't envision ever needing such a feature. It does shut off automatically if the water level gets low or the collection bin is full, so you don't need to watch it even without using the timer.<br /><br />The only con is the price. There are other similar bullet ice makers that are just a tad smaller but cost notably less. This is not priced outrageously, but it's not a bargain either.<br /><br />4.5 stars (half star down due to the value issue). I'll round up to 5 since it works well, feels well-made, makes ice pretty quickly, is quiet, and is easy to maintain.",

It sometimes makes ice just fine (and it is mostly clear ice) but most of the time it fails to freeze properly, resulting in little or no ice production. Additionally, the water pump doesn't work consistently -- sometimes it pumps just fine; other times it just dribbles out the water. All of these issues occurred within the first couple of days of use, so it was not an issue of things wearing out but rather things not working from the get-go.<br /><br />The external appearance is pretty attractive, with stainless steel cladding all around. But even that has its faults, with small but noticeable blotches that look like rust on the back of the machine. And despite it being under the Frigidaire brand, the user manual is terrible, with limited info and poor English.<br /><br />Fortunately I was able to return it.  I opted not to get a replacement since I had no confidence that the replacement would be any better than the first one. I'll give it two stars since it has the potential to make better quality ice than a bullet ice maker, but the poor reliability makes it a gamble if you get one that works.",

    "title": "A fine performer but has the same limitations as other bullet ice machines",
    "text": "This is a fine performing bullet ice machine. The controls are easy to use, it works quickly, and ejects the ice neatly and properly each time. But, as with any bullet ice machine, the ice itself is not of ideal quality. It's cloudy and melts quicker than clear ice. Clear ice machines do cost a fair amount more (the Frigidaire model is probably the least expensive one but it costs nearly twice as much as this) but the ice quality is better. Still, for the price, this is a good performer in the bullet ice category.<br /><br />The overall fit and finish is decent. The gearing for the ice ejection is all plastic, but that's to be expected for the price. The manual is pretty poor, but it's not hard to figure out how to use the machine. Operating sounds are hushed (other than the loud bang the ice makes when it is ejected and hits the catch container). It has a self-cleaning function but I can't tell what it actually cleans -- it seems to just recirculate the water a few times. I imagine it is cleaning (or attempting to clean) hard water deposits on the innards of the machine, but can't be sure.<br /><br />There's a drain plug which is handy for getting rid of the water when you're done with the machine. It is located on the bottom, so you have to position the machine so the front half is hanging over a sink so it can drain without making a mess. Not the most convenient place for a drain plug, but it works.<br /><br />Although this has all the limitations of other bullet ice machines, it works well and is easy to use.  For the price it's a five star performer. If you are willing to spend a bit more, however, it's worth looking at clear ice machines since the ice quality is better.",

    "title": "Solid performance in an easy-to-use (and keep clean) format; amazingly quick cooking speed",
    "text": "This is an impressive performing induction cook plate that offers a number of handy features. While the temperature control feature is not super accurate, it offers excellent performance for the price in an easy to clean and attractive format.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with induction cooking, the prime benefits are that it's fast, energy efficient, and consistent. The only real downside is that it only works with certain cookware such as cast iron or steel -- basically, if you can stick a magnet to the pot, it will work. This cook plate allows you to use induction cooking without having to get a new stove.<br /><br />The cook plate looks really nice. I have the full glass version, and it's attractive and sleek looking. Plus, the glass top makes it a breeze to keep clean.  I especially like that it sounds a warning beep, and then turns off if you try to use it with non-compatible cookware.<br /><br />The controls are intuitive, and allow you to set the cooking level either by wattage or by temperature.  The latter option is very helpful if you want to heat up water for hot drinks, but don't want it to reach a boil.  You can set the temp for (as an example) 180, and the cook top will cycle on and off to maintain that temperature.  However, the temperature settings are not super precise. When setting it for 180F, the water actually reached 195; when set for 140, the water reached 150.  It's not a significant problem unless you're making something such as green tea, which needs very precise temps to brew properly. For typical use, the temp variations I encountered were not at all significant.<br /><br />(Note that while the temps are displayed in Fahrenheit, the control has a C for Celsius next to it.)<br /><br />The speed of this is amazing. I can take 12 ounces of cold water and have it hit boiling in about one minute. It's very versatile with regard to pan sizes, and is able to work with pans that have a flat base ranging from 4.75 inches to 10.25 inches.<br /><br />I've tried this on a number of tasks from the very simple (boiling water) to tasks that require very even heating (omelets) to high temperature tasks (wok cooking) and also low temperature tasks (braising).  I've been very pleased with the cook plate's performance across the board. It's fast, reaches (and maintains) high heat, provides for a nice consistent low simmer, and is simple to use.<br /><br />While the temperature control could be a bit more accurate, for the price this is a solid value. It's an easy way to use induction cooking, or provide for that extra burner you always seem to need when cooking for a crowd.  Very highly recommend.<br />[Sample provided for review]",

    "text": "I have a few ice ball molds and they all get the job done. This one, however, is the most practical and well-designed one of the bunch.<br /><br />Rather than just be a round mold with a cover, this mold has a foot which makes positioning it in the freezer far easier than other molds. The two molds can be stacked on top of each other in the freezer or set side-by-side depending on the space you have available.<br /><br />Using it is simple. Just fill with water to the indicated fill line, put on the top cap, and you're done. To release the ice ball just run the frozen mold under water for a few seconds, and it pops out.  I had no problems getting the ice to release cleanly from the mold.<br /><br />The ice ball it makes is a 2.5 inch ball. Great not only for drinks but also to keep pitchers of tea cool in the summer, for adding to dog or cat water dishes (keeps the water cool and gives them something to play with), and many other uses.<br /><br />Once you start using the large ice balls you won't want to go back to regular ice cubes. This mold is well designed, solidly made, and much more practical for use in the freezer than other ones I've used. Highly recommend.<br />[Sample provided for review]",

    "text": "While the intended purpose of this is for tapping HVAC lines, it is a fantastic carto punch. It supports the carto far better than when using a standard punch or a saddle valve, which means there's far less (or even no) distortion in the barrel. That allows the carto to slide in easily, even when using a tank with a hard plastic or metal cap.<br /><br />The small hole size also allows me to punch 3 holes, which is great for 100% VG juices.<br /><br />(With apologies to Amazon - I got this on an auction site for a lot less. Check around before purchasing).<br /><br />Another brand to look at is the Supco BPV31 [[ASIN:B0002YTQ8G Supco BPV31, 1/4\", 5/16\", 3/8\" Tubing]]. It's functionally identical, but having used both the Quick Tap and the Supco, I prefer the Supco. The needle seems to pierce better in the Supco, leaving a cleaner hole. The Supco is also a bit beefier in construction, and has a built-in gasket that helps hold and protect the carto. Again, check an auction site -- I got the Supco for $5 shipped.<br /><br />But either will do the job, and will do it well. A must-have if you punch your own cartos.",

    "text": "While the intended purpose of this is for HVAC line tapping, it's hands-down the best carto punch available. Zero distortion of the casing, even when punching multiple holes.<br /><br />It takes just a bit of time to learn how to use it. I started with a junk carto and practiced until I got a feel for it. I put some photos up to illustrate usage and the resulting size of the punched hole.<br /><br />Basically, just loosen the three outer bolts, slide in a carto, tighten the bolts (they don't need to be real tight), then turn the center bolt with the included allen wrench. You'll feel the needle pop through the case. Back off the center screw, loosen the bolts, and done! After a couple of practice holes it becomes easy as pie.<br /><br />Unlike other line taps, the Supco has a gasket that helps hold and protect the carto while punching it. Very nice construction as well. Note that while the Supco site says their products are made in the US, the one I got was made in China.<br /><br />Make sure you get the model BPV31. Supco makes a variety of models for various size tubing. The BPV31 will fit a 510 carto.",

It looked to be made of the same material as the original pad, but the size was way off. The size is about 11 long and 5.5 inches wide. The pad is designed as a loop, so if you cut it in half, you'll end up with two 11 by 5.5 rectangles per pad. There are a total of 2 pads per pack, so you'll get four 11 by 5.5 rectangles that can be then cut down to fit.<br /><br />It was very easy to cut this down. It's thick, so a knife works best, but some heavy duty scissors would work as well.<br /><br />It works just as good as the original pad. Best of all, it's very inexpensive - I can cut this down to make 8 pads that fit my humidifier, so I have enough replacements to keep me going for a few seasons of use at a MUCH lower cost than the \"real\" pads.<br /><br />It is treated to help prevent mold.<br /><br />If you need a square or rectangular pad for a cool mist humidifier this may be an option to look into.",

    "title": "Impressive performance at a good price",
    "text": "As usual, I spent a whole lot of time looking for a replacement dishwasher. Looked at a lot of models, and narrowed the choices down to models from Whirlpool, Bosch and KitchenAid.<br /><br />The high end Bosch and Kitchenaid models were great - read nothing but good things (for the most part) about their performance, and they are very, very quiet. But, cost was a factor, and I just couldn't see paying more than one grand for a dishwasher (and some are a LOT more than a grand!).<br /><br />Looked into Whirlpool since they get excellent reliability ratings from the \"consumer\" magazine. This model caught my eye since it offered a fully-integrated panel (i.e., the controls are hidden) and some nice convenience features. So far, it has been a top-notch performer.<br /><br />The potscrubber feature works very well, and is identical to the one on the Kitchenaid (not unexpected, since Whirlpool owns Kitchenaid). Love the movable cutlery basket! You can hang it on the door for more room, or put it on the front or side of the lower tray. If loaded properly, silverware comes out clean no matter where you put the basket. If, however, you tend to just toss in forks and spoons and not arrange them, you'll want to put the basket on the lower rack so it gets more direct spray time.<br /><br />The interior is light gray with a tile-type pattern. It's plastic, so it's not as fancy looking as stainless. But, I care more about what the dishwasher looks like from the outside, and the stainless steel outside looks great. It also has a unique feature among hidden control models in that the steam vent is on the front of the machine, and not the top. That's important to keep the steam from hitting the bottom of your counters. Can't figure out why everyone else doesn't do it that way.<br /><br />Many different cycles to choose from including regular, adaptive (which uses sensors to figure out what to do), high temp and sanitary rinse. Lots of nice little touches, such as foldable tines and clips to hold light plastic items so they don't flip over during the wash cycle.<br /><br />Noise levels are very low. No, it is not as whisper quiet as a higher end machine, but the sound level is not at all objectionable.<br /><br />Excellent value - lots of features, works well, looks great, holds a boat-load of dishes, and has lots of convenience features. Can't ask for more than that!<br /><br />>>>>>>>Update June 2010: It's been a year since I've had this, and I'm still 100% satisfied with the machine. I run about 2-3 loads per week and so far I've not had one item not come out perfectly clean. I use an enzyme-based detergent and the rinse-aid. Settings that work for me are adaptive wash with the high-temp option.<br /><br />I usually run the machine after dinner and then unload it the next morning. To save on electricity, I don't use the heated dry. I find that dishes come out completely dry, but plastic items are sometimes damp, especially if it's humid out. Usually the plastic is not damp enough to warrant a towel dry except for a few pieces that I have with a recessed base - enough water collects in the indentation to warrant a quick pass with a towel before putting it back into the shelf.<br /><br />I've tried the sanitizing rinse and that does help dry items a little bit better. I tend to use that only when I have really greasy dishes and want an extra high temp rinse to ensure all grease is gone.<br /><br />Zero mechanical problems so far. Hope this keeps up!<br /><br />>>>>Update March 2012:  Working as good as the day I bought it. Very pleased!",

There also was a two percent difference in the humidity, but I'm not preserving fine wine, so I'll call it good enough.<br /><br />It does require two batteries, not one as the product description currently indicates.

When connected to the sink you can't use the sink faucet and have to find another one (bathroom) if you need water.

    "text": "As of this review this product costs $484.15.  Personally, I think I could find a dyer with the same no frills for less money elsewhere.  It's not a bad dryer by any means, but if I were looking for one to purchase in a bricks and mortar store, I would probably pass on this one.  Why?<br /><br />1.)  The door is hinged on the side (right side).  I like dryer doors to be hinged on the bottom so that I can use the door to drag clothes out and have lying on it while I sort through them picking out what I want to fold up first.  With this dryer you either have to keep reaching inside to get the clothes or pull them all out at once and place somewhere to fold.  I have a tiny, and I mean tiny space to work and a dryer door hinged on the bottom is a big help to me. Also, with a dry door hinged on the side means you will have to be sure it can sit next to your washer and have the door open so that you can place clothes directly from the washer into the dryer without having to go over the top of the door into the dryer.  I think it's stupid to hinge a dryer door on the side and not the bottom, unless you use a wheelchair.  A door hinged on the side will certainly be easier for those in wheelchairs to access......maybe, I'm not really sure about that.<br /><br />2.)  The door is hard to open and shut.  I have doubts that an elderly person, or someone with some types of physical problems could easily open and shut this dryer door.  I have to really yank on it for the catch to release, then I have to push it hard for it to shut close.<br /><br />3.)  It has no buzzer to tell you when your load is finished drying.  Not that it's a big deal, but for the cost of this dryer I think they could have included a buzzer.  If I'm working on the computer for example, while I have a load drying, I would like very much to hear the buzzer so that I can get up and fold the clothes while they are still wrinkle-free or put another load into it.  Otherwise, I'll probably forget about it and they will stay in the dryer and compact under their own weight and wrinkle until I remember they're in there.....whenever that would be.<br /><br />4.)  It would fit nicely into the space where the old dryer was if the metal vent hose that came with it was much, much shorter.  Right now, it's sitting about 2 feet from the wall because the metal hose is so incredibly long.  I eyeballed it this morning and with it unextended it's still at least 3 feet long.  My husband is either going to have to cut it down to size or else buy another one that will work.  I can't have the dryer way out from the wall just because the hose they supplied is too long.<br /><br />THE DELIVERY PROCESS:<br /><br />I was called two days before delivery by J.B. Hunt and asked a few questions such as: how many steps will the dryer have to be taken up, what day (choice of two) would work best for me, etc...  The person I spoke with was very nice.  The next day I got an automated call confirming delivery and a phone number to call if I needed to change it.  The day of delivery I got a call from the delivery man saying he would be there within the hour and they arrived about 20 minutes later.  My window for delivery was between 11:00 and 3:00 pm.  The truck pulled up around 1:00 pm, well within the window scheduled.<br /><br />The delivery men (2) were very nice, but s-l-o-w.  I didn't think they would ever get the dryer put into place and the other one taken out to the garage.  And they wanted to chat, which I really don't care to do.  Also, they couldn't attach the dryer vent hose to the standard-sized vent hole saying the hose was too large to fit into the vent hole, and that they weren't authorized to make such adjustments (???!).  As far as the \"installation process\" is concerned, that was just delivering the dryer, plugging in to the wall outlet and turning it on for a few seconds to see if it would heat up, which it did.  And they left some black greasy marks on the top of it which they didn't bother to wipe off.  Later, I discovered that the dryer door will not stay open so the feet of the dryer will have to be adjusted to make it stay open so I can put wet clothes in, and take the dry clothes out without having to wrestle the door open with my knee.  It's very annoying right now and I think they should have checked for that.  I know I don't want them coming back so I'll fix it myself.  To their credit, they were very careful about not banging the dryers against the walls while taking them in and out of the house, and they were careful not to mar the floors by placing a mat down for protection.<br /><br />OVERALL: I'm not exactly thrilled with the dryer, (or my delivery experience) and can't really use it right now since the vent hose needs to be connected and the door won't stay open on it's own.  Why they (J. B. Hunt delivery) don't carry different lengths or sizes of vent hoses, or take a level to ensure the dyer is sitting properly is unknown.  I do like the \"no bells and whistles\" aspect of this dryer, except I wish it had a buzzer.  It's very basic, and not hard at all to figure out how to use, but I have no idea how long to expect it to last and I think it costs too much.  My old Kenmore was still going strong after 17+ years and I'm keeping it in case this new one fritzes out. I did dry a load of towels and just let the dryer vent inside the house because I really wanted to know how good it worked.  It dried them just fine.<br /><br />UPDATE 10.25.14 - I have used this dryer several times a week and it has held up very well.  The door problem was fixed by my husband and remains open until shut.  I have increased the star level to 4.",

We tried to hook it to our kitchen faucet but neither the male or female set up fit, so we are using the bucket method, which is super easy. I just have to keep an eye on the water level during the inflow but other than that, go about your business and come back to sparkling clean dishes, glasses and silverware. The noise level is minimal. This dishwasher is so easy to use that we looked at the booklet one time and that was all we needed. I do wish the heated dry cycle was shorter because it is 60 minutes no matter what cycle you run the dishwasher on. Our kitchen was not built with room for a regular dishwasher and I was so tired of hand washing. This ICUIRE Portable Dishwasher is the best gift I have given myself. Worth every cent, in my opinion. I have it on a cart with wheels and bring it to my sink when it's time to do dishes. Easy Peasy. Fantastic product found on Amazon.",

Note that there are no rounded slots for each egg; eggs just lay next to each other and come forward so you can easily remove a couple without having to pull the tray out.<br /><br />The angle isn't steep but I'd still recommend taking care when moving the unit around if it has eggs in it. The lid doesn't come all the way to the front of the unit, allowing for easy access to the front eggs. It will allow me to stack some lightweight items on top of the lid as needed.<br /><br />I only gave 4 stars for the individual durability and sturdiness ratings because the plastic doesn't feel super rigid but given how we use the unit and that it's likely to be in the frig 99% of the time, I'm not concerned about these aspects.<br /><br />Pictures show the old egg holder next to the new one for size comparisons.",

    "text": "I bought this locally four months ago after getting fed up with constantly cleaning kid's fingerprints off my stainless steel fridge, and I've been very happy with it ever since. The black stainless isn't entirely fingerprint free, but it's close enough. Every now and then I see some smears, fingerprints, or water marks near the ice maker but it's easy to wipe clean with a damp microfiber cloth, and it doesn't ever need to be polished so it's a lot easier to maintain than my old fridge was.<br /><br />I love being able to have the milk and most commonly used condiments in the door in door. It's easy to access and it latches securely when closed. The alarm features on this fridge are great too. Now I don't have to follow after the kids to make sure they closed the door properly because the fridge will let them know if they didn't.<br /><br />The flex drawer is a wonderful feature as well. It has it's own temperature controls and I find it just perfect for storing lunch meats, cheese, and snacks for the kids to reach. The freezer offers a lot of storage space and it has a pull out drawer on the upper part just like my GE Profile did, so I use that section to store frozen vegetables and use the two large bins below for meats on one side and frozen pasta, deserts, or other items on the other.<br /><br />There are a few features of this fridge that are less than optimal however. For example, the door in door bins aren't adjustable, so what you see is what you get. The storage cubicles on the side that has the ice maker are very narrow so you can't fit much into them, and the fridge doesn't have enough room for tall items, so if you have more gallons of milk, juice, or wine than will fit into the door in door bin you'll need to lay them down on a shelf to make them fit.  Despite those minor inconveniences I'm very happy with this refrigerator and I wouldn't want to go back to regular stainless steel again for anything!<br /><br />Update 8/7/2016: An alarm on the unit's front control panel let me know it was time to change the water filter. In case you wondered, it takes the [[ASIN:B003N1ZSYG Samsung Da29-00020b Refrigerator Water Filter]].  You'll need to shut off the water line before changing it, which means you either have to pull out the heavy fridge to do it, or shut off the main supply line for the entire house for a moment (which is what I wound up doing). After removing & replacing the filter be sure to run several glasses of water through the fridge to flush the new filter as well as remove air from the lines, and then you'll be all set for another 6 months.",

    "text": "I'm very glad that these cups exist because I wouldn't be able to enjoy my Vue without them, but they're not perfect by any means.<br /><br />The first time we tried a regular K-cup with this it leaked grounds into my coffee maker.  Happened again the next time we tried it, so that was the end of trying that!  We have been using the inner basket and our own ground coffee ever since and haven't had ANY problems at all with that, so that's the way these work the best in my experience.<br /><br />Using our own ground coffee is preferably for me anyway since it allows us to control the type of coffee and it's so much more economical than buying individually packed Vue cups or K-cups anyway.  Just be careful if you try to use a K-cup in this K2V-Cup. If it leaks when you try it it isn't you, it's the cup!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/27/2015: The lids of both of these we own have now snapped off, but we are still able to use them by simply placing them back on the top and pressing down lightly. Just wanted to mention that in case yours break so you know you might still be able to use them as well.",

It looks the same as the original part and was simple to screw in. Just drain the first gallon or so of water after installing any new filter and you'll have crystal clear filtered water for ice cubes and to drink for the next 6 months. I'm in the Texas Hill Country and without a good filter our ice is cloudy and water tastes pretty undrinkable.  My ice cubes are clear and the water tastes great after installing this filter, so I couldn't be happier.

    "text": "I was able to get these two premium metal filters for AeroPress to evaluate at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion, and I gave them a thorough tryout today making several cups of coffee in my AeroPress.<br /><br />First of all, I'm a serious coffee drinker and drink quite a few cups each day, so I found these stainless steel filters to be much more hassle free than the paper filters which tend to get crimped or bent easily.  The metal filter fit snuggly into the cap and it took no additional effort to press a cup of coffee than with the paper filter, but there was a difference in the taste of my coffee.  It's richer when using the metal filter because the (very) fine mesh of this filter lets the natural oils come through to flavor my coffee better than the paper filters, yet no grounds were able to get through it at all. None! It was a wonderful cup of coffee each time I made one.<br /><br />So, now I don't have to fool with the paper filters or reorder them anymore.  These stainless steel filters are well made and cleanup was simple as it could be - just dump the grounds and rinse the filter off under the tap and it's ready to use again.  I highly recommend these permanent filters!",

I had wanted to contact the company, but when I called a recording told me I would have to email them due to covid-19. Now, I hate doing dishes. This is a fact. So, even attempting a second cycle on some dishes and not having them come out really clean was disappointing. I'm iffy on if I should return it because having to repackage it would be a pain.

    "text": "This unit is OK I guess for the money.  The 1st time I used it, it made ice & filled the bin & shut down & never came back on.  I tried a couple of things from the rather sparse troubleshooting guide to no avail.  As a last ditch effort I plugged it back in one morning & at work, applied to return it.  When I got home that evening, the bin was full of ice and it's worked fine ever since.<br />Apparently the mere threat of returning it to China was enough to get it to do what it was supposed to.<br />It is VERY noisey and mine appears to have a rattle somewhere near the fan.  If I rap the side of it near the fan it stops for a few moments but then starts again.<br />The ice it produces is very porous and melts very quickly in a drink...which is OK since I just use it for water but in mixed drinks and soda, etc, it would water it down very quickly.  You can put some of the ice into baggies & put in your freezer to harden but that's why I bought this unit...I didn't want to take up space in my small apartment-sized fridge to make and store ice.<br />The way the system is designed, the unit doesn't hold the ice below freezing so after dumping into the bin, it begins to melt.  The water from melting goes back into the water supply tank and is used again to make ice over and over.  I strongly recommend using filtered water like a Brita pitcher to fill the tank.  The ice produced will not have a taste to it like using tap water.  The water in the tank will also last longer.  The instructions recommend draining the water from the tank every day.  That would be a total pain and using filtered water I just do it about once a week or every few days if I'm not using a lot of ice.<br />Bottom line, if you're wanting an ice maker to use behind your home wet bar, keep looking and spend the money for a higher quality unit.  If you just want some ice in your water, this unit is OK for that.",

Fount this range and had to get it, HAD TO!  . . . and DID!<br />Almost like the Maytag except push button controls instead of rotating knobs.  Meals are done so much faster with better temperature control.  Takes a bit of learning, but not too bad.  Thing to learn first on an induction top it NOT to leave it.  It heats up fast, so stay with it until you KNOW how it behaves.  Will will overcook much less at the beginning.<br />Cooking more and going out less too!<br /><br />I put on a protective coat on the top, which has never been removed as the magnetic field does not know that it is there.  Teflon top cover if I remember correctly.  Bought one other but the heat made it deform too easily while cooking.  It shrinks back to normal, but the expansion is so much that the surface under the cook ware can cause the cookware to not sit perfectly flat.  The other material, teflon, does not have that problem, if I remember correctly.  Cleanup on the top is a breeze.<br />The top cover is sold as a drip bottom protector.  Use on there and clean up, so far, is just a quick wipe off of the material, not the oven itself.<br />Bottom slide out tray is smaller than the old one but adequate.",

It fell to the floor, broke into many pieces, and I chose to return the item as it was garbage. Literally at this point as Amazon did not want it back.<br /><br />See, this thing looks like a good idea and then they send two zip ties. It also requires the purchase of another hose rather than, I don't know, having one side be ever so slightly larger to accommodate.<br /><br />As Amazon didn't want it back I decided to see if there was any way to make the product work with the parts as shipped, or if enough duct tape could be employed. What I found was the only somewhat useful part was the metal filter. You can use that plate, it fits on the end of an exhaust hose, and just point the hose somewhere in the room. There's literally nothing else of use with this product.<br /><br />I will also note that that metal filter, it doesn't catch a whole lot. I mean even if the box worked properly the filter you're supposed to pop out and clean regularly is probably going to be pretty clean unless your dryer's internal filters are garbage.<br /><br />So yeah, interesting idea, if I got what I ordered it probably wouldn't have earned garbage title, but two zip ties and a box that fell apart in my hands... no.",

    "text": "Firstly, the punchline:  this is a supremely economical purchase. I have already saved A TON because I use my mini Keurig on the daily. However, it takes some maneuvering in order to obtain a sufficiently dark cup of coffee without any gritty bits.<br /><br />The specifics: I have a mini-Keurig that I ADORE, potentially more than life itself. Potentially more than that, I like to save money, so I purchased this coffee filter after a friend of mine (equally addicted to coffee) recommended it. I thoroughly enjoyed the trial and error it required to get a solid cup of coffee, but perhaps there are less insane folks out there. So, here goes the summary of my lab notebook, to save you some trouble (stating, once again, that this is for the mini-Keurig series. results may vary):<br /><br />1) Do NOT pack in the grounds. This will make the coffee really gritty and very weak. The worst.<br />2) Try not to overfill the filter. Also, I am probably just a spacey scientist, but it was not at all clear that the filter thingy does NOT go into the Keurig setup for the throw-away cups. You take out that bit, but the filter in its particular holder (comes in the package), and then finagle that whole thing into the Keurig. Again, that may be intuitive for some of you, but it took me more time than I will admit on a public forum to figure that out.<br />3) Don't leave it for the next morning. The grounds are very stubborn after they've settled.<br />4) If you get your coffee beans ground at your local coffee shop, ask them to make it as fine as possible. Still trying to think of a reason why this consistently makes tastier coffee, but so far only have a phenomenological evidence.<br />5) Put a little less water than even the minimum, if you can. I only have a Keurig mini, which says the minimum is 6 oz. Forgetting even that I have no idea what an ounce is, don't worry about these. If you put in too much water, you get a lot of murky ground at the bottom of your coffee. That said, I've also noticed if you pack in the first spoonful, and keep the next spoonful loose, these gritty bits tend to disappear.<br /><br />I suppose some folks wouldn't like to go through the trouble of figuring out exactly how the filter work with their Keurig--if that sounds like you, this would be a tremendous hassle. If you enjoy the chase, go for it! It gives you something to tinker on during your lunch break.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend it especially for the environmentally and monetarily concerned.<br /><br />EDIT: December 2013<br />After a few more months of experimentation, I have found that the filter does EXCELLENTLY for loose-leaf tea, and with less hassle than the coffee. Perhaps the leaves offer their own filtration after they've expanded? In any case, makes a terrific cup of tea in about 2 minutes.",

    "text": "These things are OK.  I bought one and liked it enough for my application that I bought two more.<br /><br />I'm using them for engine exhaust outlets on electric generator enclosures.  They keep the weather and bugs out while not restricting exhaust flow.  When the gasoline engine exhaust has to push on a flap or damper to open it to let the exhaust flow out, that causes back pressure and encourages carbon monoxide build-up in the generator enclosure.  That's not a problem with these because they do not restrict the exhaust flow at all.<br /><br />A four inch flexible pipe and this work great to channel engine exhaust out and away from the generator shelter.  I use three &#34;L' brackets with niobium magnets fastened to the semi-flexible aluminum pipe to secure the exhaust line to the muffler on the generator.  This allows easy detachment to remove the generator from the enclosure for servicing.  A line of Loctite red RTV high temperature adhesive sealant around the opening of the pipe that rests on the muffler makes a decent gasket/seal.  All this works quite well as long as there's no restriction causing back pressure to force exhaust gasses out of the pipe where it joins the muffler.  So these are a really good solution for that application.<br /><br />They're also competitively priced compared to metal dryer vents.<br /><br />Another plus is that they don't have the protruding ducting tube that dryer vents do, which makes for an easier, more compact installation in these generator enclosures.  Simply insert the semi-flexible pipe into this fitting and seal it with aluminum foil ducting tape.  Don't use regular duct tape, use aluminum foil tape.<br /><br />I think they look great.  They look more professional for this kind of thing than a metal dryer vent.  I mount them so that they're directed down and at a 45 degree angle away from the building the shelter sits near.  That keeps the weather out and directs exhaust and noise down and away from the building.  Paper wasps will nest inside this, they can't get past the screen so they build on the outside of the louvers and screen because it is a compact, sheltered area -- Exactly the kind of thing they like.  What they don't like is getting gassed and cooked when the generator starts ...<br /><br />These things are stamped and formed metal.  Like ALL such things they have very sharp edges from the manufacturing process.  That's not a manufacturing defect or a quality control issue.  If you cut yourself on this that's YOUR  FAULT for not handling them properly.  I haven't gotten so much as a nick from these, or any other stamped, formed or cut sheet metal, for a very long time.  Show some good sense and you'll be fine.  If you cannot handle an object like this or any other sharp object without seriously injuring yourself then DIY and handyman projects are not for you.  If that's the case go hire someone who won't lose a finger on a simple piece of hardware.",

Add 2 level or slightly rounded tablespoons of coffee per cup. A cup is 200 ml, or about 7.5 fluid ounces. (Adjust coffee-water accordingly if your cup is really a giant mug.) Bring the correct amount of water to a boil, then set it aside about 90 seconds to cool slightly. Add just enough water to wet the coffee. Wait a few seconds, then add all the water and give it one stir.<br /><br />This makes a fairly strong cup. If you want a milder coffee, add a little water afterwards.

I strongly suggest you try putting your old rack back in a few times (if you still have back pins lol) to see how that works. (Yes there are locking tabs to remove it, you'll figure all this out.) Then I would take just these 2 new side T parts and try slipping them in and out - without the rack attached - and see how that works. Just as easy? (I did not know to do this...)<br /><br />Because attached to the rack (the replacement of parts is simple, as described in the video), trying to get the rack back in the track was a b.... And I think there may either be a slight excess on material on the pin flares, or something was not quite perpendicular and square (could have been my assembly but I don't think so.) Anyway, after multiple attempts (first one side would sort of cooperate but not the other, then vice versa, and sliding the rear pins back was Not easy) I finally got both rear pins to do what they needed, front pins dropped in and job completed.<br /><br />I would hope this job is not needed for at least another 5yrs like the OEM parts.",

The first impression is of a quality item.  The steel seems a bit more hefty than my typical foaming pitcher, and while it looks small in the photos, it's the right size for foaming for one or two drinks.  The sleeve is also cushy and comfy, and does protect extremely well from the heat.<br /><br />There are no volume measurements stamped into it, as there are with the typical 12-oz (which is about the size of this one - the box says 450ml) cheap stainless milk frothing pitcher costing a a bit less than half as much.  Volume measurements can help quite a bit for correct milk drink preparation.  Those less expensive units also have a welded handle, although the silicon sleeve does look much nicer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the silicon sleeve is partially glued on but wasn't evenly placed - the distance to the bottom varies as you go around.  And, as you can see in the photo with the demitasse and coffee cup, the rubber at the top is separating and the unit is fresh out of the box - never even washed.  I worry that water and crud might get caught in there, but since the sleeve isn't removable, it won't be cleanable.",

    "text": "I bought these to replace the K&J filters also bought here eons ago, to replace the OEM Maytag filters.<br />All three brands fit, none seem to leak.  This time, I chose Waterdrop because they're actually known for water filters, while K&J isn't.  (Although at least they tell us K & J stand for \"Karl and Josh! ;) )<br /><br />It's too early to discern long-term taste, but right off the top...<br /><br />1. The K&J filter helpfully has, on the base, an embossed arrow and text telling you which way to twist.  That's nice.  Waterdrop doesn't but really should.<br />2. The Waterdrop box came open.  All  the filters are double-sealed, so it wasn't a problem, but they should improve their packaging.<br />3. The Waterdrop filter comes with date-stickers.  The others don't.  But... I've always just written the date with black Sharpie on the base of the filter.  So while it's nice, it's not important.<br />4. Waterdrop's instructions include \"turn off the cold water to your fridge\".  As if.  Nobody else, not even Maytag, suggests that.  I didn't do it, and all was fine.<br />5. Both K&J and Waterdrop have websites, but all five refrigerator filter models that K&J makes show \"sold out\" on their website.  Waterdrop has the filters available for order from their website.  I have more faith in a company with a solid web site that actually has their own product.<br />6. All three products (Maytag, Waterdrop, K&J) are physically different; different water holes, different base bottoms, etc.  So this isn't a case, so common on Amazon, of a single Chinese manufacturer selling the same thing to everyone under the sun for rebranding.  But the Maytag filter was printed on, while the K&J and Waterdrop both have applied stickers, which suggests either rebranding opportunities or that they have a cheap-looking localization approach.<br />7. K&J is rated for 0.79 gpm, while Waterdrop and I believe Maytag are both 0.5 gpm.<br /><br />Some listing differences:<br /><br />K&J claims \"ultra-fine\" ground carbon; Waterdrop talks about their Sri Lankan Coconut-sourced carbon.<br />K&J quotes 99.99% of chlorine and sediment per NSF 42.  Waterdrop quotes 97% Chlorine, 97% Taste & Odor per NSF 42.<br />So numerically, K&J is significantly better, but that hasn't translated to a higher rating per Amazon reviews.<br /><br />Neither company mentions NSF 53 on their Amazon listing.  K&J doesn't mention it on their site either, but Waterdrop states on their website, \"Tested by NSF 53 to reduce 99.6% of lead, 99.99% of cysts, 96.6% of benzene, 98.4% of carbofuran, and 96.6% of endrin.\"  That's pretty important.  I would expect any decent filter to do well at these also, but K&J didn't even bother testing.<br /><br />NSF 42 is for aesthetic or \"non-health related\" contaminants - i.e. things that make the water look or taste bad but don't make it bad for you.  Neither one mentions NSF 53, which covers the health-impacting issues.  For comparison, a Brita filter is generally 97% NSF 42 also.  HOWEVER, I don't put much stock in the K&J 99.99% number; the NSF certificate listing doesn't show the percentage claimed; only that they were certified.",

I chose this little washer, and it has been one of the best purchases I have made for the RV. Our RV has a small corner shower which neither one of us likes to use so I turned it into the \"laundry room\".  I put this washer in the shower and use the shower head to fill the machine up.  This Zeny washer does a great job for what it is.  I only need a tablespoon of detergent per load, and all the clothes come clean beautifully. I can only put a half a load of clothes in the spinner at a time, but in about 2-3 minutes most of the water has spun out and the clothes are ready to hang to dry.  I do make certain to use pretreatment on stains and ground in dirt.  Also, there is nothing automatic about this machine -- definitely a complete hands-on appliance.<br />I gave this Zeny unit 4 stars because I would like to see a drain for the spinner and a separate drain the the washing half of the machine. Currently the washing side and the spinner side share the same drain.  I cannot have the drain open while washing the clothes because my wash water will drain out.  Yet, if I want to use the spinner while washing clothes I must have the drain open so the water can spin out.  In other words, I would like to wash and spin at the same time. (Sounds like some wierd dance! LOL)  This machine is too small to do king and queen sized blankets and quilts.  To wash bed linens means a trip to a laundromat, but that is ok. Also, I would not wash rugs or at least not heavy rugs in it either.  Overrall, I am happy with the Zeny washing machine and would purchase it again.<br /><br />Update:  I still really like this little machine.  For me, the key to getting along with it is not to over fill the washing half nor the spinning half.  The weight of a big load of water soaked clothes may be too much for the machine's motors.  I constantly remind myself that this is not a standard automatic washer.  It also helps to put it in the tub or shower when using it.  The fill tube that comes with the machine sucks big-time but is a common flaw with any of these types of machines.  I have heard that there is something called a Rinseroo  tube thing that attaches to the showerhead and provides a hose type thing that can be used to fill the machine.  Actually, it is usually used to wash the dog in the shower. It is not cheap, but it does look helpful.  It can be purchased here on Amazon.  If you have a detachable showerhead, you are in good shape.  I hope this helps someone(s) out there.",

It dumps a load of  ice about every 7 minutes.  After several loads we dump the ice in a ziplock and store in the fridge's freezer.  This portable ice maker will not keep ice frozen.  It would have to be a much larger unit and would not be portable if it could do that.  This ice maker has been one of the best purchases for our RVs, and has become invaluable during hot, humid southwest summers.  We and our son are extremely happy with this purchase.",

Another tip, I mix heavy cream and Italian Sweet Cream - 50-50 to taste - and heat it in the microwave (in a microwaveable cup) for 30 seconds and then froth it.  Using the K-Cup, I run the machine and then 'mix' it again with the frother.  If you use the karaf mixing the coffee the second time isn't necessary.  Enjoy !",

The repairman told me that was not possible, because there was a built in sensor that would tell me if there wasn't enough water. I asked, &#34;What do you have that tells me the sensor is broken?&#34; I had already done a test with an upright cup in the top rack to prove there wasn't enough water even to fill that cup.<br />That repairman replaced the sensor, and at least I was getting water then, but there still were filmy dishes and food specks. I took apart the bottom of the dishwasher and cleaned the gunk out of it that had collected but that was only minimally better. I'm taking it apart and cleaning out the gunk again tonight, because it's making a godawful grinding sound and everything I could find on the Net said that means something is clogged.<br />Even at the best of times, the machine takes forever to run: about 2 hours on Normal, and the Heavy setting is closer to 4 hours. It's quiet (except now, with the grinding) but I'd be quiet too if I wasn't doing anything.<br />This was a complete waste of money, and a terrible frustration. I read reviews before I bought it, thinking this would be a good machine, but out of all of the bottom line apartment dishwashers I used before I owned a home, this ranks far worse.<br />Also, the other reviewers aren't kidding about how easy it is to brush against it and turn the machine on. I had read that before I bought it and thought that was silly, but I should have listened ... it really is annoying.",

Just be careful not to overload or it isn't able to rinse well and don't over pour the soap.  You will be amazed at how fast clothes dry.  This washer spins for quite awhile but when I hang the clothes to dry on a hanger in the house, it only takes an hour or so to dry.  We wanted our laundry on the main floor but didn't want to spend the money on the plumbing.  This is a good solution.  Would work well in camper, dorm or apartment.  I put it on sliders as the castors just don't move it well on carpet.  There are dollys that are available too.  If using in multiunit living space, keep in mind the sound.  It's loud and vibrates.  The alarm is also very loud and would be nice if it could be shut off.",

Then the water started tasting like aquarium water and I learned you have a filter to change. And also theyre $35 each from the maker. AND you cant run it with out a filter. Suddenly I felt like a duped renter.  After researching I found these filters which were the best deal, being a 3-pack, which makes me suspicious as always but im very happy with them and they work perfectly.  The only problem I had was they didnt seem to fit in spite of them matching the model's number.  It warns on the fridge and filter directions NOT to push of force the filter \"up\" into the opening in fridge but rather just insert, turn and that motion will bring the filter upwards into the chamber and click.  I did this multiple times and it'd seem to \"place\" but no water would come out.  I put the old one in- water came out. Tried again, read again and was literally on the comp at amazon, ready to ask for a refund, when I thought heck,  i'll give it a bit of a shove with some purpose  and see if it clicks and tightens.<br /><br />  This did the trick. So, just a tip - if the filter gently threads into your water Thingie, great.  If its making contact but not catching or locking, dont hesitate to give it some pressure.  . I did a little Happy Dance and tge water flow is even stronger than the original company filter.<br /><br />these are great.  this is my 6th order since they're expensive as heck in stores and can't be beat here",

The water moves through the coffee and paper quickly and easily.<br /><br />I like REALLY STRONG coffee so the best part is that these filters are taller and I can use them in my Ekobrew Stainless Steel basket (which I love because it will hold more grounds than most of the plastic baskets). My problem with the Simple Cup was that the filter was not tall enough to accommodate the Ecobrew and was always getting pushed down into the basket making it a real messy job to dump the grounds and filter.  Not so with this brand.  Not only is the paper a better quality than Simple Cup, but these filters are taller and just enough of the filter is exposed at the top to be able to get a hold of it and pull the filer and grounds out easily.<br /><br />I highly recommend these filters.",

I did follow these directions, unfortunately none of the functions work. I plugged the unit in after 26 hours exactly and let it run for 5 hours before attempting to retrieve cold water. The cold water LED flashes when it is in the cooling process and is supposed to turn solid when the cold water is ready. The flashing never stopped. Same with the ice maker, it just filled with water, no ice at all formed. The reason I gave 4 stars and not 1 is simply because customer service was fast to answer my inquiry and they made it right. They refunded me the full amount as well as told me to keep the unit. Unfortunately it won't serve a purpose for me so I most likely will be donating it to goodwill as it still functions as a basic water dispenser. Some on here have said the customer service is bad and or non existing but that is not true at all. I first contacted Amazon, Amazon sent me a link to message the 3rd party company through the warranty tab and from there I explained my situation to the soopyk who got back to me in about 6 hours and issued my refund within 24 hours of communication back and forth. They didn't make it difficult at all. For the sole reason of customer service they get 4 stars.",

PROS: smooth and nothing to catch clothes especially knits. It is pretty sturdy and you can choose to use the whole length or use a smaller portion of the handle to make a shorter wash wand maybe if you're washing in a sink. You can unscrew the parts it packs away in a pretty small box, but even not taken apart it isn't huge so still a space saver. CONS: I thought around $20 and up here on Amazon was pricey for essentially a piece of plastic. You need some room in your wash tub to move clothes around effectively and play washing machine so I had to my wash in different \"loads\". As of course no way to spin dry clothes enjoy squeezing everything out for dying.",

There is a nice chart that makes perfect sense.<br />I think I figured out how to calibrate the Room Humidity setting by accident. The reading was way too high and I tried the adjustment setting to calibrate it with no success. I went to the setting number for calibration, unplugged the sensor from the unit, then plugged it back in, after that, it gave the correct room humidity???

My little one is 2 and it works fine with her. I love that there is an actual seat instead of the bag touching her skin as some other travel potty designs, seems way more comfortable. I like that the legs cold and slide closed to make a compact little item to store nicely in the back of my car, but it's also super easy to quickly open when needed. Both sides are also storage compartments, keep extra bags, a little pack of wipes and an extra pair or two of undies just in case. I wouldn't say this is something that you could tote around daily, about the size and weight of a smaller sized breif case. But again works great to keep in the car, camping, or even traveling to toss in a carry on bag(but I have a smaller more compact seat for that reason). I truly would recommend this!",

This was getting costly since I'm having to use the Polar system 24/7. So I ordered this ice maker in order to make my own ice and put it in the Polar System. It works perfectly! This ice maker makes ice really fast and the ice is very solid and lasts a good time in the Polar System. The store bought ice melted really quick and I was having to add ice every 2-3 hours. With this ice maker, I only have to add more ice about every 4-5 hours . The unit holds around 4lbs of ice. This ice maker has no trouble keeping up with the amount of ice I need. The only thing I don't like is that the unit is pretty loud. Other than that, I love this ice maker.",

I tried the scissors on fabric and on paper and it is remarkably sharp and works smoothly. It is definitely one of the sharpest pair of scissors i have owned. The great thing about it is that it works fine for both right and left handers and the grip is designed to be comfortable and strong.

Dryer gets warm, not hot, which I prefer to minimze shrinkage.<br />Some negatives; dryer is loud and lint filter is awkward to access. Also the plastic exhaust pipes are flimsy and loose fitting.<br />Overall I'm happy with this purchase so far.

No HE, front loader or digital fancy machine for me I wanted the same machine. Couldn't believe the same washer was still being built, it is this Speed Queen. Was thrilled to get it and have had it several months and it is still the best. It even matches the the original dryer that is still going strong. I think this is the best washer available and the appliance store that I use says it is their best selling machine , hands down.,",

Wasn't terribly complicated but added more time to install. Eventually, got the new plug installed and the item worked perfectly right away.",
