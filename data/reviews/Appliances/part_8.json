My tap water is 43.Now after a few more gallons of water going through it the TDS meter is showing 33. I expect it will go down even more as more water passes through it. So maybe this is good or maybe it is bad because you just don't know what is being filter out. But if you are eating a balanced diet you do not need stuff in your water except the water itself. Some purchased waters advertise 0 TDS. That is where I got my meter. So bottom line, it filters very well. You cannot go wrong buying this filter. Last comment.

I know the charcoal is a very good filter, because I have a fish tank and that is what they use to clean the water, but who knows.  This appears to me to be an item that you have to a little research on to see if are getting what you pay for. When I get some time I will post to show the results for my research on this product.

I shopped new knobs and found ones that fit my stove top but they were $32.00  each. $32.00 times 4 no sorry too expensive for me. I looked at the many different knobs Amazon offered and decided on these but not really thinking they would fit. They fit yes. They work yes. They are cheap looking yes. But we can all see the setting now. If you have  a newer burner top and want the original knobs and are willing to pay the price and can afford the cost that is what I would buy. If you have an older model and do mind not having the best buy these. They are cheap looking yes. But they work and you can see what the burner is set on. I do not think these knobs will last very long but my stove top is 19 years old. If someone offers a downdraft burner with induction I will buy a new one. But for now these knobs offer a dynamic improvement over my old ones. For the price I think I spent my money well. This is a purchase worth making if your knobs are old and worn old..",

This would have been a while lot worse without it. This was not an easy fix. You essentially have to take the whole washing machine apart so have room to lay it on its back. Have a standard socket set, both types of screwdriver, a hammer and a rubber mallet, small bock of wood, and I used 2 large vice grips though a set of channel locks would do for 1. I also had a bunch of towels because water comes out of everywhere as you go along. Oh, and its greasy and wet and there is some nasty stuff that builds up in the nooks and crannies of an old washing machine.you may as well have cleaning supplies to clean the thing while you have it apart. I found a great video online with some very easy and complete instruction. Just did the job today and the test load went well. No leaking and no jet aircraft sound. Don't say you weren't warned. 👍<br /><br />UPDATE: lowered over all score. Bearing are already making noise. Will end up getting good bearings and redoing the job. Other parts are fine hust the bearings are poor quality.<br /><br />FINAL UPDATE: reduced score to 1 star. Bearing is leaking again. Avoid this kit.",

I was stunned and SO EXCITED! I didn't know such a thing existed. When I saw that they all had good reviews, I was even more excited and knew I had to have one. I agonized over which one to get, but something kept drawing me back to this one. I'm glad I chose it because it has been wonderful! I can cook again without hand washing piles of dishes!<br />This little powerhouse cleans better than any previous full size dishwashers of mine ever have (except maybe my very first one). I'm stunned and delighted!<br />The ONLY complaint I have is that it is very difficult to get more than a few things in at a time, but what can you expect from a countertop model? Oh well, I'll just wash in multiple loads and keep smiling! At least I'm not standing at the sink wasting my time doing them by hand.<br />I highly recommend!<br />Let me add that I'm a single female who has never attempted to put together anything like this, but it was no problem!<br />Easy peasy!",

My procrastination finally worked in my favor for a change. I didn't change the filter on time yet my refrigerator still produces quality water and ice. I thought if I didn't change it on time it would let me get either. WRONG! I will canceling my subscription to receive this every 6 months and extend it to every 8 or so. Leaving me to only have to purchase this once a year. GE should be ashamed of themselves. You can find 3+ filters in a pack for the price of the one that they are selling us. The price and the fact that it expels black water after it has been replaced and you have to run TWO GALLONS( per instructions) of water just to filter it out. I included a picture of what comes out when it has been replaced.",

So, no problem.<br /><br />A GE washer purchased from Home Depot.  HD tried to insist we had to buy hoses from them.  They don't sell 10 feet hoses and these are much cheaper and appear better quality than the shorter hoses at HD. I told them to take the washer back if they could not install with these hoses.  They installed and I am happy.<br /><br />I am happy to find longer hoses, better quality, and cheaper from Amazon!",

Outside vent clogged from many years of poor venting system built into my condo, and didn't want to tear the walls apart for another, so I thought I would try indoor venting, since we could use the extra heat in the winter.  I saw this one by accident, and read the other reviews, and thought I would give it a try.  Well, it does work very well, indeed.  I did not want to attach it to the wall, so it sits next to the dryer on the floor. Just some information about the unit: It keeps the lint down not only with the fine gauge screen, but you also have to keep an inch of water in the little drawer that is in the front, at the bottom.  The lint trap can be taken completely off the front for cleaning, you just push down on a little tab on the top edge, and it pops out.  Since I have keep mine on the floor, and the unit is lightweight, you do need to add some weight inside the drawer to balance the weight of the vent hose that goes on the top..it will not tip over, but it will be a bit \"tippy\".  I had a small marble lamp base that I wasn't using, so I popped that in the drawer, and it keeps it stable.  You will have to empty the water/lint from the drawer from time to time so I wouldn't recommend using anything loose in the drawer for weighting, as that would get old real fast.",

After looking for leaks I learned that water level is not supposed to come above the door so don't spend too much time thinking its simply a seal issue.  After searching for the solution, realized that this valve is a common culprit when your dishwasher overflows.  Installation was easy but cramped (all the parts are under the door near the floor). but accessible.  Hardest part was unscrewing the OLD 90 degree elbow off the old valve.  If I had to do it again I would just get a new 90 degree elbow as it took 20 minutes and there are no good leverage points.  Once I had everything teflon taped up again, installation is easy: screw in the supply line, replace the discharge hose and crimp, connect the plug to the solenoid, then single screw to hold it all in place.  Has worked perfectly since, no leaks.",

I didn't like the suggested method (silicone only) so it added a day to the process to do it more securely. I also had to cut a hole in the wall because the genius installers left the box exposed for the wiring, but there was no way to get to the clamp. Patching that is another project in my future.<br /><br />The reason I like this unit was 1) It was crazy cheap 2) It had a low powered and high powered element in the front, which fits my cooking style. \"Quick Boil\" is 3000 watts; I do my boiling in an instant pot, but the extra power is useful when stir frying or searing steaks. Even the smaller inside element is 1600 watts. My previous cooktop had 2 1200 in the front and a 2500 and 2000 watt in the rear. You can't stir fry on the rear element easily.<br /><br />I feel like this unit is a bit more \"glassy\" than my previous unit; a bit more fragile. Time will tell how it holds up.<br /><br />A downside is that I have to re-learn how to cook my favorite dishes, as the settings and power is very different. The Quick Boil element will burn fried potatoes on 3 in a couple of minutes. On the bright side is that the wok heats up in half the time.",

I think it could be greatly improved if it were double the length and went from front-to-back of the refrigerator (the full length).  As it is now, it is much shorter than I was expecting and we end up piling items in front of it and it makes it harder to grab eggs out.  Other than the length issue, I like the product ... I just wished it helped with organization more.  If we didn't have to stack them on top of each other, and it was the full depth of the refrigerator, it would help us organize better because we could then put items on top of the egg container and it would look better and function MUCH better.  As it is now, I would not recommend for people who needs storage for 5 dozen eggs (as we do).",

However, I WAS able to correct it by bending the slats so they were all even and the sides of them were holding them just right.  Now, they are MUCH quieter and work exactly as I'd expect.  If you are having troubles, try taking a good look at it and adjust the sides (where each slat goes in to the main part).  You'll know what I mean, when you see the issue.  Then, just easily correct it by bending it SLIGHTLY, as needed.",

I love that they help me clean up my refrigerator and let in a bit more extra light - just a note:  it would be even lighter if I pushed them all the way back.  In my before and after photos, I have them pulled far up front to show that they give extra light, even though they are blocking it more.  I recommend placing the eggs in the cartons with the small side down as this will help you to remove them much easier.  I read some reviews that said there were holes in the bottom - None of my three egg holders had those.  They did have a place that looked like it was part of the typical production process but these are all fully closed - none of them are bent or affecting the ability to set straight on a shelf.  So, I'm guessing if others are having issues, perhaps they received counterfeits ?  In any case, I'm very happy I purchased these because three of these hold more than the five dozen box - which means I can buy eggs when I have a few left, yet!  I Highly Recommend these!",

This one, the DV331AEW, has \"steam technology,\" which is really just a water connection that allows a fine mist spray into the hot dryer.  Having tried it, I must say it really works.  I have plain cotton shirts that wrinkle a lot, and have always needed thorough ironing after being thru a dryer.  Using the \"Refresh\" cycle, 15 minutes with a small water (steam) spray, all I had to do was touch-up iron the collars & pockets.  In addition, there is a 90 minute \"wrinkle prevent\" option that tumbles clothes every few minutes and keeps lots of wrinkles from setting in.  Installation is easy, but still a few comments.  The dryer specification says it is 38.6 inches tall.  (We bought the one without the booster drawer underneath.) Really, with its plastic feet, it is 40 inches.  No big deal?  It was for me, as we had already built a counter that had exactly 38.65 inches clear, so I removed the big plastic feet and put a square of 1/4 inch plywood under each corner.  Samsung furnishes water hoses and a wye fitting to get cold water from the washing machine faucet.  It would have worked OK, but to reduce the clutter, I ran an extra water faucet from the crawl space and up behind the dryer.  The dryer's lint filter is well-designed and has all rounded corners to avoid catching clothes, which had been a real problem with our old dryer.  It also has a door over its lower half, which avoids spilling lint while removing to empty it.  By the way, as many people have already learned, some shopping around gets better prices: the vendor I bought dryer from was asking $859.00",

It is heavy and has terrible feet that will damage linoleum floors.<br /><br />After 6 years of modest use, the cheap plastic hinges on this $600.00 cooler cracked and broke.  After contacting Edgestar for parts, they emailed me back  a link to order them - $38.69 for two cheap plastic hinges! The order date was 4/2/2019.<br /><br />Just got a followup - shipping is slated for OCTOBER 4th, OR SIX MONTHS OUT.  In the meantime, I have a $600 cooler that doesn't work because the cheap plastic hinges are broken and the company is so incompetent, they can't supply parts.<br /><br />Bottom line - BUY ANOTHER BRAND",

MUCH better than having to turn off the freezer and sit there with the door open passing a hair dryer over the inside of the door, or having to blow warm air up the water line at the junction under the appliance.

None of the companies making these things seem to take in account that the water actually needs to be in contact with the coffee for some period of time to make a decent cup of coffee. If you take a look at a used k-cup, you'll see that there is a small hole in the top where the water goes in and a small hole in the bottom where the coffee comes out. Most of these filter units have large screened opening that don't allow any pressure to build up like a real k-cup does. So you end up with a very weak cup of coffee even if you over pack the filter.<br /><br />But the design of this Keuring My K-Cup filter is different, it actually takes the place of the whole coffee unit. You can actually get a drinkable cup of coffee from it, even without using a ton of grounds. The one thing I still don't like is having to clean out the basket after every cup. So I've been using these - [[ASIN:B00BUFGMDI Disposable Filters for Use in Keurig® Brewers - Simple Cups - 50 Replacement Filters - Use Your Own Coffee in K-cups]]. They make the chore a bit more palpable.<br /><br />I might note that I'm using this filter with a Mr. Coffee brand k-cup machine and had no problems installing it. Something else that might be of interest. I purchased the filter I'm using at the local big-box store and paid nearly twice what they want for one here (doh!).",

As some has said, it's not an exact replacement only because it doesn't include the connector.  For that, it seems companies want about an extra $160, which is just outright theft.  This came, instead, with two ceramic wire nuts, which you splice onto the factory connector.  Very easy.  The hardest part was removing and replacing the two screws holding the ignitor in place, which is tricky on my oven.  This being my first time working on an oven, it took me about an hour to disassemble and reassemble everything.  The oven fired right up afterwards.  Less than $19 spent for what would have been a $400 repair job.",

We were a bit surprised that our ‘replacement unit' was a refurbished machine. It lasted about a month before it quit….now I just received Opal Nugget machine #3 and when I opened this replacement, I found mold inside the box (all over the inside top and bottom) and the machine is dented…I have asked for a refund and am only “blessed” with replacement units. Terrible customer service. The mold inside the box just takes the cake…a nice added feature they sent us straight from China.<br />I would not advise anyone to buy this unit.",

It is the same as the original. Less than 5 minutes we were already working with the new one. We made some batches of water to the sink, but after that the water was perfect. No flavor at all. And the best part is that it comes in 3 pack! So you already have the replacement ready. Love how simple and easy this is. :)",

We had an issue right after getting this and I was grateful to have it around. That said, it's better for smaller loads of laundry. We couldn't get a large load of laundry to completely fit in it. If you have lots of clothes to dry, this will take up a large chunk of time trying to get it all done. It's better than nothing, but I do think it's best for lighter needs or just for the more delicate or awkward in the dryer types of items.",

I love being able to skip walking up and down 3 flights of stairs with my laundry visiting the shared apartment laundry room and skipping the shared machines.<br /><br />This little machine can handle all of my laundry needs for a family of 2 adults. I have this machine on the counter next to my kitchen sink most of the time, but it is not heavy when empty and I can take if off my counter whenever I need more counter space. I pair it with a spin drier and a wooden drying rack. Every morning I wash some laundry and put away the previous days clean laundry.<br /><br />I have found that it's important to make size appropriate loads. If you're washing towels you will need to make a smaller load than light weight t-shirts. Don't put too many items in at one time, start small. This unit is smaller than others, so if this concerns you I would look for a bigger model.",

I like this unit a lot and I use it daily during Pandemic Lockdown to avoid my apartment laundry room. Some things are better, some are worse, than my previous unit.<br /><br />The spinning of this unit is much more stable than my previous unit, when loading a spin drier you must make sure the load is balanced or it won't work and this one takes very little effort to get right almost every time. It works very fast, my typical spin time is 3 minutes. It extracts a lot of water very quickly. If you've never used a spin drier for hand-washing clothes before, you will be surprised how much this small machine can do!<br /><br />This unit is smaller than the previous one I had, which I have mixed feelings about. On the plus side, it is very compact and can fit underneath my kitchen cabinets easily. On the other hand, it can't handle larger items. In terms of largest items this spin drier could handle, 1 pair of jeans completely fills the spin barrel. Smaller items like shirts, sweaters, shorts, kitchen towels all fit very easily. It cannot spindry bedsheets are full size towels.<br /><br />Overall,  if you like to do your laundry \"by hand\" but with some assistance this machine is perfect for you!",

    "text": "I waited over a year to write this review. For the first 8 months, the Panda was great. Suddenly after owning the machine for 8 months (Nov. 2020), the unit overflowed and flooded my apartment. I contacted the manufacturer. The manufacturer replied immediately:<br /><br />\"Thank you for emailing us. We are sincerely sorry to hear that there is something wrong with your machine. Please do not worry, your machine has a one year manufacturer warranty, and we will help you with further service.\"<br /><br />The manufacturer knew exactly what the problem was - the vibration of the machine caused the intake hose to dislodge from the machine which caused the machine to flood.<br /><br />Despite a number of suggested \"fixes\" - which included me having to purchase waterproof silicon sealant,  none of the fixes lasted more than a few weeks.<br /><br />My most recent contact with the manufacturer (April 2021) noted the following:<br /><br />\"Thank you for emailing us. Unfortunately, the 1 year warranty of your machine has expired, so we are not able to help you with further warranty service.\"<br /><br />I purchased the Panda in Feb. 2020 - I reported the flooding problem in Nov. 2020 - the flooding has persisted despite the manufacturer's help for 5 months. Now the machine is no longer under warranty.<br /><br />Since they refuse to fix or replace the unit - Each Time I Use the Panda - I have to lift it up and put it in the bath tub - when the unit does flood, I have to pick the Panda up - which is full of water and turn it upside  down to fully drain it.<br /><br />I'm 67 and have a heart condition. This is not a safe option for me. Unfortunately, I live on a limited income and replacing the unit is not within my current means.<br /><br />Let me be clear - there is nothing mechanically wrong with the Panda. The vibration of the machine causes the intake hose to dislodge from the unit. This should have been a simple fix. The fact that the manufacturer immediately knew what caused the flooding indicates that this is not an isolated event.<br /><br />Buyer Be Ware!",

I went for a chemex to get away from the sludge of a French press and still wanted the essential oils to be in my coffee so I tried this filter out. After using this I experienced my best cup of coffee in my life. Full flavor and full bodied cup. Filter didn't clog at all and made 40oz of coffee in under 5 min with this filter. Highly recommend as opposed to paper filters.<br /><br />Update after 1 month of daily use:<br /><br />Coffee takes around 15 minutes to run water through this filter. I always clean after brewing and have soaked and washed multiple times and still filter barely lets out water. Coffee is now bitter as it's being over extracted. Guess back to paper filters until a decent filter is made.",

Place the aroepress on a sturdy mug and pour hot water over the grounds. Now bear in mind for an 8oz drink, all is needed is 1 tablesoon of ground coffee and water poured to the 1-1 1/2 mark. Doesn't sound like much. It didn't sound like much to me. However we are not making drip coffee but espresso. A little goes a long way. Now, slowly press down on the plunger till it presses against the grounds. The idea is to fill the rest of your cup with either hot milk, cream, or water depending on what drink you are making. The manual that is provided in the box was very helpful with detailed instructions on how to make the common drinks.<br /><br />It should be shipped with a stirring stick, a scoop, a funnel, a stack of filters, and a carrying bag.

    "text": "I have a Bosch single, 27 inch wall oven, model HBN3450UC, installed in May of 2012. In short order, grease began to build up between the two glasses. One Bosch representative responded with \"not under warranty because the problem is cosmetic, not functional.\" If there is a seal protecting the glasses, it is not functional, and if there is no seal, that is poor design and manufacturing. I asked to have a superviser contact me but even after two follow up contacts with this person, no supervisor has responded. I mailed a letter to the address on the Bosch website given as the contact address; however, the letter has been \"\"returned to sender. I called my appliance dealer and was told that it will cost $300.00 to clean between the glasses. He mentioned that this problem occurs randomly. The oven is not a year old, there is no warranty on the problem, and Bosch appears to be unconcerned that I will have to spend a good amount of money to clean up their mistakes. I will not recommend that anyone install any Bosch product because this company does not seem to care about the quality of their products and particularly does not express concern over their customers' satisfaction. I have been trying to resolve this since late December, 2012. So far, this company stands firm on its claim that the problem is cosmetic and it is caused by \"condensation and grease build up during cooking.\" AVOID BOSCH.<br /><br />If you don't mind having an oven that appears filthy and unkempt after only a few months of light use, then a Bosch might be right up your alley. Additionally, if you enjoy a company that stands behind that kind of poor quality, then Bosch is the company for you.",

It wasn't until one night about 2 am I happened to hear water running inside the refrigerator. When I opened it water was pour from the filter. (Not dripping but actually pouring out). I removed the filter and it stopped. Unfortunately my ice maker won't work without a filter. I tried reinstalling it the next day and again it appeared to be working fine. But again within a few days the puddles were back. Luckily Amazon has a wonderful return policy and I was able to get a refund.<br /><br />Bottom line I would not try this filter for an older refrigerator.",

Takes more time, but you don't have to worry about it crashing down. 2.) &#34;Optional&#34; cut the plug off and use  a low profile plug.  YOU can get it at home depot as a short extension cord.  I did this because things were a little tight when I wired in the electrical in the wall. 3.) Installing the stack must begin at the top and you should use masking tape to keep it from telescoping back to the bottom.  Also - the screws they give you are about 1/4&#34; long and are a royal pain to get started... but if you use those longer electrical screws for outlets - you will find the threads are the same and much easier to get started.<br /><br />Great range hood!

So, all things equal, brewing with the standard disk leads to a cup a bit less extracted that brewing with the fine disk. It's fun to experiment with different grinding settings and see what I get with each disk.<br /><br />My only complain is that there were very minor cosmetic flaws on both disks.

    "text": "I have a 6 Cup Chemex coffee maker and dont get me wrong I love the thick luxurious paper Chemex filters but they are so wasteful.... they use far more paper then a typical pour over filter .....  I felt so indulgent and wasteful every time I made a pot of coffee and I knew I couldn't continue this way. Yes they brew a superior cup of Joe to standard paper filters but I knew there had to be a better solution!  So I started looking for a more sustainable option.  I tried the metal filters and HATED the taste of the coffee, so when I heard about the CoffeeSock I was really excited to give it a try. It comes with 2 filters. Each one should last you about 6 months depending how much coffee you make. Before the first use of these filters, you need to boil them for 10 minutes to shrink the fabric and get rid of any stray fibers/ impurities ....  Just a warning and something to know going in...  the first few pots you make using this filter will just be okay and not great.... but do not give up hope!  The fabric gets seasoned by the coffee oils and then and only then does it start making a good cup of coffee.<br /><br />The 2 pointy edges make a great sturdy handle to lift the filter up so that you can pour your coffee out.  It is easy to empty the grounds into the compost bin and I no longer have a stack of paper filters slowly decomposing in there! After emptying the the grounds,  rinse the filter and let it dry between uses. I have used the filter damp to make a second pot of coffee and it is totally fine. Do not wash them with soap as it will change the flavor of your brew... The coffee sock fabric will turn a rich coffee brown but they never seem dirty per se ....  about once a month or so it is a good idea to give your filter a \"deep clean\" by boiling it in a pot of water .....  You will know when it is time to change to a new sock when the filter starts to brew very slowly ...  this can also indicate a need for a deep clean.  Yes these take a little more time and effort then a paper filter but not much and the planet thanks you!",

Second cup I did inverted and it worked better but I made a mess with the grounds when I stirred. I'm using very fresh beans and when you add hot water they foam as they release gases. I've discovered that instead of stirring right off the bat, I have to kind of poke the plume of grounds to get them back into the water. After a handful of pokes, I can gently start stirring and then it all comes together. For my non-decaf beans there is a larger bloom and I have to add more water after I've got them mixed back in.<br /><br />After you use these, make sure you rinse them well and rub off the oils you see in the screen.

I use the plunger to stop up the aero while I have the water sit on the grounds (Stumptown Coffee Roasters technique) so when you unplug it it causes a back suction that can lift the paper. I use the metal filter over the paper. I have no problem with the cap screwing on as others had. Maybe it's been redesigned to work better. Anyway it works great. Since I hand grind my coffee it removes those occasions when time/effort would be lost. Using the Slimm filter makes cleanup a bit more fiddly (I save spent grounds for compost and worms) but not a big deal.<br />Should last a very long time plus I have a backup.",

I thought when I got it \"This has got to be overhyped, it's just a thick plastic-y thing!\" but it really is as good as people say. Looks are deceiving. It is wonderful to use, and dead simple. Put your filter in, put the grounds in, put the water in, stir it a bit, put the plunger on, and plunge. It makes excellent coffee, very full bodied, but still with good clarity due to the paper filter. Absolutely no sediment at the bottom of the cup either! Clean up is a breeze, just take the filter holder off, and pop the filter and most of the grounds out with the plunger, rinse, and it's clean. It's so simple and easy, absolutely zero fuss! I recommend this maker for anyone wanting for a quick and easy to clean maker, or for getting into manual coffee making. It requires very little skill, but it has alot you can do, so you'll never truly master it. I bought one, and recommended it highly enough that a friend of mine did too.",

Also, quite disclaimer about this review, I have bought 200 filters in the past by buying 2 100 packs individually at different times, I bought these as I was running low, but I have NOT brewed any with this set of 200. It feels the same, looks the same, and I am certain, will act the same. So, understand I'm really just reviewing the last 200, not the next. With that out of the way, let's get into the review.<br /><br />The Chemex and the filters with it are excellent tools to making good coffee. Will it make good coffee by itself? No, but it will certainly amplify a good coffee that you put in, ground in the right way with the right tools, and brewed with good technique. Is the coffee usually well bodied? Yes, but compared to a French Press with a metal filter, it isn't as thick or muddy of flavor (not a bad thing, just you don't get the underlying notes.). A Chemex makes a very well balanced cup, with alot of clarity, and it's all due to that filter. The filter is double bonded, and I won't lie, it looks like cheap napkin, but looks are deceiving.<br /><br />This type comes in squares, and when you open it to put it in the Chemex itself, one side is 3 ply, the other is 1. You put the 3 ply side on the side of the Chemex with the spout to prevent airlocking so your coffee brews correctly. The Squares are actually really nice, it gives you something to grab when you are ready to throw it away. I really appreciate that, and it looks great with it. Now, you may say that the filters are very expensive, sorta. You spend $0.10 every carafe you make in just filters, but the quality of that carafe of coffee is excellent, so I never regret using a filter just to make one single cup of coffee. I will say, the drawdown time of the coffee is a little long, but that's just how the Chemex brews, and I would not recommend adjusting grind setting to change that. The Chemex just takes a little longer than a V60, but I believe the results are better to me. Overall, I think it's a brilliant way to brew coffee, and I love being able to wake up to brew a wonderful Chemex full of coffee.",

    "text": "I never knew how massive a role a filter makes in the flavor of coffee. That paired with a proper grinder makes for a very radically better cup of coffee than what I was used to. The filter is really what makes the Chemex, a Chemex. It feels sturdy, and very dense in a way. Like craft paper. It restricts water flow much better than metal filters, and I have not seen much, if any, sediment in the bottom of any of my coffee cups. The coffee comes out very smooth, and has a more refined flavor than my other ways of making coffee. The square shape of the filters threw me for a loop, but they aren't hard to use, and the box does technically show you how to open it up and place it in the pour over. Technically. Once you get your hands on it, you'll see what I mean, it's not hard, just not instantly apparent. Squares versus circles? No clue, your choice. Also, there was no paper-y flavor for me, or chemical flavor, after properly wetting the paper a good bit and pouring the water out. I will say, 20$ USD for 100 filters or .20 cents per each is not cheap at all, or even at 10$, but is well worth it. Regardless if you have a genuine chemex or some over pour over that uses pretty similar cone filters, these filters are worth your money.",

On the other side, cleanup is a little more cumbersome. With paper filters, I can just pop off the bottom and push the paper filter with the grounds into the trash can. With the metal filter, grounds will stick to your filter and you will have to remove them by hand somehow and this is just slightly more time consuming than tossing everything in the trashcan.

    "text": "I'm a coffee-guy and I roast my own green beans.  I've tried nearly every variety of coffee method...siphon, press, Moka, true espresso, drip...and now the Aeropress...all have their merits...but...if at all possible I STAY AWAY FROM PAPER FILTERED METHODS.<br /><br />It is important to understand that 99% of U.S. citizens don't know any coffee flavor profile beyond awful year old pre-ground coffee (Folgers) or vacuum packed roasted coffee (whole bean or ground).  When they hit supermarket shelves...all varieties of coffee are \"dead\" coffee...meaning it's too far away from their original roasting and that hugely impacts coffee flavor.  Coffee drinkers have also been duped in that they mistake overly roasted beans (aka dark roast) for flavor when it's actually marketed by corporate coffee to cover up inferior beans.<br /><br />So, when I see ANY coffee reviews I always take them with a grain of salt...a \"clean cup\" typically means little coffee flavor which is what most want...even if they don't know it.  Let's be clear...ANY time you paper filter coffee you are removing flavor and changing its flavor...that's just the way it is because you are removing the natural coffee oils.  After all this time drinking coffee with their natural oils in the cup...I can taste paper brewed coffee which is usually insipid, McDs or Dunkin Donut style coffee in some form.<br /><br />Remember...that style is awesome if all you want is a shot of caffeine...go for it...but...don't mistake this style for flavorful coffee by any stretch of the imagination...it's night and day...and when you do go to the next level with coffee...beans from Ethiopia have a different flavor profile than from Kenya, Java, or Costa Rica...and so forth...there's a whole world of coffee out there that people are missing.<br /><br />With this in mind...I really like the FINE version of the filter with the Aeropress because (unlike paper) it allows the unique characteristics of the bean to come through...this disk is noticeably thinner...and oddly enough this filter is actually easier to press than the standard even with the finer holes.  It allows for the oils to come through and it allows for a finer grind (if that's what you prefer)...which has the potential for extracting more flavor from coffee.<br /><br />I will also say after many uses my FINE disk has remained in perfect form...no warping as has been mentioned.  One reason COULD be that it's always important with stainless (including pans) that you don't throw cold water on it if it's hot/really warm...it makes them warp.  I always use very, very warm water to clean...this includes hot water from my pot.<br /><br />Second, when I clean I've never had an issue with losing the filter...I'm unsure how that could happen...when you unscrew make sure the Aeropress is inverted...the filter will remain on the puck...take it off the puck..pop the puck...and then clean.<br /><br />Overall...I highly recommend the FINE version of the disks.",

They don't get clogged like the reusable metal filters do and are easy to clean out. Tip for emptying them into the trash/compost: rather than trying run to the trash and dump it out without dripping, just set the filter inside of your mug, fold down the edges to pull up the coffee grounds and spoon out the excess coffee. You can rinse the spoon in the sink while you rinse the remaining grounds off. I find it's an tidy drip free way to empty it out, rather than shaking coffee grounds all over the place.",

I have both products (wanted to see what the difference was).  I don't see any major (or minor) differences, so first, buy the cheaper one (my advice).  As to the product, they really are much heavier than the typical coffee filters you buy--even the \"better\" brands.  One thing though, these are kind of weird.  You get them, and they are folded in four sections.  You can use them on a regular coffee machine (cone type), but they are specifically designed for the glass chemex glass decanters.  What's strange is you are directed to unfold one portion (of the folded pieces) and put the other three sides toward the decanter pouring opening.  In essence you have three sides touching the glass on one side and one side touching the glass on the other side where is all fits into the cone (or rounded opening). So why have three sides to filter when the other side is just one layer thick? It's hard to explain, and other reviewers have tried; don't let that discourage you though, it really is a great product, and it (these heavy filters) is the main reason Chemex glass decanters produce such superior coffee (well, that plus the fact that you control the temperature of the water going through your coffee grounds).  Hope this helps. Update:  The difference between the FC-100 and the FS-100 is this one is a CONE and the other one is just a sheet of paper folded into quarters (a reqular sheet of paper folded twice).  The cone fits a little better into the Chemex in my opinion.  Prices fluctuate, so keep that in mind.",

Both are heavy duty white filters which produce the best possible cup of coffee using the Chemex system.  These would probably be extremely good for a regular coffee drip system, I haven't tried them (as I am TOTALLY ENAMORED by my new Chemex system) as yet on my new Cuisinart (which will probably just collect dust except in an emergency).  They appear somewhat larger than the \"regular cone filters you find for most drip coffee systems, so you would probably have to cut them down to size to make them fit with a pair of scissors (worth it?  yes, I think so as the filter works much better than regular filters).  Got to go have another cup of java using this system (this is right after my detailed, super reviews--my opinion-- of the chemex system). Update:  The difference between these (FC-100) and FS-100 is these are cone like structures, and the other ones are just a sheet of paper folded into four parts or quarters.  It's the same material,just the price is different and the way you put it into the chemex is slightly harder with the sheets.  (Did you know you can make your coffee even more mellow if you take egg shells, clean and dry them, and put them semi crushed in the bottom of your filter?  It may even increase your calcium intake.)",

The paper is heavier, thicker, more dense the \"normal\" paper filters.  One little thing, the directions are somewhat difficult to understand (or maybe I am just dense) in putting them into your cone.  When you pull the filter from the box, it is shaped in a cone like structure; however, there are four folds. I  know this sounds dumb, but the directions say to put the three sides of the folded paper against where you pour the liquid out and the other section covering the rest of the cone area.  If you think my directions are weird or incomprehensible, the directions on the box aren't much better See my main review on the chemex  system for a thorough discussion of the filter and the system.  These filters are not cheap, around 12 cents each (100 for 12 bucks); but they are far better than the other (even Melitta) filters on the market.  If you want good coffee, you gotta go the extra mile.  This is the extra mile.<br /> (One thing I don't quite understand is there is another chemex coffee  conical filter--looks the same to me in the picture--that sells on Amazon for only 9 dollars; I don't know the differences, if any between the two products; you might save a couple of bucks and get your cost down to 9 cents a filter.)",

    "text": "My 10+ year U-Line broke, bought this NewAir cooler because it was 30% off on sale.  Below are my observation so far:<br /><br />1. It's not a wine holder, six shelfs and holds a lot of cans.  Shelf has various heights, the top two hold regular size soda cans upright, the other four don't, specially the bottom shelf is very shallow good for glass beer or Mexican coke.  The shelfs are pretty flimsy, four out six arrived twisted, I blended them back to usable shape.  You can adjust position, but not going to gain capacity.  They do pull out for easy loading.<br />2. The lowest temp is 36 degree F and it struggles to hold at 36.  The insulation is thin so it moves between 41 and 36 often in this old season, 38 seems to be the happy spot.  Curious how hard it will work in summer?<br />3. It has a disco looking two steps blue light inside, but it's not door sensitive, so I can't figure out when I will ever turn it on?<br />4. It comes with hardware so you can change to door to open on left hand side.<br />5. The noise level is acceptable.  I can hear it, but not loud enough to bother me.  The cooler is open space kitchen bar area.<br />6. It was delivered double boxed.  With the exception of bended shelfs, there is no dent to the body.<br />7. The price I paid was about 1/3 of an U-Line.  I purchased a three years extended warranty, so, if it lasts five years, I'm happy.<br /><br />The bottom line is level your expectation and you get what you paid for.<br /><br />Cheers",

Sometimes if I overload it, it will take two hours and the clothes will still be damp. Small, frequent loads are highly recommended.<br /><br />I regularly fit 3 pairs of jeans, a couple shirts, a handful of socks and underclothes, and it seems to dry it quite nicely.",

This allows us to either make ice on demand or make a bunch and keep in the freezer (we tend to do both--make ice when needed and make extra for in between).  The ice it makes is the hollow tube type, which is good for making quick ice and quickly melts in your beverage.<br /><br />Setup took seconds, and it's easy to drain and keep ready for the next go round.  It's not too bulky, so you can keep it out on a counter or bar, but that does mean that the compact basket needs to be periodically emptied.  It lacks any form of plumbing, but the water receptacle is plenty big.  If anything I wish that the ice basket were larger to allow it to essentially fill around the same time as the water runs out.  The other quirk is that the ice comes out wet and just barely frozen.  If you put into a freezer, it will stick to other ice and make a block of ice.  As long as I break it up in an hour or so, it stays separated.  These quirks aside, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Highly recommended",

Some online research revealed that the igniter heats up by was of resistance and the flow of current then triggers the gas valve to open.  A complete, but poorly performing ingniter would display my symptoms, so I sought out the right part.<br /><br />When shopping on some appliance part website, my handy Amazon Google Chrome plug in displayed a message saying that Amazon had it, and sure enough they did (and at 40% of the price) and it was available with Prime shipping!  I never knew to look at Amazon.  The first igniter arrived on a sub zero day, well packed but was broke.  Having read other reviews I understood these to be highly brittle, and sure enough it was.  As noted it was very well packed, but the conditions were less than ideal.  A prompt replacement was dispatched, and it arrived intact.<br /><br />I skooted the oven out, unplugged the power (left the gas line connected), and removed the door and racks.  The metal guard that shrouds the ignited was held in place by three easy to remove sheet metal screws, and the I pulled the old igniter out.  At first glance, it seems much bigger than what's in my oven, but much get's hidden behind the back wall.  It's an identical part.  I fished the wire nuts out via the smallish hole to unscrew the old unit.  I replaced the plastic ones with new ceramic wire nuts (rate for high temps, but the old ones should work).  Note these were not included with the replacement part, but likely weren't needed. Then I put everything back into place.  The hardest part was removing the metal guard from the old igniter and installing on the new one, especially while being fearful of it's brittle nature.  All in all, it took 20 minutes, including putting the door back on (which can be tricky).<br /><br />Everything worked great, and the oven heats much faster than I've ever seen.  It must have been going bad these last few years.  I'm so glad I fixed this myself.",

Now I have a home for my cheap (but oddly good) Trader Joe's beer, Coke Zero, etc... I suppose a hipster could put some PBR in there as well.<br />In most regards, this is a wine fridge designed for cans, though as noted, it does get colder than many wine fridges.  I have mine set at the coldest setting, which does hit the &#34;high 30s&#34; claim at 38 degrees Fahrenheit.  It would be nice if it could get a bit colder, but it gets the job done.  It will take a while for a full fridge to cool, so you're better off loading it half way and then adding more cans rather than adding a bunch of warm cans at once.<br />As you'd expect, the door remains frost free, and it looks handsome.  Not overly high end, but nice enough.  This is a great complement to a home bar, billiards room, home theater, video game setup, etc...  The relatively quiet compressor doesn't distract too much, but it does have a compressor, and it's not overly quiet, so it's more suited for environments that can accommodate intermittent but generally quiet noise..<br /><br />Is this for you?

It follows that appearance by delivering with a simple control layout that sacrifices the ultimate in control by replacing permutations of multiple knob placements with one simple dial.  At first I was skeptical, but I've learned to love it.  No more forgetting to check all the knobs to make sure the right setting is selected!  Alas, there doesn't appear to be a way to turn on a ringer, but there is a wrinkle control feature to lend time to getting to your clothes.  Also, the dryer gets clothes dry really fast, so in a longer cycle, it can be dry well before the cycle ends.  Oh, the capacity is enormous.  I honestly don't believe what fits inside is housed in what's outside.  It's some sort of distortion of physics, and it's quite a blessing.  What's not so great?  The door is very hard to open (only had it a bit, so it may loosen up), the lint filter is up top (makes using the top of the dryer for storage more difficult, and it's built like a &lt;$400 dryer (no biggie, since it's priced accordingly).<br /><br />The delivery<br />I'm absolutely floored with how great the experience was.  I was contacted by JB Hunt, who scheduled a delivery day, and then followed up with a call the day before with a smaller time window.  The driver called ahead when en route, and arrived dead on the window and when he said he would.  He and his partner were clean, polite, courteous, and very careful.  They measured every door, carefully avoided hitting any walls or railings, and actually installed the dryer (not just delivery).  They also carefully hauled the old dryer away, and went about their way.<br /><br />Overall Pros:<br />cheap<br />quiet<br />huge capacity<br />simple operation<br />gets clothes dry<br />great delivery/install service<br /><br />Overall Cons:<br />basic<br />no frills build/design<br />simple operation (if you're looking for ultimate control)<br />no signal<br /><br />All in all, I couldn't be happier.

I have a tiny tiny apartment and a tiny bathroom, with only about a 15X15 inch space directly in front of the toilet.  So I bought the Panda and the Nina Spin Dryer to go with it.  The Panda fits *perfectly* on top of the Nina.  When its time for laundry, I simply place the Panda perfectly on top of the (lowered) toilet seat cover so it sits next to my shower.  That way I can fill it easily with a handheld shower head and drain it directly into the tub (its a gravity drain btw).  When laundry (and spin) is done, I just put the Panda back on top of the Nina to get it out of the way but not take up living or storage space.  I highly recommend this setup.  So easy.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars but I think my setup is ideal for it so it might not be as easy for other people.  Also, I was lucky it fit so well on top of the Nina and toilet, although I have a normal if not small toilet.  Also, you really have to have a spinner or some sort of dryer here, I can't imagine how long it would take to dry wet clothes.  If they could somehow build that in to this machine I'd give it 10 stars!",

    "text": "This is NOT an alternative for laundry machines.  I was hoping to use in my apartment but its a disappointment for that use.  I'd have given three stars but the description says \"ideal for apartment dwellers\" and its not.<br /><br />It fits about half of what I can get in a laundry machine, so it saves about $1 for me each load.  The design isn't great, it could be engineered much more compactly and sturdy.  The drain is slow, so add another 2 minutes for draining to total wash time.  I found it was easier to place in the bathtub and just turn upside down and let it drain from the top.  But then you're in the bathtub, leaning over doing all this, getting wet, for a good 6 minutes, for about two days of laundry (single person)...your back will not say thank you.  More trouble than its worth.  Finally, I usually hang dry my clothes anyway to save money on dryers, but having no spin cycle actually makes a difference.  Trying drying corduroys in a reasonable amount of time without wringing each clothing item...add another 3 minutes.<br /><br />If you wanted to bring on a camping trip it might be ok, but again, it could be designed much better.  For an RV it would probably be fine but I'd worry about breaking it on a camping trip (all plastic parts).<br /><br />In summary, for a \"normal\" person trying to use in their apartment, this wont work.  For someone who is super eco friendly and doesn't mind spending a ton of time doing their laundry, you'll probably enjoy this.",

Do not buy this POS if you want a real Aqua-Pure filter.<br /><br />UPDATE: After seller insisted in Questions that this filter is made in the USA and only assembled in China, I decided to test it to see if his additional claim that it works as well as any other filter is true. I tested it with the TDS meter I use to monitor the RO/DI water purifier I use for my saltwater aquarium. First, I ran 5 gallons of water through this filter installed in my Samsung fridge. The water was black for a while, but it cleared up by gallon 3. Instructions say run it for 5 minutes to flush carbon dust, and it took about 7 minutes to pull 5 G.<br /><br />Measured TDS for the &#34;Aqua-Pure compatible&#34; was 138 PPM. Then I measured unfiltered tap water, and once again got 138 PPM. I repeated the test three times on each water source and got the same figures, +/- 1 PPM.<br /><br />Consequently, I know that this device does not filter water at all and is certainly not compatible with Aqua Pure. It works no better than having no filter at all in the fridge.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: The genuine Aqua Pure doesn't reduce TDS either, so it appears that fridge filters are a waste of money even when they're not falsely promoted.",

I haven't dented it or anything, but it would dent easily.<br /><br />I would do no more than 30 grams of coffee at a time, and for that amount it takes me 90-120 seconds before I hit the point of diminishing return, but that will vary depending on how consistent your grinder is.

I am still perfecting this technique, but simply shaking it up and down is much less effective.",

I don't like in-the-door water/ice dispensers because I think they're unattractive, and they take up so much room inside.  Mostly I want water - ice I can get from below easily - and this saves so much room not needing to use my big brita.  Am sold on counter depth now because I can see everything so much more easily - the frig is wider and not as deep and that's perfect.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it 5 (or 10) stars is because the stainless is high maintenance.  Nothing seemed to clean it well so I researched it to death (and went through a number of stainless steel cleaners) and followed the recommendation of a lot of people to use Weisman spray cleaner with a microcloth.  That works really really well - but I wish the metals Kitchenaid uses would require less maintenance.  I'm aware now and in the habit of keeping my hands off the doors as much as possible - using just the handles - but if I had a bunch of kids in the house it'd drive me batty.<br /><br />I'd buy this frig again in a heartbeat.

    "text": "Hario has farmed out production of its authorized filter papers to several other factories. These other factories use different paper from the original--which results in a slower draw-down time when you brew--and added a tab. For some time after the introduction of the newer filters, the original untabbed, smoother-feeling, quicker-brewing filters have been available from Hario in boxes of 40...you know, the ones in the picture.<br /><br />I ordered a single box of 40 in March, as I have been doing for some time now. When it was time to order more, I clicked on my previous order and was sent to this page where I was being offered 10 boxes of 40 untabbed filters. Since the picture showed white filters without tabs in boxes of 40, I assumed this was the original filter.<br /><br />When the box arrived, I noticed immediately that the picture on the box showed a tabbed filter. And sure enough, that's what they are. The newer, more coarse filters with a different extraction time from the original.<br /><br />I should have read the Amazon page more closely, because under \"About This Item,\" it says \"The filter has a tab for ease of handling. (Improved from March 2022),\" But the picture showed untabbed filters and my re-order page directed me to this page, so I assumed I'd be getting what I'd always been getting.<br /><br />I decided to open a box and try a couple of them to be fair. And I discovered that I don't like them. But since I opened a box, I guess I can't return them.<br /><br />If you want the original filters, you can only find them in boxes of 40...AND the box needs to indicate, in the lower right hand, Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification #C116196. The tabbed version says on the box FSC# C161936. Aside from that, the two boxes (except for the picture of the tab on the outside) are identical.<br /><br />Of course, the pictures on the Amazon's page show the original untabbed filters with the original's FSC certification number.<br /><br />But that's not what you'll be getting.<br /><br />I'll look around for vendors that sell the original untabbed papers for consumers like me who realize that in terms of coffee-brewing, these new papers make the Hario V60 coffee brewer, in effect, a completely different product due to the difference in draw-down time.<br /><br />Whoever is responsible for this bait-and-switch, whether it's Hario or Amazon...I'm disappointed.",

We typically drink pour over coffee using a Hario and we grind our Starbucks House Blend Medium Roast Beans. It's been good, but with the weather getting hot I have been craving iced coffee. So, I ordered this cold brew basket, I ground up a little over 1 1/2 Cups of course coffee, put it in the basket and filled the 64oz jar with filtered water. I let it sit on the counter for 15 hours. I ended up with an iced cold brew coffee that tasted as if I went to Starbucks and ordered an iced vanilla latte! I used Davinci vanilla syrup and whole organic milk and no joke it taste just like espresso coffee. The next brew batch, I am using 2 cups of ground coffee for a more concentrated coffee. We buy the 40oz Starbucks beans from Sam's. I found the basket to be just fine for this purpose and it even came with a silicone ring to go around the top edge of the basket. I also bought  a lid with a flip cap for the wide mouth jar and it works beautifully to pour the coffee with. Another reviewer had mentioned to use a wide mouth canning funnel to pour the coffee grounds into the basket while it is in the jar and that worked really well and saved a lot of mess.",

Because it was exactly what we were looking for.<br />I originally was going to get black gap covers to keep food from falling between our range and counter, but our range was stainless steel. After finding these, the price was a little steep to justify. Aesthetically, this was much nicer and looked almost custom, so we went sooth what we liked and are glad we did.<br />They fit perfectly between the range and our 25\" deep counters.<br />They do the job in keeping food from getting between the gaps. They're also easy to remove and clean. We use the same stainless steel cleaner we use on all of our appliances.<br />The only thing I can recommend to do ahead of time is to measure your counters. That's it.",

Last time it was the outlet pump, so I cleaned it out (I found 3.00 in change, candy wrappers, etc.) and still got the error. Now I wasn't getting any water in my machine. Tested the hoses okay, so I Googled &#34;Why doesn't my Whirlpool Duet washer fill with water&#34; and it turned out it could be one of several issues. Isolated to the input valve and ordered it from Amazon with same day shipping. This turned out to be a sub 30 minute fix. Now we're back to good as new without paying for a repairman. Research took about an hour and the fix was about 30 minutes, while the part was under 40. Well worth it in my book.",
