It makes the weakest coffee ever - the water comes out so quickly that it spurted out the entire bottom of the spout area and made a mess on my counter. (See pic) I really tried everything to make this work. I tried using Cuisinart K-cups, tried using the reusable cup filter supplied with the product itself, tried making very small cups of coffee which doesn't make sense since that required 2 k-cups and brewing two 4oz coffee amounts to equal one decent 8oz cup... so it really isn't a good machine unless you enjoy cleaning up spurts and drinking watery weak brew.",

    "text": "On March 16, 2016, I called Electrolux to request a warranty repair of my then 10-week old dishwasher.  The phone rep asked numerous questions, including what, exactly, was wrong with my dishwasher.  She then instructed me how to try to &#34;reset&#34; the dishwasher (which failed), and then she scheduled what I thought was a repair appointment, five days later on March 21.  The rep asked me whether I preferred a repair time window of 8:00 a.m. to Noon, or Noon to 5:00.  I said I preferred morning as I had an afternoon appointment.  The rep then told me that Whitman Appliance Repair would contact me the day before to tell me my specific appointment time.  The day before, sure enough Whitman called, only to tell me that would see me between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.  I said that Electrolux scheduled me for 8:00 a.m. to Noon.  Whitman said they could come between 10:00 and 2:00, or they could reschedule for a later date.  So at the last minute, I had to schedule an entire vacation day off work, and reschedule my afternoon meeting.  On March 21, Whitman arrived as scheduled.  The repair technician walked into my house, looked at my dishwasher, and said, &#34;what's wrong with it?&#34;  I said, &#34;didn't Electrolux tell you?&#34;  The technician said, &#34;they don't tell us nothing.&#34;  I explained the problem.  He then said, &#34;you need a new blah blah blah&#34; (a part).  &#34;We'll have to order it, it will arrive in 3 to 10 business days.  Then we will call you to schedule the repair.&#34;  He then took a few pictures of my dishwasher, including a picture of the serial number.  He was in my house for all of about 30 seconds.  I said, you mean I wasted a whole day's vacation so you could ask me the exact same question that I already answered for the Electrolux phone rep?&#34;  He said, we'll, I needed to get the serial number.&#34;  I said, &#34;I needed to tell the phone rep the serial number before she would schedule the repair!&#34;  He said, &#34;I also needed to take pictures of your dishwasher to document any pre-existing damage, so you can't sue us to fix something that wasn't our fault.&#34;  Great!  I blew an entire vacation day so that Electrolux and Whitman Appliance Repair could cover their butts.  Finally, on March 29 -- 19 days after I called Electrolux, I got to schedule yet another vacation day and my dishwasher was finally repaired.  The complete lack of even basic communication between Electrolux and Whitman and the long (half-day) appointment windows for repair convince me that Electrolux and Whitman Appliance have absolutely no regard for customer service.  I will think long and hard before I ever buy another Electrolux appliance.  NEW TOPIC:  The dishwasher I replaced was a very low-end model.  The Electrolux was, at $888 retail, what I thought was a mid-to-high range model.  It has a stainless steel interior and a third rack, which I liked.  However, I learned the expensive way that a more expensive dishwasher does NOT clean my dishes any better than a cheap one.  The ONLY real difference between my old dishwasher and the new Electrolux, is that the Electrolux is quieter when running.  However, the noise level of my old dishwasher never bothered me or my family.  Or bedrooms and TV room are separate floors from the kitchen, so we rarely heard the old dishwasher.  And even if we were sitting nearby, we could converse or play music or do whatever without ever being bothered by the dishwasher.  If I ever have to buy another dishwasher, I'll choose a cheap one (and very lucky NOT an Electrolux).",

Do not put very heavy things in or you will wear out the spinner, do not use a lot of washing liquid (or it will be like putting hand dish liquid in the dishwasher)... clothes can get tangled, so watch over it.

Using these filters on the reusable cup stops that.<br /><br />I fold back the front part of the paper at the filter and get the top lid to snap when the flap closes.  This eliminates grounds getting out of the filter.<br /><br />People do say they don't get the same strong coffee with a filter.  I put my setting at \"Strong\" and the second cup setting.  I'll admit it did bother me the first two times.  A month later am still enjoying no residue.<br /><br />Have been saving the used paper and grounds by placing them in my EPICA Stainless Steel Compost Bin.  In March I'll spread the recyclable paper and grounds around in an effort to discourages slugs and Asian Worms that are eating up the shallow nutrients on my property.<br /><br />If you find this review was helpful please checkoff the \"helpful\" box.

I empty after use and put the grounds into a compost bin by the sink, which then gets composted into my land.<br /><br />I recommend you don't fill your container to the top.  You need enough coffee/loose tea so that when you close the lid you'll hear or feel a click.<br /><br />Then I'll rinse off the grounds from the empty container.  Sometimes I wash in my dishwasher basket which cleans out the oils.  When dried you reuse for another perfect cup of coffee.  If you don't have a dishwasher basket put them in a mesh bag.<br /><br />For $9 I've gotten two years of use and they're still in great shape.  I've stopped counting how much money I've saved by not buying already filled K Cups.",

I just got my Keurig (which I would never have gotten myself - who needs that?) and am having such fun with it.  It came with many different coffees and I'm narrowing it down to the ones I like.  I will put this single Kcup to lots of use with my own coffee eventually,  A reviewer emphasized how you should put coffee grounds down the sink.  It's pretty easy to knock them off into the garbage can.  I have the carafe cup as well.",

It truly does boil water in 90 seconds. The finish is perfect and the install was very simple. We also now had a reason to finally get new pots and pans. We didn't spend a ton on the new induction pans but we did make sure that the bottoms were completely free of sharp edges or burrs.  The cooktop came with some cleaning compound and we're still using the same bottle 9 months later. Once a week I usually just wipe the top off with a paper towel and water and follow that up with a few drops of the cleaner and then just buff that off with a paper towel. The surface has only picked up 2 very small scratches that were probably caused by a full house of Easter company when they were using it as a place to put their hot food dishes. =(  If anything were to accidentally happen to this one I wouldn't hesitate to buy the exact same cooktop again. My only issue is that the top glass surface is not perfectly flat from front to back. It has a very slight hump in the middle but it's only noticeable to me since I installed it and looked at it edge on. The other issue is that led control panel has moved slightly down about 1/8\" on the left side which  means that you now need to press about 1/8\" lower for the touch control to register. I might see what's involved with moving it back into the correct position at some point in the future if it continues to slip.",

However, usually it is somewhere between 40-50 degrees, and it takes 2+ days to cool a flat of 35 sodas from room temperature to this range. I don't open the door frequently (probably twice a day on average, and not at all while waiting on the sodas to cool initially). After a few months it was spending more time towards 50 degrees and less time towards 40 degrees and I noticed there was a significant amount of frost built up on the back of the fridge, which can impair performance. It seems it needs manual defrosting every once in a while.<br /><br />Overall, this is a \"ok\" beverage fridge. It's attractive, and the glass door makes it easy to see what's inside (and read a refrigerator thermometer) without opening the door. However, there are very few things other than beverages that can be safely stored in a refrigerator with poor temperature control, so I wouldn't recommend it at all if you want to store anything perishable.

Works great, and saves lots of money.  I will definitely purchase more of these in the future. When initially installed the first gallon of water comes out black from the charcoal but once its flushed, it is a great filtration system.",

    "text": "Used this for about two months now and am loving it in my tiny apartment with no W/D hookups (or room for a w/d anyway, ha). It's been absolutely excellent for the price. I wish I could tell everyone at the laundromat about it. That being said, it is a small washer and you can't expect it to be capable of the same things as a full size machine. Treat it right, and it should last.<br /><br />What are the steps?<br />The basic order is either wash in the washer -> drain -> rinse in the washer -> drain -> spin dry in the dryer - OR - wash in the washer -> transfer clothes to the dryer and fill for a rinse (conserving your washer water for another load) -> drain dryer and dry. You can either rinse in the washer or the spin bucket, so you are able to re-use your washer water if doing multiple loads.<br /><br />Pros<br />> Gets your clothes clean. I feel like my clothes are cleaner with this than a laundromat washer, ha.<br />> Runs relatively quietly (There is the sound of water, and a light humming while it spins).<br />> Slim size fits in/on top of many places<br />> Lightweight. I'm a 130 lbs marshmallow and have no problem lifting it (without water in it, ofc)<br />> Fast...wash cycles run ~12 minutes, rinse ~9, and dry ~9.<br />> SO much more convenient than leaving the house to do laundry<br />> Eventually pays for itself if you don't otherwise have access to a free washer/dryer.<br /><br />Cons(?) More like, things to be aware of and how to work around them:<br />> I can't stress enough, this is not a full-sized machine. You can't work it like a traditional large, sturdy, metal washer. It makes a light burning plastic smell with larger loads, & I've never filled it higher than about halfway between the Med and High fill lines out of fear of over-stressing the motor. Not made to do all your weekly laundry in one day (unless it's a single person's maybe), but more like 2, 3 loads max a day...meaning multiple laundry days a week may be needed. This is in order to preserve the life of your machine becaaauuusseee...<br />> The only -actual- con: this company seems unresponsive with inquiries about replacements/repairs, as other reviewers have noted.<br /><br />> Must elevate to drain properly. If the drain hose makes the water travel against gravity at any point (i.e. UP), it won't drain all the way. I've remedied this by putting it on a storage tub to drain ~90% and then lifting it a couple inches to completely drain the rest.<br /><br />> No heated dryer. Spin dryer does get clothes about 90~95% dry though, much dryer than just-out-of-the-wash. I was in disbelief when I first used it, ha. To prevent stiff clothes, add a bit of white vinegar to your washer run. It's a little stiffer than your usual heated dryer, but not like you paid for starch at the dry cleaners. It hasn't bothered me at all.<br /><br />> How...do I...fill it? It does come with a hose but that probably won't fit your sink. I use the shower-head from my bath tub and fill it directly. Others fill buckets and then pour in the water from there. Others have bought adapters for -make- the hose fit their sink. Others utilize the dustpan sink funnel technique<br /><br />> It's super noisy/wobbly/chaotic! = It's probably overloaded. Aside from the first and last ~7 seconds of the spin dryer, it shouldn't be moving much at all. Neither tub should be filled to the top; your clothes need room to move!",

When I replaced the original Wolf igniter with this cheaper version, the old housing was perfect - lasted 14 years.  One year later, igniter fails and the housing is badly damaged.  My guess is that the resistance was too low, thereby drawing too many amps, getting too hot, and burning itself and other parts up.<br /><br />The second photo shows the OEM replacement.  Wolf supplies not only an igniter, but replacement brackets and housing.  Good thing since my older housing was melted.  It also has much longer leads which can be easily pulled into the electrical connector area beneath the cooktop.  No need to have wire nuts exposed in the oven now.<br /><br />The OEM version is three times the price, but lasts 10 times longer and doesn't pull too much power and melt things.  Just glad that it didn't burn out an electrical module controlling things in the process.  Cheaper is not better in this case.",

Yes you have to heat the water separately but, for me, it is worth it.  There is a rather zen thing about it all.<br /><br />Plus, you get to buy the carafe(s) you want so you can get a cool carafe.

It did fit in well enough to use, or so I thought, even thought the last 1/4 wouldn't turn for some reason.  Well, I discovered later that this was causing a slow leak under the refrigerator.  I bought 3 of these, will throw the other two out at this point.  I just re-ordered a different brand that claims to fit Kenmore 9915.  I wish I could find the actual Kenmore filters on Amazon.

Unlike the other reviewers..... this shelf does not seem like a different brand or sturdier than the original to me.  It seems identical to the one I replaced quite frankly.  At the risk of having to replace yet another $80 shelf, or worse, having a catastrophic collapse in my refrigerator at 2 am, I reinforced the weak points underneath this new shelf with white Marine Tex (molds like epoxy, hardens like steel, sands like wood).  I'm happy to say I'm now enjoying what seems like a pretty sturdy shelf.  It doesn't deflect when I place a gallon of milk on it anymore.",

Then yesterday, I accidentally bumped the knob on the front burner and turned on the low heat. Within seconds the whole room smelled like burning tires. I quickly took the cover off and, thank heavens, was able to scrub the rubber or whatever it is off the stove top with CeramaBryte cooktop cleaner. But the underside of the cover is too sticky to put back on the stove so I have to buy a new one. I'll use this one upside down until the new one arrives. I recommend getting a color other than black so you remain super-aware that this is on the cooktop and are careful not to bump the knobs or accidentally turn it on thinking it is your black cooktop.",

But, if having a self-cleaning oven is important to you - walk away! This stove, and others, have what is called their new \"AquaLift Self Cleaning System\". Well, let me tell you what that means. You pour two cups water in the bottom of the oven, turn on the self cleaning which runs about 45 minutes, then you get down on your hands and knees and sop out all the water with a rag. Then you wipe and scrub and wipe and scrub for 30 minutes. Then you break down, go to the store and buy oven cleaner spray, and then you get back on your hands and knees and scrub some more. Look, I like my oven clean so I clean it regularly. I can't EVEN imagine how it would work if the oven was really nasty. I love the stop top, but give the the old fashioned, turn on a million degrees overnight and wipe out the ashes with a paper towel the next morning. I've resorted to lining my oven with tin foil, like my grandmother used to. The AquaLift system=Not Self Cleaning!",

Sometimes I make my coffee in a short Yeti and sometimes in a tall one.  As for the filter, here's the deal: it is a mesh that is permanently  connected to the outer cone.  After a couple of years the water would not run through anymore because the space between the cone and the mesh was clogged with who-knows-what.  I would clean it with vinegar but it still didn't work.  I took a single edge razor and trimmed the mesh out.  I like it so much better this way.  I use a paper cone filter which makes clean up so much faster and easier.<br /><br />It's stylish, modern, easy to use, and makes the best pour-over!<br /><br />You won't regret buying this!",

They look alike and they feel alike.  However...  When my light flashed on to replace the filter, I easily replaced it with the spare that came with the fridge.  No issues.  Then I ordered these to have on hand when needed.  About 8 months later (we use a lot of ice and filtered water).  The light started flashing so I replaced it easy as pie with one of these.  I will note that when I tried to flush it with water, the water came out in my cup BLACK!!! It was like this for a good 4 or 5 minutes of running water through the filter.  The ones that came with the fridge never did this..  So once it was running clear, I was happy with my purchase.  However, a couple days later, I noticed that my ice was black.  I dumped it and let the water run through the water on the ice maker water valve.  It ran clear.  I had to dump 2 more bins of ice to get clear ice again..  This took several days to clear it up.  So, still not a deal breaker on these filters.  Then about 2 weeks later, the filter light signal began to flash that it needed to be changed AGAIN.  I removed the filter, drained it and replaced it thinking that it could not be dirty already.  I  ran water through it and it was running clear so I let it flash for a week or 2 longer.  I decided to replace the filter and  the second one out of the 3 pack also ran black water for a few minutes until it finally cleared up. I am one month into using the second filter and the light has came on again.  This is now a bargin if it has to be replaced more often than the originals that came with the fridge.  I will be trying another brand when these are gone..  Do they work?  Yes,  Are they cost effective for the savings if you have to replace them more often?  No...",

    "text": "I bought this for our cabin as I want a cook stove that I can move off the counter when I am not cooking and can use that space for other things.  This arrived as scheduled but the box it was packaged in was torn all to pieces.  The cooktop is black glass and it was not broken but the metal burner parts were all apart and rattling around in what was left of the box.  It took me a while to figure out how all the parts went together but we finally got it.  It comes with a very cheap, think orange propane hose and a  regulator  and that cheap rubber hose just pushes onto the back of the stovetop and there is a metal clamp on it to tighten down with a screwdriver.  Very cheaply done for a stove top that looks this good.  There is no fitting and no way to put a fitting on the stovetop so the only thing to do is use a better made hose and clamp to put the gas line on the stove.  I wish they have done the inlet fitting better.",

Was extremely easy to install & priced well, if in fact OEM. the issue I have is that the auger does not appear to be stainless steel which will in fact begin to form rust/build-up causing the ice to be useless w/an odor too. I am returning this & have ordered another. hopefully the 2nd has a stainless steel auger. I've read reviews, 1 person said it is not stainless steel but another said it was, so I don't know. Maybe there's a 50/50 chance of getting the correct auger w/this alleged OEM part. I even contacted GE & verified it's supposed to come w/a stainless steel auger.<br />Update: 3/31/22<br />The 2nd bin w/auger arrived but unfortunately is same as the initial w/auger that's not stainless steel. Amazons picture clearly shows a shiny stainless steel auger, GE (of whom I also contacted) acknowledges the auger is in fact supposed to be stainless steel too. Yet the auger supplied w/both bins I'd received is not stainless steel. I've returned 1 & am reluctantly still keeping the other. it does work fine, I just don't know how long before this imitation stainless steel auger begins to rust which will cause the ice to taste foul etc. GE offered to sell me their product but it would've been about another $100 & I'm opting not to go that route right now.",

With four children we needed a calendar that provided plenty of room - the stickers add fun and also get our attention when the writing becomes too familiar.  I KNOW people use their phones for calendar but I have never been able to fully make the switch.  My favorite feature is the pouch in the back - appt cards from the doctor/dentist, printed out sports and Church serving schedules, etc go right in the pouch and are readily available if there is a discrepancy written on the date. Even though I only have one still at home my college-aged kids balked when I said I was going to do away with the wall calendar this year.  So I bought it again.

We had to wait another week until another new panel came in. When they finally installed the second new display unit, they took a reading and saw that our fridge  and freezer were NOT keeping temperature all that time, so we had to toss out ALL of our food! It's been a few months since the last repair and it seems to be working for now. But we fight freezer burn, the water and ice is delayed so it's always spilling, and the motor is very loud! It makes constant buzzing sounds and is very loud when it kicks on the cooling unit. Not nice when you have an open floor plan and the fridge is as loud as the tv.

By a soft switch I mean one that you have to touch exactly the right way for a precise interval. Seems to be the norm today. The simple task of turning this unit on is a big job.  Takes me at least 7 tries and I usually have to unplug it (which involves moving it) and plug it back in a couple of times. If I am patient and try enough times it eventually powers up. Not acceptable. Unfortunately, because I became ill with Covid19 I missed the return window. So now I am going to try the warranty route with the manufacturer. Not a happy buyer.",

The delivery may not be the fault of the seller however the dent was total lack of quality control. The hood was packaged in Styrofoam and a strip of removable film (typically placed on metal to prevent scratches) ran all along the front edge of the hood‚Ä¶ Right where the dent was.  It appears the dent was there before the film was put in place.  The exterior of the box was in perfect shape and secure so it definitely happened at the factory.  Maybe it was a second?  Anyway, I got a Klein wrench which had vinyl-dipped handles and a hammer, laid the wrench handle along the inside of the dent and punched out the dent so it's not too noticeable. The color is black so unless I point it out, no one will notice.  The light and fan motor work fine.",

    "text": "I ordered this washer/dryer combo for my 85-year-old mom who lives 5 hours away from me.  After several years, the dryer on her second EdgeStar brand combo stopped working.  I tried to order a replacement from Lowe's, but they kept moving the delivery date back and I finally just cancelled the order.  I ordered this Equator on Amazon on January 10, 2021.  The estimated delivery date was the end of February, but Mom had it on January 20.  That is fantastic since it traveled all the way from California to WV.  The gentlemen working for Pilot Freight brought it into her home instead of leaving it out on her porch.  SO WONDERFUL!  Mom has a lot of red in her home and both of her previous combos were white.  She is SO PLEASED that this combo is RED!  Mom had someone set it up for her, BUT they failed to follow the setup instruction so the first time she used the machine, it bounced off the wheeled platform my brother had made for her previous combos and made a terrible racket.  She tried to hold it down but it \"flung her around\".  As it turns out, the packing material needs to be removed from the stabilizing bars as per the instructions.  (NOTE:  I would have bought her the wheeled model, but it didn't come in red.)<br /> Anyway, she got some help, the packing material was removed and she says it runs very smoothly, it's very QUIET, more quiet and lighter than her previous combos so it's easier to move, does a great job and doesn't have a scratch on it.  She says the clothes come out wrinkled at first, but she hangs them promptly, per the instructions, and the wrinkles hang out.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, Amazon.  I knew you would DELIVER!",

You need to do the cleaning process (easy, no special equipment, nothing gross) about once a week.<br /><br />3. Hard water will have an impact. The minerals in your water impact the taste so you might not want totally soft, purified water, but hard water will leave residue and if you don't clean the device once every 1 or two weeks then it might clog up.

Lately we have noticed the lights turn on by themselves.  I'm talking every other day.  We will come upstairs from our bedroom and the hood vent light will be on.  It shuts off when we push the touchscreen to shut it off, but it comes on by itself randomly.  I dont see a contact seller option to get this fixed, if the seller reads this please get a hold of me or we will be returning!",

The &#34;covered dairy bin&#34; and &#34;covered storage bin&#34; in either door are quite useless for anything larger than a stick of butter.  I reclaimed some storage options by removing the covers from both bins.  Also, storage of tall beverage containers (e.g., a wine bottle) is always challenging and necessitates constant rearranging of other items and/or shelves. It took me a couple months of experimenting with various shelf heights to come up with an acceptable arrangement.  I wish the left-hand door closed a bit slower -- it's quite annoying to have it crashing into my arm as I'm trying to extricate items from the fridge.",

Performed lengthy descaling process no less than 12 times but the light never turned off. Did not know if descaling complete or unity malfunctioning.<br /><br />REGISTER your unit for warranty service!<br /><br />Advise those who have problem with their single serve coffee brewer or any other Cuisinart product, to contact the company by phone. I first tried an email to the company asking for assistance but the advice proved ineffective.<br />The CS rep listened to my report of the problem and promptly issued a ticket for a new replacement brewer. UPS picked up the old one four days after my contact.The new unit was promised within 7-10 days of my call I received it today 11-17-17, 7 days later.<br /><br />Likes: appearance, large volume water reservoir, water filter, number of options for brew size, brew temp, brewing speed (it is fast!), options to make just hot water for tea, soup and hot chocolate, cleaning cycle function, programming for various other preferences, clarity of user instructions in manual and unit controls, 3 year warranty, and many other neat features. A three year warranty is a bit surprising given that most electronic devices have only a one year length. I think $120 for the unit is reasonable. $100 and up seems to me to be the starting point for better quality single cup brewers.<br /><br />Love the versatility of this machine!<br /><br />Want to make espresso? Why buy an espresso machine when this will do it? Take a dark roast coffee, Italian, French or any other and brew on 4 ounce setting. Whoa! Close enough to true espresso without the special grinding, packing the brew unit and clean up.<br /><br />If a dark roast K cup is still too strong brewed on the 12 oz., setting, the leave it in and brew again on 4 oz., and you have a perfect cup of lighter dark roast.<br /><br />Based on function, quality of build and warranty service I recommend this product.",

    "text": "I ordered two of these to replace a couple of older ones because the lids cracked in half (see photo). I've had four or five of these lids break along the left side, up to the red disc. Happens every time after a few months of use. Anyway, I haven't had the new ones long enough to see if they too will break, but I'm not a fan of the redesign. The new design has a wire basket with a lid, like the old one, but the basket then goes inside a plastic shell with a single hole in the bottom. So preparing one for use requires two steps instead of one, and cleaning is a pain. The old basket had a &#34;handle&#34; that I used to rap on the edge of a bowl to shake the grounds loose (I save my grounds for gardening). The new basket lacks the handle and is generally sort of flimsy, making it difficult to empty.<br />Also, the new design allows you to make either a cup or a carafe. Okay, not a bad idea, except that now you have to go through another menu, in which you must select either a picture of a carafe or a number, 1-6; then you get to another screen where you can select the size. There's really no explanation of what the numbers mean (I know, it's probably in the Keurig manual somewhere) so we just guess and then see what we get.<br />The whole thing is annoying. Amazon is famous for reducing transactional friction; it's disappointing when a company goes out of its way to increase friction.<br />On the plus side, a cup of coffee seems to brew more quickly. Haven't actually timed the two models, but it feels faster.<br />Regarding Keurig customer service: I recently posted a question about the cracking lids, and someone from Keurig suggested that I call customer support. I did, and it was a waste of time. The rep took all my personal info down and said he would pass it on to someone else who might be able to do something about replacing the broken lids. Or not, he wasn't sure. That was the last I've heard from them.",

    "title": "most durable, not easiest to clean",
    "text": "I've tried three kinds of refillable pods for the Keurig 2.0: this one, the ones made by Keurig, and a generic purple plastic kind. There are two factors that set them apart: durability and ease of cleaning. This one (the metal Fill 'n Save) appears to be the most durable, although I've owned it for the shortest time, so I could be proven wrong. However, the weaknesses of the other two are caused by their plastic construction. The purple plastic ones are flimsy. The tops are barely held on by a plastic hinge that is destined to break after a few dozen uses; also, one bent almost in half after I banged it against a plastic garbage container trying to get the used coffee grounds out.<br />The pods made by Keurig are made of sturdier plastic, and the tops screw on. However, of the three that I bought, one top is cracked and another came apart--the filter fell off the bottom. This filter can be reattached, but it falls off almost every time it is used.<br />So I would say that the metal version is destined to be more durable; however, I have to give the edge to Keurig for &quot;cleanability,&quot; and this is a crucial factor, because the only real reason to use disposable pods is that you don't have to clean them. The Keurig wins this point because the pod has a little handle, just big enough to hold onto while you rap the container against the edge of a garbage can (or in our case a ceramic bowl that we use to collect the grounds, which are later sprinkled on our Azaleas). Also, the detached lid means the lid doesn't get in the way while you're trying to knock the grounds loose.<br />In sum, I prefer the Keurig because ease of cleaning is crucial. Although two of three are somewhat broken, they are still usable. If cleanability doesn't matter to you because you rinse your grounds down the disposal, you might prefer the metal version. The purple ones are much cheaper, but they're almost designed to be disposable, which partially defeats the purpose of buying refillable pods.",

This wouldn't be so bad, but the temperature NEVER recovers if food is being cooked.  Opening the door again to turn the pizza (the oven doesn't cook evenly...the left side cooks faster) temperature drops to 350F...too low to bake pizza.  Also, Cadco told me temperature recovery should be 10 degrees per minute. No way!<br />With food in the oven it NEVER recovers.<br /><br />FORGET about cooking more than one item at a time...the temperature drops so low it will never cook.  It might even go to zero and freeze it.<br /><br />Our plan was to use this oven to bake 12-15 pizzas per hour.<br />For this much money I am thoroughly disappointed.  This &#34;commercial&#34; grade oven literally can't handle baking one pizza.<br /><br />For $100 I can buy a Wesco pizza oven that fits in my back seat.

These bolts prevent the tub from pulling out of the suspension system, remove them when you tip the washer back up.  So thankful for the reviews here that describe this install method!
