    "title": "Much better than the similarly priced GE unit this replaced.",
    "text": "The GE range hood we had in our kitchen wasn't providing sufficient suction causing fire alarms to activate when cooking over high heat. And the stainless steel case of the GE hood was thin and had very sharp corners. It was also completely open under the hood (literally!) except for the small filter which was attached in an unsecured manner under the 7\" fan in the middle. After less than 2 years of use, the GE fan started making clicking sounds, so it was time to replace.<br /><br />After doing some online research, we decided to go with the Broan model as it had a higher CFM rating and much better reviews overall. Order from Amazon was delivered promptly in secure but easy to open packaging. This range hood several exhaust configuration options, including the 7\" vertical ducting option needed for our installation. Even though the instructions are generally easy to follow. The first step is to break a few spot weld connections using a mallet and a screwdriver to remove metal parts not needed. I was able to install this unit mostly by myself. One neat trick is to put the unit on a piece of cardboard that is 30\" wide and drill holes on the cardboard to mark the mounting screw locations. They you can tape the cardboard template under the counter where the hood will be placed and drill the pilot holes in the exact locations they are supposed to go. Once you drive the mounting screws (leaving about 1/4\" between the screw head and the counter), you can then slide the hood into place and secure it by tightening the mounting screws.<br /><br />The quality of the Broan stainless steel enclosure is much better than the GE unit it replaced. It also looks elegant with rounded edges and corners and need control buttons. The entire bottom of the unit is covered with two large mesh filters, which aesthetically looks better but also helps with suction as it provides a much larger filter surface for air to flow through.<br /><br />Broan unit has a much larger fan than the GE unit it replaced. While it provides much better suction, it is also much quieter. It has three speeds and at the slowest speed, you hardly hear the fan running.<br /><br />Overall, I we are very happy with this product.",

I thought well maybe that is how this one is supposed to be so I do everything else and it start putting the bearing in crooked. bad bad bad, so I carefully tap the bearing out of the tub as to not damage either. so I get the bearing back out and go back to the drawing board. I can flip the top bearing seat over to press the bearing in. Awesome... well almost, now with the bearing holder flipped over the bar that hit the tub to hold it all in place doesn't reach... so I change some things around and put it below the nut... not really the way it should be but it worked, except then nothing held the spacer tube in the proper place so the drive shaft could not slide through. So, I very carefully tap the bottom bearing a little so I cane move the spacer tube enough to get the shaft through and just used the nut on the shaft to finish seating the bottom bearing. all in all this tool did help me fix my washer, but because it did not function the way it was meant too it did add considerable time to the already daunting repair. hopefully you will have better luck if you buy this one but if I could do it over I would have spent more money to get a better tool, even if it is just a one time use.",

I am not using the rinsing/drying agent (whatever that thing is) and it works well for me.<br /><br />The images where they load the dishwasher are extremely optimistic, there's no way you can put all this dishware in there, and you probably shouldn't anyway. My 12&#34; plates fit just fine, but they steal a space on the other side.<br /><br />This machine is very silent, except for the few times where it flushes water, but really, it's not disturbing at all. The adapter fits perfectly on my faucet and it's easy to connect and disconnect. I just run water until it gets hot, then plug it in, turn on the dishwasher and sometime later, when it beeps 8 times, turn off the faucet, press the red button to relieve the water pressure, disconnect the water, open the door ajar, come back later when it's all dry and cold and voilà!<br />Don't handle the content after it's done, it's much too hot and might break, that's valid for all dishwashers...<br /><br />You do want to get rid of large chunks of food by rinsing your plates first, to not risk clogging up the filter.<br /><br />I REALLY LOVE my dishwasher.

I use an oxy laundry detergent but just a dab because you don't want anything too sudsy. I usually use cold to temperate water unless it's socks and undies then I let them wash, sit for 5 mins and wash again. Sparkling white. The washing cycle agitates wonderfully and the spin cycle almost completely dries the clothes. They're barely damp. I turn on my fan and they are dry in a half an hour. I have to put the machine up on a small table that's about the same height as my bathtub because there's no pump to get the water out of the machine, it drains via gravity. I thought about buying a small pool pump but for now it's fine. I've saved 30 dollars a week not going to the laundromat anymore and it's convenient and easy to use. I let it dry after I'm done (keeping the lids open) and I spray it with lysol because I don't want mold to grow on it. Also, keep the lint filter clean after every wash before you rinse so you don't get the fuzz on the clothes in the rinse cycle.  I use my long hose hand held shower head to fill it but it has leads for a small hose. My sink would work but it doesn't come apart to attach a hose. I've never had a leak with this item and I did buy a warranty just in case. But so far all is great!!!!! I've recommended this to other people as well.",

Just temporary until I buy a new washer then I will pass it on to my kids in an apartment. Spinner get them fairly dry and you can hang them up finish drying. It's a working little machine, I would recommend to anyone in a camper or an apartment. Footnote: I bought this sprayer on amazon cut of the sprayer end and ran hose through provided tubing to fill hole. This attached it to faucet and made it easier to fill.",

    "text": "First I want to say a big thank you to Amazon. I ordered this on a Friday and it showed up at the house the next morning at 9 am. The crew was very professional. The package was well packed with no issues about damage, all the bolts were there. It came with directions which could be in larger fonts for us old people. Everything on the washer worked as it should no issues at all. It was very easy to assemble all you need is a ratchet 17mm and 19mm sockets took about 5 minutes to assemble. This washer is for the home DIY  person I can not see this washer surviving in a tough professional shop environment. Remember it is an OEM product they sell some really good stuff and they also sell some real garbage as well. I will give an update in a month or so, also I sprayed the levelers with anti corrosion spray made by CRC no doubt in my mind that they will rust.<br />First update: So far so good I used some very high Ph degreasers through this washer and it has done its job this beats a can of kerosine and a paint brush any day.  Second Update 5/10/21 washer still holding up very well very important to keep it clean. I have put some of the strongest degreasers through this washer no issues.  I read one bad review, we all at one time get something that is damaged in shipping send it back and get another. Amazon and the OEM can not control the buffoons who ship that stuff and damage it.  Still Happy With Purchase",

Unless you have dollies and know how ... get it delivered and beside and set up from a local vendor . The small savings was quickly erased and then some by the delivery process . Plus , this was a 2019 model vs the 2020 model . The door was also dented and scratched at the factory . They are in the process of replacing the door . I'll update if they don't make good on the repair .<br />Update : 11/13/20 . The seller has been a nightmare to deal with . I get more apologies then action . As of this writing I've discovered that the refrigerator was technically a year old and the warranty had expired . The four that came in damaged is not covered to be replaced because the seller never submitted the paid receipt to Samsung . I've spent literally hours trying to fix this mess  they made .

    "text": "I'm rating four stars because I've replaced other parts several times. I'm not sure on the longevity so ...4 stars for now .<br /><br />Used this kit as Whirlpool and Kitchenaid parts are interchangeable. I have left scathing comments on how bad the quality of the rack slider wheels and adjustments are on a supposed top of the line product by Kitchenaid. This kit I do have to say is much better quality and out of the box appears to be much better than the other replacement parts I've purchased for my machine KUDS30FX SS1 . I pulled my model number , searched Kitchaid's site and got the part numbers I needed and put them in search on Amazon . It crossed referenced this kit from Whirlpool. I ordered the kit for the top rack . The directions are ok , but I watched the YouTube video posted on the installation and that had great tips. Here is my tip . The kit comes with this one  black plastic screw, it's not clear as to its use , or it wasn't to me. This is the adapter you'll need to use your Phillips head screw driver to finish driving in the four screws that secure the wheels to stainless steel slide. Your Phillips screw driver will not fit the screws provided. Insert that one screw into the screw heads provided and then you can drive the screws down all the way . Silly as to why they used this method but ...<br />The YouTube is also good to watch for tips on how to remove the old system . I highly recommend a viewing . You can stop and back up as you need . Once I watched it was a ten minute job to install the new kit. I didn't attach a link but it's easy to find and there may be others to view as well.<br /><br />The new kit has a steel slide and is very sturdy. The wheels are still plastic but overall it appears to be better. This will be about the fourth time I've rebuilt my rack or repaired issues . Kitchenaid really dropped the ball on this and they made it worse by the price they charged for the fix. At least this kit was somewhat reasonable compared to past expenses incurred to fix the corners they cut during manufacturing .",

The price on these cheaply made , plastic, injected molded clips is on par with what the U.S. government pays for toliet seats and hammers. I have a KUD 30 FX 3 S1 Kitchen Aid model with top adjustable rack. These clips break constantly and the rack takes four (4) that's about $80.00 for these cheap plastic clips. If you don't replace the rack droops and doesn't meet up with the water port for the rack leaving the top dishes dirty . There are also the adjustable thumb latches that need to be repacked frequently too . Bad quality . Shame on Whirpool and Kitchen Aid.

That alone is worth the extra money this unit costs.<br /><br />It is extremely difficult to find the benefits of drinking distilled water not to mention the benefits of cooking with it, but one thing you should know is, distilled truly does make a slower melting, harder, superior tasting clear ice.<br /><br />I make my coffee, tea, and other drinks with distilled water. It never made sense to me, to add ice made with tap water to any of them. That is all my fridges ice maker could make so I never hooked it up. I had to always make and keep filled, my own trays. It seemed I was the only one ever filling the trays as they were used. I frequently found only one cube left for my drinks on the hottest of days which required buying bags of tap water ice, yuck! This unit cures ALL of those issues!<br /><br />This unit does needYuck! manufacture/DIY improvement to stop the water filling the ice trays from splashing into the finished ice in the bin. It eventually melts and/or chunks the ice together. This is no problem if using it right away but putting it in the freezer could make for sloppy looking ice you have to break up, I would not want to serve company.<br /><br />Either in these reviews for this unit or another unit (I can't remember) somebody came up with a DIY make shift flap to help protect the ice from being splashed. I haven't tried it yet, but definately will. Maybe Google it to find it.<br /><br />The noise level is very doable, I have nothing to compare it with really, other than it's equal to the small bullet I keep next to it. I can make ice cold smoothies anytime of the night or day and am enjoying that.<br /><br />I bought the extra insurance this seller offers because I studied up on all ice machines and they can all have issues, regardless of cost. I have read this sellers customer service (if ever needed) is EXCEPTIONAL, but still recommend the extra insurance. Insurance just doesn't cost that much. So far wet ice is my only issue.<br /><br />Rather than wasting more hours than I already had, searching for ice machines that would use distilled water, offered extra insurance along with having awesome customer service, for half of the price of this unit..... I gladly paid a little more to get it all with this unit and would do it again!!",

Watch a YouTube video or two on how to do it - get the special pliers - make sure you have the right gasket.",

It's just the right size and stores an amazing amount of food. The only complaint I have it that the front has several small dents that show up when the light hits it just right. It actually looks more like the way the “stainless steel” skin is attached. But that is a small trade off for such great space and efficient freezing. So glad I purchased this.",

    "text": "I was so excited to receive this product.  I had been dreaming of an induction range for years and when we updated our kitchen I thought the time was right.  It was a little slow in arriving, but that was just a lesson in patience for me.  Two days after it arrived we had modified the cabinet space for it so it would fit and I started cooking on it.  I was blown away.  So fast.  Water started to boil in a fairly large pot in less than a minute and was at full boil in three minutes.  I love how easy the cooktop is to clean.  Matching the pans to the correct diameter cooking area is easy because you have four different sizes to choose from.<br /><br />The convection oven takes a little getting used to.  The waves of heat coming out of the door when I opened it were surprising.  And it took forever for it to cool down.  I checked and rechecked the controls because it felt like the oven was still on.  When I used the oven as a conventional oven I didn't have that problem.  Also, a cookie sheet actually blew over the edge of the oven rack when I opened the door using convection.  I will probably use the oven in the conventional mode more.  It heats up much more quickly than the convection mode too.<br /><br />I say I will probably use that feature because I don't know what will happen after the service technician gets here next week.  I read so many reviews on this range and most were good.  There will always be some bad reviews, but I wish I had paid more attention and definitely wish I had purchased it locally so I could return it.  Just eight days after it arrived the cooktop failed, in the middle of cooking breakfast.  The lights came on and blinked and then shut off.  Later the same day it was working fine.  Still later the problem had returned.  Eight days!  And during that time we were out of town for three days so it didn't get used at all while we traveled.  So really this very expensive induction range lasted all of 5 days and very few meals.  I could not be more disappointed.  GE will be sending a service technician out next week, but in the meantime, we have no way to cook.  Thank heaven that we have a microwave and a toaster oven that can handle most jobs.  I would not recommend this range to anyone.  Take the bad reviews to heart and stay away!<br /><br />UPDATE:  While the GE service man was here we discovered that the problem wasn't in the range, but in the plan placement. By moving a pan less than a quarter of an inch it caused the burner to &#34;catch&#34; or &#34;lose&#34; the pan. You need to be VERY aware of pan size and placement on the top of the range. This can result in not being able to use all the burners if you don't have exactly the right size pan to fit. Yesterday I had to use a much bigger pan than I needed because the smallest burner was already taken and the next size burner would not recognize a small pan. This is explained in the owner's manual, but I didn't realize how precise the size of each pan on each burner has to be. I will probably need to buy a few more pots and pans to accommodate the various size burners.",

I like that aspect, but the adhesive is not for liking the container, rather how it holds up in use and that will be determined by it either holding the dryer glide for the tub I needed to replace.  It it does OK, it is good for another star and I will revisit this review and up from the number to four stars I started with.  I like it well enough",

However, the rubber o-ring that seals the lid shrinks and allows water to flow out of the lid causing a mess and diluting the coffee.

The seal looks straighter, the door closes tighter, and the lock is holding well so far. At least now we know the door is shut as tight as possible, and I think it has to be helping with any cold air loss. It's no extra trouble to open and close the door.

After that, push the button on the motor (because no remote), let it run for 60 minutes (because no 240 minute choice) and then turn it on again ... and again....  And that is all the choice you have.  So, you say, broken, contact them.  Well yes, I did, multiple times.  They finally sent out a new motor and remote.  The ONLY difference between the first and the second is that the second seems to run slower and cooler, so takes even longer to dry.  I'm putting the first one back in, but now it's almost winter, with low humidity, I'll just hang things inside - they'll dry just as fast, and for free.

It's a 25 yr old washer, so it's about time something start failing. If you start seeing a leak under the washer, replacing the pump should be the first thing you should try. In my case, it was very hard to tell where the leak coming from just by looking at it.<br />This was my first time repairing the washer and I was quite nervous before I opened up the machine, so I checked around youtube and watched as many videos as I could find. It helped me build up my confidence.<br />As all repair jobs specially the ones involving water, it's quite messy but the effort is worth it.<br />The delivery was very fast, it took less than a week from the date of order and two days before the estimated delivery.",

    "text": "It works really good for loose tea. It looks strange to see yellow liquid(green tea) with no small leaves at the bottom like I was so used to see but all I see is just a hint of powder in the cup.<br />I also tried coffee. I wasn't so impressed by this. There's a lot of coffee bean silt at the bottom and foamy residue at the top. I'll stick with paper filter for now even though I'm not thrilled by the idea of throwing away disposable paper each time. I thought about deducting one star from this but since I didn't buy it for the coffee, I left it.<br />Over all, it's an excellent product, design, material and built-wise. I brewed tea and coffee then tea again one after another but smell of coffee didn't seem to stay on it. Between each time, all I had to do was rinse it with water, no soap.<br /><br />Now the detailed dimension I wanted to know before I bought it but I couldn't find.<br />Height: 75mm<br /><br />Height to the underside of the top rim(this decides if the basket sits on the bottom of the cup or the top of the cup): 73mm<br /><br />Foot print: 47mm in diameter, quickly tapered(about 45 degree angle) to 52mm(bottom of the mesh cylinder).<br /><br />Top of the mesh cylinder: 57mm in diameter<br /><br />Above the mesh cylinder but underside of the rim(this decides the minimum diameter of the cup when the basket sits on top of the cup): 62mm in diameter.<br />This means, if you have a cup little smaller than 62mm inside diameter at the top, the basket may not go down all the way but maybe partly goes in the cup. Under 57mm, you probably won't get a good result.<br /><br />Far end of the handle to the opposite: 98mm<br />Length of each handle: 18mm<br />This means, if you have a cup between 62mm and 80mm in diameter at the top, the basket sits on the top without positioning. Between 80mm and 98mm, you'll need careful positioning of the basket or the basket will fall in the cup. Above 98mm, it'll always fall, unless the basket sits on the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />*update* (2-20-11)<br />Sample photos have been posted for visual comparison. I hope it'll help your decision making better.",

    "text": "Updated Review:  I noticed on the first use that that top \"spinning\" thing where water comes out would spin the stop, then spin and stop spinning.  I thought maybe this was how it worked.  But then on the second use, the top spinner was spinning fine.  Well, this morning I put my new corelle dishes in for a quick clean and the top spinner didn't spin at all, and water was dripping from the bottom of the door.  Sadly, after speaking with customer service my only option is to return the unit for a refund.  Not an easy task because i'm disabled so my son will have to help me pack up the unit for UPS to pick it up.<br /><br />Original Review: So, I'm not thrilled with the purchase, but I'm not upset either.  I should have read the manual before I purchased it.  It takes 2 hours for a normal wash which includes the dry function - OMG seriously??? This is a fraction of the size of a normal dishwasher and you expect me to run it for 2 hours?  I opted for the rapid wash which took 40 minutes - guess what, no dry function with this option.  Ok, I let my hand washed dishes air dry no biggie.  Well, even 4 hours after the wash was done and the door was left open the dishes were still wet.  Anyway, If you have larger dishes this will not hold 30 items.  I was able to fit 1 large dish, 1 cereal bowl, 4 coffee mugs, one small drinking glass.  I also used the cutlery tray and was able to get 4 spoons and 3 forks on the rack.  Upside is dishes all came out clean.  I cut an eco friendly dishwasher tablet in half.  I think in the future I'll just use a few drops of Dawn as others have commented that they use.  I am considering doing a return because I found another unit that has better cycle options and a separate dry option.  Not sure what I'm going to do.",

Pros: highly efficient, good clean, far fewer problems with the septic system since going to a front loader (family of 7, lots of water use.)  Cons: 1) Very low, need to raise it up.  Instead of $200 \"Pedestal\" I bought four cinder blocks and used a spare (very thick) peice of plywood with moulding around the edges to prevent slippage - it does shift slightly over time.  2) need to prop the door open with a rag to keep the gasket dry so it doesn't grow mold.  Helps to wipe door gasket out occasionally to prevent mold and grime buildup, not a big deal.  Cycle time can be unpredictable, but supposedly due to sensors and machine intelligence.  Normal cycle time starts out at 1:00, gets down to :50, then changes to 1:10.  Overall been a good machine. Switched from decades of loyalty to Sears/Whirlpool after getting really screwed by Sears.  Bought at Lowes, they delivered, installed, and took away the junk from Sears at no extra cost.  The 300 doesn't have the frills of more expensive machines, but has all the features you need to get your clothes clean.  \"Kids Clean\" cycle uses 150 degree water for tough jobs and sanitation.  The 300 series doesn't have 170 degree option if you really like your clothes cooked. If you like more bells and whistles, I understand another $500 could keep you happy.

A small amount of effort yields a great benefit to reducing the pod waste. The spent coffee is easy to collect for the garden this way too.",

    "text": "Dryer was making a super loud knocking sound. Found out on you tube that the wheels needed to be replaced.<br /><br />Dryer appliance repair technician quoted some astronomical price to replace the wheels in our dryer.<br /><br />Watched the videos on you tube and proceed on our own with these wheels. FYI these wheels do not come with the piece/shaft that goes thru the center.  So not sure why it is referred to as an &#34;assembly.&#34;<br /><br />However, for the rear wheels which is 2 of the four it is actually easier if one does not try to install new shafts and simply replaces the wheel on the existing shaft.<br /><br />However, a word to the wise. This is not rocket science but it is &#34;screw&#34; science. There were a boat load of screws.  So we used zip loc bags to collect each set of screws and labeled each bag to remind us what screws went where.<br /><br />In hindsight if we ever have to do it again we would also add a # to each bag. So the first set of screws would go in a zip loc bag labeled #1 with a written description plus take a corresponding picture with a smartphone in case by the time we got to bag #17 the description say for bag #3 was meaningless because of the obvious learning curve. Took 2 people, the newbie diy home tech and the screw tech assistant the better part of 2 days to complete the repair.<br /><br />But when we were done, the dryer worked beautifully like new, very quite.<br /><br />We only had 1 screw leftover when we were done. But hey! Saved a hefty cache of cash :-) And garnered some serious diy euphoria!<br /><br />Ready to build a city now!",

But as the ice maker kept working, the cubes got sturdier and I thought \"yeah, this is great!\" I made enough to fill my ice tray, not realizing that the bullets would freeze together since they come out of the maker with a lot of surface dampness.  No matter, I can break up the clumps pretty easily.  Unfortunately, the bullets melt very fast in any liquid, which means that unless you down your beverage quickly, you're going to end up with a cool, watered down drink.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: Convenient way to make extra ice, but nothing to rely on for a permanent solution.",

I've also recently begun making my own \"garden tea\" from flowers and herbs in my own yard. (Don't do this without first researching the safety of each plant and plant part! Some food plants have poisonous leaves, for example.)<br /><br />Advantages to making tea with an infuser:<br />* Infusing tea with an infuser is considerably less expensive than making similar quality tea from tea bags, and makes a better product because of superior flow.<br />* Blend tea yourself in your preferred varieties and proportions.<br />* Even make homemade herbal tea.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* The large size allows flow space.<br />* The large infuser fits in normal or large coffee mugs, or in a normal sized tea pot. The rim keeps it from falling in. Very versatile.<br />* Very easy to clean. If cleaned right away, it rinses clean.<br />* No metal parts to bend. It retains its shape well.<br />* No metal parts also means you won't burn your hands on it.<br />* The lid is an extra bonus; you can use it for putting the infuser on after you're finished steeping.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* It's a little tricky to wash if you let the tea leaves dry in it too long.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a phenomenal price for a product that holds up well and makes the best tea I've ever made.",

And then I found an old guy showing that you don't have to remove the complete back panel since it's flexible and you can leave the ice maker in place! (Pull out the ice maker drawer, however.) He used a tie wrap (I used a piece of yarn - cause that's what I had nearby and I'm just an 'old' lady, lol) and after you take out the bottom most 5 screws you flex the panel up and tie it through the screw hole to the ice maker bracket to get it out of your way.<br /><br />I turned off my circuit at the breaker box so I didn't even have to pull out the fridge from the wall to unplug it. Take ice make drawer out, remove the shelves and bottom basket, take 5 screws out and tie panel up to the ice maker bracket, remove motor, remove fan from old and put on new, put back in place, screw the back panel down, replace shelves and you're done. :) (Oh, and turn the breaker back on.)",

    "text": "Thanks to Amazon for carrying the Kenmore brand. Saved me a trip to Sears -- the store is not my favorite place to shop, and it's located in a mall where you need a bodyguard to walk safely from your car to the entrance.<br /><br />Fortunately I decided to replace one that was sitting in the storeroom in its original box, so as to have another on hand when needed. This made it easy to see that the product at Amazon is the same as the product I'd purchased some time back at Sears. It fits, it works, and I'm a happy camper.<br /><br />Recently, my Brita filter pitcher decided to grow a crop of stubborn algae. No amount of cleaning and disinfecting got rid of it. Our water isn't THAT bad, but it must be said that a pot of coffee made with our city water, straight from the tap, makes roadside diner coffee seem superb. In the absence of the Brita, I decided to try filling the pot with water out of the refrigerator filter. It WORKED. Next pot of coffee was delicious. So...I guess this particular filter used in that particular fridge is filtering most of the bad-tasting stuff out of the water.",

    "text": "It took a bit of trial and error, but, I got the machine working well. Instructions could have been a lot clearer.<br />Water is poured into a reservoir that holds about 1 1/2 liters.  The machine produces a \"rack\" of ice about every 15 minutes. Four cycles will fill the catch box holding the ice. This needs to be emptied after 20 minutes or so since the ice will begin to melt as if it were in a refrigerator. The melt drains off and recycles through the machine so it is not a problem if one doesn't mind smaller ice cubes; they are small to begin with.<br /><br />The machine works by water flowing from a horizontal tube with many very small holes that allow water to flow over the ice-making rack. It is obvious that the water put into the reservoir must be scrupulously clean. I currently use only filtered water. I think this is essential to prevent a breakdown.<br /><br />The size of the cubes does vary and can be adjusted. Some people put the fresh ice into bags before putting the ice in a freezer. This is helpful since the fresh ice will \"clot\" and need to be separated somewhat. I use a wood mallet for the purpose. If the ice is placed into a plastic bag just dropping it on a counter should work to separate the ice.<br /><br />The making of ice is quite noisy. If I am in the same room as the machine, it sounds like a truck going by.<br /><br />I am impressed so far. Fridgedaire put a lot of thought into the machine.  Cheaper versions of ice-makers have a high rate of negative reviews while Fridigaire has good reviews overall. You will pay for that— It's worth it.",

The mesh is so fine that even very powdery teas like Kusmi and others with ground spices in the blend are no problem. I find no sediment in my teapot when using this Finum basket. Despite the fine mesh, water flows through it easily and steeping performance is quite good. It's easy to hand clean and holds up in the dishwasher as well. The product is so well made and so superior to the more common perforated stainless products, there's really not much more to say. It's a huge upgrade over the infusers most teapots, even good ones, come with. Buy it, you'll be glad you did.",

These are very thin paper, and so do not affect the draining of the water out of the grinds. In my older version aluminum purcolators, it was a perfect fit! The first time I used the filter, I was afraid of clogging, and water running out the top - but it never happened. The coffee had no dregs whatsoever! The paper is biodegradible, so it can be composted with the coffe grinds if you use them for your garden or planting.<br />The flavor of the coffee was not affected. These are ighly recommended if you use a percolator, a fine grind, and like to drink it to the last drop. ☺",

It's the cap on top of the spring. The cap has a collar that fits rather tightly on the rod and slides up and down, but with some resistance. Apparently that resistance is what provides the damping and stops the slamming. When that collar loosens over time and the cap slides too easily, the slamming starts.<br /><br />I saw some innovative fixes. One was to use construction adhesive around the collar to increase the friction. Another was to put a small cable tie around the collar and cinch it tightly enough to increase it.<br /><br />Or you could just buy this set of replacement rods. This set works.

    "text": "We've had a Roper RTW4640YQ1 quite a long time. I keep fixing it instead of buying a new one. I think I've replaced the shift actuator three or four times, the main control board once, the transmission once (and incidentally the washer seemed to work better than it did new after I replaced it), and the main motor capacitor once.<br /><br />When the drum started slamming around on spin cycle, I decided to go ahead and buy a new washer. Since I was familiar with this model and know how to repair it, I ordered one like it. After the order was delayed a couple of times, I decided to cancel and once again fix the old one.<br /><br />I looked around on the Internet and discovered the suspension rods were the likely problem. After watching a couple of how-to videos, it looked like a pretty easy fix.<br /><br />I had a delay though because I ordered the wrong rods to start with.  The rods that fit our machine are part number W10780048, and are about 23 and 1/2 inches long. I found a listing for part number ERW10780048, and thought that must be a match since all but the first two letters were the same number. Nope. Those rods are about three inches longer and didn't fit. I returned them and ordered these correct size ones.<br /><br />The only glitch I encountered in installing them was the drum got snagged on the overlapping seam of the metal panel on the back as I was trying to lift one of the rear rods into its position. I didn't realize that was why I had to pull so hard to get it situated. I freed the drum from the seam and things went a lot more smoothly.<br /><br />Anyway I got them installed and it solved the problem. The machine is spin cycle-ing nicely again without slamming.<br /><br />[**UPDATE** -- After running several loads I've come to think the springs in these rods aren't quite as strong as the the ones on the original equipment rods. Some slamming does still occur with larger loads. It's still an improvement, but not quite up to \"as new\" performance.]<br /><br />[**UPDATE 2** -- I finally gave up and bought a more expensive set of replacement rods. Search for \"Whirlpool W10780048 Suspension, 24\", white.\" They work better.]<br /><br />One more repair I did while I had the machine out: One of the bottom front corners has gotten rusty, so I reinforced it by fastening blocks of pressure treated 2 x 4 on the inside by running screws through the sheet metal from the front and side. It doesn't look great, but it's sturdy.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, I did order those smaller springs to put at the top, but as other reviewers have said, they're not needed. They don't provide much tension, and on our machine there were only installation holes on three of the corners of the drum assembly. Besides, the washer did not come with them originally, and it worked fine without them for years. I gave them a look-over and decided to not bother with installing them.<br /><br />So just double-check your part numbers, and you might even want to go ahead and remove one of the rods before ordering so you can measure the length and make sure it matches up to what you're ordering.",

    "text": "I've seen some YouTube reviews on this and similar items. I live in an RV full time without a laundromat near by. So I purchased this to wash my clothes.<br /><br />The washer is a little noisy but if I shut my bathroom door, I don't hear it as much. When I first got it the back wasn't properly snapped into place but that was easily fixed.  The hose provided to fill the washer is useless, I just put my shower head into the tub.<br /><br />When I use this, I put about a tablespoon to 1.5 tablespoons of liquid laundry detergent for a large load with about half a scoop of oxi clean. I run my machine for 15 mins and then let it sit. I will drain the dirty water and rinse the tub a little bit. Then close the drain and fill with clean water and run for 15 more minutes. Then I will drain again. Pull half if the clothes and spin them for at max 4 mins. After the spin, they are damp but quickly dry.<br /><br />There are water levels for low, middle, and high water marks on the lint filter but they are hard to see. The lint filter is a nice way to catch loose thread but it doesn't filter all of the water.<br /><br />I store it behind my entertainment center and it fits really well there. The issue is getting into my bathroom. I have to go up a small set of stairs to the bathroom and it's a little bulky to easily get up there.  Because it has legs, I can have it in my shower when it's draining and not have to worry about the motor getting wet.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice machine. I can put 2 pairs of jeans and several shirts in a load. I have even fit my entire queen sized sheet set including pillow cases into it.",

I went back and forth between this item and [[ASIN:B00009V3TL Dundas Jafine UD48 Space Saver Aluminum Dryer Duct, Extends 28-Inch to 45-Inch]].  I wish I'd bought that one instead.<br /><br />Firstly, though the box was not damaged, there was a big dent in one half of housing...so someone packed it for shipping knowing it was damaged.<br /><br />Secondly, the collars are neither tapered or sized to overlap the collar to which you're connecting them, so you're not going to be able to slip them into or over either your standard outlet collar OR a standard expandable duct--unless you plan to use a roll of foil tape to butt the two together and hope for the best.  Also, because they are hard collars, you can't use a screw clamp to secure them, even if they DID fit.  I ended up cutting one of the collars off completely and used some high-temp hot glue to attach it to [[ASIN:B0028BAAWW Dryer Dock Vent Hose Quick Connect]], and the other I did the tape thing...for now.<br /><br />Also, even though the picture looks like the duct is slim and sturdy, it's not.  Imagine taking a regular thin-tin duct and smooshing it a bit to make it more oval.  That's what this is like--and it dents and becomes misshapen very easily.<br /><br />I'm going to order the other item now--do yourself a favor and avoid this one.",

I also forgot the hose the first time so water got everwhere.  They machine should not allow you to turn on without the hose being attached.  Other than that I love it",

Although I am diligent about emptying the lint trap after every load, dryer sheets can, and will clog up your lint screen (if when put under water, it beads up on the screen, then spray with hot water which will take the soap from the dryer sheet off). The pipe the air runs through picks up lint, they all do. They have to be cleaned. This tool was not hard to use. All of the rods were easy to screw together. I kept adding until i was at the end of the vent, then did a couple of feet, stopped, took 2 rods off, and repeated the process until the brush came back out at the bottom. The brush and vacuum attachment for the dryer itself was useful for cleaning the places I couldn't reach. Great buy and I feel safer knowing that I won't have any fires due to excess lint buildup between the dryer and the outside vent.",

They do filter out the grounds, but only allow for ONE cup at a time use – meaning, if you're brewing more than one – you have to clean it out.<br /><br />Filters – these do not have a “paper lid” (see the ones for the Perfect Pod system). This causes the grounds to STICK to the top of the cup, much like the grounds sticking to the sides of the provided cup.<br /><br />When using the filters with the cups – you get less coffee per “cup”. Without the filter? You have a HUGE mess to clean up.<br /><br />The only thing good was the scoop. I loved the adorable heart at the end.<br /><br />Honestly, I'd prefer using the Perfect Pod system as it definitely works, even with the Keurig machine I got back in 2011 (yes, over 10+ years ago).<br /><br />The cups are expensive, but I've been using mine since about that long.

But, not only does those K-Cups get expensive, but they're also not too good for the environment.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not a NO PLASTIC EVER kind of person. I'm not a tree hugger. I'm also not “hey let's create a boatload of waste” either. I do what I can, where I can, when I can to reduce my imprint.<br /><br />As a result, along with my Keurig, I purchased a reusable cup. At that time it was the “PERFECT POD” one, and I also got their filters. And, they were pretty affordable. Sometimes hard to find.<br /><br />I'm always on the lookout for a GREAT deal. Seeing these, I thought I would try them.<br /><br />One thing I should've noticed and didn't, and this is 100% on me, they don't have a “lid”. If you want to know what I mean, check out my pictures. The white filters are PERFECT POD, the unbleached ones are this product.<br /><br />Notice the white filter as a “lid”. This is quite useful when putting the ground in. Without the lid to cover them, they tend to fall out of the reusable cup whether the filter is FULL or not. This can lead to some grounds in the machine, your cup, and makes the top of the filter nasty to clean. The white filter with the lid prevents that entirely.<br /><br />These are not easy to store or take out of the package. ALL 600 FILTERS are in ONE bag. NO individual bags to take out and store the rest until needed. One has to open the WHOLE BOX, WHOLE BAG, to get one (1) filter. I decided to grab a “group” of filters and store them in another bag.<br /><br />Do these work? Aside from those issues, yes. There is no difference in the taste of the coffee. Then again I usually chill it then mix with chocolate milk for a mocha.<br /><br />Whether one wants to buy these depends on whether they want to clean the K-Cup EVERY SINGLE CUP (thankfully I do have two reusable cups), and do they want to open the box and bag for one (1) filter.<br /><br />Given the filter's design -1 star; packaging -1 star.<br /><br />While they're still a good value, my next group will either be my old brand or a cheaper brand with the lid. I honestly wouldn't get these again, and I don't recommend them.",

Also, the k-cup machine took up less space than my coffee maker and was much easier to clean and maintain.<br /><br />However, I would still end up with ground/bagged coffee as gifts, etc. I had no way to use them. Also, the plastic k-cups were getting to be a problem – storage and varieties among them.<br /><br />To ease both problems, I looked into a reusable k-cup and found the Perfect Pod system in 2012. The cup was perfect and the filters were easy to use, easy to store, and I could even use my bagged/ground coffees again.<br /><br />These work about the same way as the bigger coffee filters – you pop it in, fill it to the desired point (for strength), pop it in. When done (and cool) – you pop the plastic cup out and toss the tiny filter. That's a tad bit more environmentally friendly than the disposable ones. If properly maintained the main cup doesn't need to be cleaned.<br /><br />I've been a Perfect Pod customer since 2012 and still one today, and I'll likely be one into the future.

When I washed all the cups before trying them, I noticed 2 had sharp, jagged pieces of plastic on the top rims. Right where I pick the K Cup up to put it in the machine. Rather than risk pricking my finger when I'm half-asleep and making a cup of coffee, I just got rid of the 2 with jagged edges. 4 reusable cups is still a good value.<br /><br />I wish the package included instructions. I wasn't sure how much coffee to use the first time and had to look at the product page to find out. The cups use 2 tablespoons of coffee.<br /><br />The reusable cups worked in my Keurig. I like that they are easy to clean and I'm not throwing out as much plastic.",

    "text": "It runs fairly quickly, making ice inside of five minutes indoors in 80 degree weather (no air conditioning in the room it is in, but no direct sunlight either).  It runs reasonably quietly.  It will make a brief noise similar to a computer fan running at times.  It will make a clunking noise as the ice drops into the basket.  It will make a very loud beeping noise when the ice basket is filled or the water supply is empty.  I'd rather it simply light a light (it automatically stops anyway) and not be so disruptive.  This isn't something you want to leave running overnight anywhere you can hear it (not that it would make sense to do so, since it would just be making the same ice over and over and it would make more sense just to put the basket load in the freezer or start again the next day) and it's a little annoying for a movie night. That's the main reason it's losing a star.<br /><br />It doesn't keep the ice frozen.  That's not its intended function.  Instead it makes ice and then drops them in a basket above the water reservoir.  As the ice melts the water fills the reservoir, from which it is then pulled to make new ice.  You can have your choice of small or large cubes.<br /><br />It makes the kind of ice that has a hole in the middle, and not very thick walls even when set to large and that this gives the ice a lot of surface area, which means it melts very quickly. I would prefer the ice be a bit more solid, but a friend of mine thinks it's just fine if the ice is a bit &#34;melty&#34; so it's a matter of individual taste.<br /><br />It comes with a tiny ice scoop that would fill about half of a lowball glass with ice on a single scoop.  It's very cute and very convenient.<br /><br />It has two buttons, one for power, the other for choosing if you want small or large cubes.  It's about as easy to operate as a device can be.<br /><br />Overall, I think it will be a convenient device for entertaining in the summer.",

I ran the cleaning cycle and then made ice.  My machine seems to average 7 minutes per batch and then pops out 10 \"cubes\".  That is around 85/86 \"cubes\" per hour.  I ended up making ice while I was home.  I just baby sat the machine. I could hear the ice drop.  I then transferred it to a ziplock bag in our freezer.  However, aside from having a distinctive dropping noise, it is really quiet.<br /><br />I chose this because we do not have an ice maker.  I actually haven't had an ice maker in my life for several years. Ice cube trays just never worked for us in terms of space used in our freezer.  I am excited, now I can enjoy iced coffee and also ice bath our hard boiled eggs after cooking them.  It is the little things in life.<br /><br />This is pretty space efficient.  Not ugly.  Works well for its size.  Easy to use.  I am super happy to have it.  No complaints of regrets.",

That is no problem because all you do is gently tap it with your hand to remove most of the grounds, and then Swish and some soapy water for a few seconds. The reason I say this is because I have a similar one and noticed that for some reviewers, the cone separated from the base, although that did not happen with me. After using this model, I don't think that's an issue as it seems to be very secure.<br />Perhaps I'm being overly cautious by not putting it in the dishwasher, but it's so nice and convenient that it's worth a few extra seconds to clean it.<br /><br />If you are giving this as a gift, please know that it comes nicely packaged. After my friend got so excited, this would be a terrific part of a coffee gift basket for someone going off to college or getting their first apartment.<br />It's also a nice option for someone that doesn't drink coffee, but occasionally entertains people who want just a cup or two, because it doesn't take up much storage space and you don't have to worry about those filters.<br /><br />I received this product in order to test with the option to review.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:9bb528d767827637c2d4eba863317730]] If you need ice in a hurry, this machine is for you.<br /><br /> In under 10 minutes, you will have enough ice to fill your glass.<br />Operation could not be more simple. After un-boxing, let the machine sit for 30 minutes before turning it on. That's very important, because the refrigerant has to stabilize. And if you've had an ice maker before, you might forget the important step.<br /><br />Anyway, after a quick wash of the machine, all you do is fill it with water, select the size cube you want, and let the machine work its magic.<br />One thing about this, and any ice machine, is the importance of keeping it super clean. Even restaurant ice machines often have high levels of bacteria. You can avoid that by regularly wiping this machine clean. If you don't use it for a while, make sure that you dry it as well as you can, and leave the lid open in order to air dry even more.<br /><br />The cubes are bullet shaped and hollow. If you like to crunch ice, use the setting to make small cubes, or should I say, bullets.<br />Another nice feature about this machine is the long cord. When entertaining, I like to set up a table with beverages. The cord is long enough to go down the table and into the electrical outlet.<br />As the video shows, it doesn't make a lot of noise, and certainly will not interfere with a party where music is played and people are having fun.<br />My freezer is generally too full to store ice cubes, and it never fails. Whenever I make hard boiled eggs, they go from hot water to ice water, and of course I don't have any ice cubes. With this, while the eggs are coming to a boil, the machine makes enough ice to chill the eggs when they are done cooking.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've been using this ice machine everyday for almost a month. In the early evening, I start up the machine. Within 10 minutes, of course, I have enough ice for my glass, but then I keep the machine going and it fills up in a few hours. Now there is enough ice not only for the whole evening, but I unplug the machine and keep it filled with ice. In the morning, the ice is still there.<br />A bit melted, but there is enough insulation in this machine to keep a full load of ice until morning. For me, and perhaps for you, that is huge because I have no room in my freezer.<br /><br />As stated in my original review, the following is of the utmost importance. Every few days or so, in between the morning iced coffee and the evening start up, the water is emptied, and I use a very weak (one half teaspoon to a cup of water) vinegar solution and a lint free cloth to wipe the interior clean. Then the lid is left open to air dry. Always empty the water and do this if you don't plan on using it for a few days. You can turn the machine on its side to get every last bit of water out, if you like, but remember that 30 minute rule to let the refrigerant stabilize.  It sounds like a lot of maintaining but it isn't.<br />This machine is wonderful for ice-a-holics like me!<br />And I admit to being overly cautious.<br />DISCLOSURE: Product received at no cost or at a discount, with the option to review.<br />Views and opinions are my own.

The sampling rate and screen update are appropriate.<br /><br />Depending on your use, this monitor measures @PM2.5. It's an appropriate indoor green/yellow/red light monitor. @PM2.5 ≤ 12µ = green light. Yellow light between 13-35. >35? Deepening shades of red ... until you can't see color, then like-2000 years in the future, some kid will be digging a hole and strike a void, someone will pour plaster of Paris in the void and you'll live in fame, slain by flaming hot particles just like Pompeii. @PM2.5 the results are comparable to the Air Quality Index (AQI) as locally reported by NOAA.<br /><br />Relative humidity (RH%) is heuristically linked to PM2.5. The higher the RH%, the lower the PM2.5. The lower the RH%, the higher the PM2.5 reading. I've noticed that an interior RH% ≈ 50% displays 1-5 ppm.<br /><br />As a note to ‘bunny suit' people, PM2.5 is not the metric for comparisons to ISO cleanroom levels. This monitor might suggest 1-5 ppm, but, my living room is NOT class 10 ...  given rugs, etc, it can't be made to get to class 100,000.<br /><br />Twenty years ago, this sensor was a high-$ industrial proposition and hardly for home use. However, Acurite has packaged a bundle of technology here to deliver excellent value for money.<br /><br />Was my review helpful? If so, click \"Helpful\" so I can know.

Is it made of plastic? Is it actually made of a safe material? I just can't tell. They are saying anywhere what it is actually comprised of.<br /><br />The claim of dishwasher safe is kind of laughable. It picked up a lot of little food bits in the dishwasher, and I certainly wouldn't have even tried to clean it that way had they not made the claim. It is easy to rinse out under the faucet and there's really no need to dishwasher it.<br /><br />While I am primarily a tea drinker, I do occasionally have the need to steep coffee, so I tested this on both tea and coffee. For tea, it was extremely effective and would be great for travel when I might not have all of the accoutrements I normally keep with me for steeping the perfect cup of tea.<br /><br />However, for coffee, it let some of the finer bits through, yet somehow didn't really steep properly. It felt simultaneously watery and muddy. I'm not sure I'd recommend it for coffee, however it was so effective for tea that I do feel it's a good product.<br /><br />If you are traveling and need a tea or coffee maker that you can use in a pinch, this is a good product which folds down to almost nothing and is easy to clean.

You need to be able to put it somewhere that is a large surface to place it on, that is also by a 3 pronged outlet, plus be able to drain it somewhere (sink/bucket). I ended up running our first load while it was on top of my clothes dryer but cannot keep it there because it is blocking my laundry cabinet.<br />- if you don't keep it in a permanent spot you will have to pick it up and move it to use it and it's pretty heavy/bulky to do that.<br />- drain hose has a mind of its own.. I recommend giving it some time to straighten out and unravel because it kept wanted to go back to the shape it was stored and the suction cup was basically no help with that..<br /><br />Overall I'd say this is definitely convenient to have it's just a matter of figuring out if you have the correct space for it - and if you do it's a lovely and handy machine to have!",

    "text": "I was so excited to get this ice maker. I really thought it was going to be amazing especially for this price point. Don't get me wrong, this does exactly what the item description says it does. It makes wonderful ice and it really is just like Sonic's ice but there are some huge flaws. So, I am getting everything together to get this process going, First, this only came with a quick start guide. There is not a separate more thorough operations manual or any troubleshooting guide. Set up for me took a bit longer than it should have but having some unclear instructions was a distraction. You have to do a cleaning cycle before the ice. That was pretty easy just fill up the reservoir that is located under the ice bin to the fill line with water. Make sure the switch in the back is turned to cleaning and begin. Once that is done the extra water tank that is attached to the machine only by a magnet (which I do not like) has it's own cleaning cycle but it is not necessary to use the extra tank if you are not planning to make a lot of ice. Once the cleaning is done now it's ready to go. I started my first batch, made sure the ice was forming (it only took a couple of minutes) and went on with my day. I went back to the kitchen for a my first drink with my new ice about an hour and a half later. I see that there isn't any and there isn't any water either. I thought I must have done something wrong. So, I am scrambling around to find an answer to what us wrong. I went to the GE website and there isn't anything other than the quick start guide. Of course you can  contact support if there are any issues. I decided to start fresh so I took the plugs out of the hoses in the back and drained the water out which was trapped in the machine where I couldn't see it. I'm not sure about this but I had to have read it somewhere, I found out why there was no ice after I returned to the kitchen.  I knew the ice was forming and dropping into the bin before I left the kitchen so I know I wasn't crazy. But, this expensive appliance does not keep the ice in the bin frozen. What? The ice machine doesn't keep the ice frozen? So it only does half it's job and the bin is located inside the machine. I could understand if the bin was on the outside of the machine but the inside? So that is what happened it had all melted and the water was already recycling to make more ice. It just can't be seen. The guide states that if the water recycles it will make the ice taste bad. I really like this ice. The little pellets that form into ice make drinks taste so much better than the big bulky ice cubes do. This machine works great but I do not have time to babysit each cycle of the ice-making process. At least not at this price. To have an appliance this expensive do only half of what it should do is crazy to me. So, I wouldn't recommend this unless you gave a lot of cash to spend and a lot of time to waste but for me, this is unacceptable. I can not believe that this machine can make ice but it doesn't keep it frozen!",

My second issue is the replaceable filters. The little sponge ones are re-useable but the paper ones are not. I am thinking of fabricating one out of cheesecloth and see if that works.

This machine is lightweight; it can be moved and stored easily, and it cleans clothes better than my standard machine. The drawbacks are, for best results only run small loads, it won't accommodate huge items like king-size comforters or quilts, and it does not have a built-in lint trap collection system. However, there are some very inexpensive lint collectors (a couple of dollars) that you just toss in with each wash load that float around on the surface and collect amazing amounts of lint, so that problem is solved. Now that I have owned this machine, I doubt I will ever go back to a standard size (and weight) machine again; this is just too convenient and massively more affordable. ***111",

I do not like his personal items to be washed by the facility (I know just how filthy the bedding and things can get! I just don't want to use those items if I can help it.) So all of his rags, shirts, stuffies, braces, pillow covers,  pillows, ect.i prefer to wash. By first portable washer was a work horse! It finally broke down so I got on Amazon and bought this unit! The first wash was fine,  I really liked having the cycle button that allowed for swirling or vibration modes but this item is bigger than my old one and I had to bet a bigger bucket.  It also specified to suction to the side of the bucket instead of to the bottom but there are only a few auction cups and 2 of them wouldn't stick no matter what! So it would pop off the side and start spinning wildly in the bucket. So i switched to an old feed bucket that was flat on one side.  This worked a little better and load number two went perfectly! I was actually happy with my new larger load set up.  I then returned on another day to start load 3, NOTHING BUT GREEN FLASHY LIGHTS. Won't come on.  I tried everything.  It was dead! Now i have the hassle of returning it and ordering another.  But imma skip reordering this same unit.  Oh and the drawer to place the dertergent in........ useless...... yes it's a drawer but there are no holes anywhere inside or outside to release the dertergent.  Just 5 solid plastic walls inside.

Problem was that I bought filters from a discount store that were so short the grounds just floated right over the edge of the paper.<br /><br />Last ditch decision to try these out has changed everything. Coffee grinds stay on the inside of the filter and the coffee turns out perfect again since the sides are taller. I will be buying more of these in the future.<br /><br />Lesson learned.",

I keep this portable washer in my kitchen and use it frequently. It does a great job of washing, you can set different water levels, long wash or short wash, and I also use it to spin clothes that I've washed by hand. It's quiet and efficient and I'm totally happy with it.",

You can use your own coffee, filtering out the oils and getting maximum flavor, finish with the easiest cleanup for ANY of the K-cup-based systems while NOT polluting the environment in any way at all. I have literally tried every single alternative system there is for the K-cup brewer, and this is the best...hands down.<br />Besides being sooooo easy to set up and use for everyone in the family, I love that this system allows me to pre-fill cups and keep them in my K-cup carousel. For us, it's ease of use - We use them so quickly that there's no time for the coffee to get &#34;stale&#34;, so that's not the issue, but if the cups did hang around a little longer, the coffee is, in fact, protected enough to stay fresh for a couple of days.<br />So, we are in heaven - we use our own freshly-ground coffee and get fabulous results with wonderfully easy cleanup that is environmentally-friendly. Can't get better than that!",

It is super annoying to have to play with the paper filter cup and the \"self-tamping\" mechanism makes it impossible for me to easily put the desired amount of coffee into the cup. As a result, I have not been able to get a satisfactory cup of coffee out of it.<br /><br />This is way more effort than filling the Keurig K-Cup reusable filter and I get a far better cup of coffee from the Keurig product.<br /><br />Taking the time to play with this EZ-Cup is absolutely not worthwhile to me. Also, once you buy the reusable K-Cup system, there is no further money outlay, whereas with this EZ-Cup, you always have to buy their custom filter cups - at 10 cents each, that is way too expensive!<br /><br />Tip for the Keurig reusable system: get a \"Knock Box\" and keep it on your counter. It's what used by baristas - you knock the used filter on the bar of the bax and it dumps the used grounds into the box. You can then transfer them to compost or garbage. Makes it a lot less messy and streamlines the process for making the \"next cup\". I have this one: [[ASIN:B0010KZCDE European Gift and Houseware 60 Stainless Steel Knock Box]], but there are other styles to choose from.",

The coop temp has been very consistent and gives me peace of mind.<br />The floor of the coop is colder so the chickens are still acclimated to below freezing temps, but they get to rest and sleep above freezing which puts less stress in them.<br /><br />The set up was a little confusing, it helped to read the reviews here to understand what PV, SV, etc meant.<br />Basically, set the temp for the highest you want it to go which is where you will want the heat to turn off.<br />Then set the differential to the number of degrees you want the heat to kick on: I set mine at 35 a the max heat I want and where the electricity will kick off. I set the differential at 2, which is 2 degrees less than my max heat of 35.  This means the electric will turn on when the coop is at at 33 degrees, and will cut off when the coop temp reaches 35 degrees.<br /><br />I am very happy with this unit.",

You can wash and spin at the same time, I wash whites first then spin them then I do towels in that same wash water and spin those I set them aside and then drain it and refill for washing darks then spin those, then drain it and refill for the rinse, I rinse whites, then towels then the darks and as I'm rinsing a load I'm spinning another and then hanging them inside for now (its raining) but they are spun out just as good if not better then a regular size washing machine!!!

I had originally saved some of the smaller sized cartons and just kept refilling those as needed to keep some of the eggs easy-access, but now I don't have to do that.  I did have to put a grippy shelf liner underneath it to prevent it from sliding around on my refrigerator shelf, but that's not a big deal at all.  With this thing I can take the drawers completely out to restock them, one drawer per layer of the big box of eggs, and then slide the full drawer back into place.  It gets the big box completely out of the way and makes all of the eggs very easily accessible whenever we need them.  If we need a lot at once we can just pull an entire drawer and take it where we need it, then slide it back into place when we're done.  It keeps everything nice, neat, and perfectly accessible.  I really wish I had given in and bought this thing much sooner because I truly love it and the difference it has made for us in our kitchen.",

I thought for sure I was going to have to go to a laundromat for several months, something I was dreading.  Then I came to Amazon, and sure enough...someone had invented this neat little washer/dryer!!  This little thing is amazing!  I set it in my walk-in shower, plug it in, fill it up with dirty clothes (it holds more than you would think!), fill it up with water by using the shower hose (the hose that it came with didn't fit my faucet...but no big deal), pour laundry soap in.  I wash for the full time (15 minutes).  Drain...which is oddly satisfying to watch the dirty water come out.  Then fill back up with water and fabric softener...run about a 3-minute cycle, then drain.  You can't fit the same amount into the 'spinner', so it takes a couple of loads to spin the clothes.  I only spin them for about 2 minutes, and they are surprisingly quite dry.  Then I hang everything on a clothes dryer rack.  I've been able to do a load of wash almost every evening, and it's working like a charm!  I might just keep using this even when I finally get my new laundry room!",

The fact that it fits perfectly in my split sink makes the issue of filling, draining and protecting it in the spin mode just about perfect. It washes like a champ. I think it's better than my commercial-size washer I use for my clothes! I bought this because I have a dog that can't hold her bladder overnight so I put her in cloth dog diapers that of course need to be washed, and  I do not like to wash them in my regular washer, So this was the perfect solution! It agitates really well and as long as I don't overdo it with the detergent, I wash it, drain it, do a Rinse cycle, drain that, wring them Out by hand, and put in the spinner basket and run a spin cycle or two. The reason I say it's NEARLY perfect is because the spin cycle isnt that great. It does get some water out, but it's not fast enough to really help the drying process much. No biggie, though, because I just hang to dry in my garage. Easy peasy. Bottom line, for the $, this is an excellent little washer for baby clothes, dog diapers, or delicate items. So glad I purchased this!",

The instructions are very clear for cleaning and operating and the machine itself is very easy to operate.  The ability to hook this one up to any water filtration system is what sets this one above and beyond the others we have tried.

I just fill the water container with our water from our reverse osmosis system so it's super affordable for us too.

    "text": "We already had another nugget ice maker, but by an unknown brand and it works fantastic however, when we saw this one become available by a name brand I have trusted since I was a kid, I wanted to give them a fair shot.  Make not mistake though, when you order a nugget ice maker, most of them are quite large so keep that in mind when ordering because if you do not have the space for it, best to wait until you do.  That also means clearance space around the unit as these ice makers need plenty of ventilation for the fan to work properly and not burn out your motor.  This ice maker in particularly is fantastic!  It produces ice really fast, easy to set up, instructions are very clear and complete (unlike our last one, that was the only downfall to the other one), this machine is worth every last penny.  We haven't had it long, but so far it is fantastic- 44 lbs of ice in a day and it takes only about 30 minutes to fill up the bin entirely.  The different compartments is very interesting, something we are not used to with any of our other units, but I actually prefer the way Frigidaire decided to construct it this way.  In other brands, usually your ice basket hovers above the water, in this one, there are two separate compartments, with the water container being on top and you just slide it open, lift the little lid and fill.  The reason I like this feature better is because often, if your ice basket is sitting on top of the water, and someone accidentally puts just a little too much water in the reservoir, it melts the ice you just made.  With this unit, that is not even a thing.  I would definitely recommend this ice maker if you are wanting a nugget maker and I am truly glad these are finally becoming more affordable for home use!

I am happy to report that this range hood does an incredible job at suction, it's quiet even on the highest fan setting.  The LED lights are not blinding but they provide the perfect amount of light for me.  I love the touch buttons rather than the knobs, much easy to control.  We needed a replacement/updated range hood badly.  Ours was so bad that instead of exhausting like it was supposed to, it would just blow the smoke out everywhere in the house instead of up and out.  It was definitely time for an upgrade either way.  And the price is really reasonable for something this nice that works perfectly.  I highly recommend this one, zero issues so far and we have had it for 3 months going on strong.  I will update with pictures once I can locate the pictures I took.  Hope this review is helpful!",

Surprisingly, out of the box the craftsmanship was great and had easy to follow, clear instructions for installation and with just a few modifications to our cabinetry, it fit great.  We over-estimated it fitting into our space so it wasn't quite big enough, only short by like an inch and a half, so that is where the modification to our cabinet came into play, we didn't have to modify the range hood at all.  Once installed we were really impressed with the subtle fan noise on both speeds.  The LED lights were also not overwhelmingly bright, they were quite perfect for the space over the oven.  For this price point, I can highly recommend this range hood for a replacement or an upgrade.  Hope this review is helpful!!",

Frustrated with the effort required to clean the press and the realization that even when it's clean it isn't quite as clean as I'd like, I decide I'd go even simpler and give this Ready Set Joe a try. I usually have two or more cups in the morning so I use an oversized filter heat up about 18-20 oz of water ,put Ready Set Joe over a container of equal size throw my desired amount of coffee in.. Slowly pour the hot water over the grounds...(running a few splashes of water to wet the filter prior improves the speed that the brewing coffee flows through).  I like this drip method very much and don't miss the daily hassle of cleaning out the coffee press. Tastes great. I am going to buy one to travel with. I like the red color it is easy to spot!

The newer one actually fits in the black holder better for it, but of course, activated carbon is expensive, and cutting 15% of it out is going to make a reseller happy.

All Freezer settings are the same, no changes made when I installed the new Ice Maker. Not sure why, am sure someone will suggest that the unit has to get to operating temp in order to start making ice at a faster pace. Funny, when I had removed and reinstalled the original Ice maker it would make the fist batch of Ice in 4 hrs and fill up the bin with Ice 14-16 hrs later. This unit has only produced 1/3 of the bin worth of Ice in a 16 hr time span.<br /><br />The Teflon coating is not Black, like pictured, more like a Tan color similar to the OEM Ice Maker. For now I am happy that I am not drinking chips of Teflon from the old maker. Hope this unit works for more than a year and does not peel up.",

First thing you will need to do is open the back of the dryer, with it unplugged, and check the Thermal Fuse.

    "text": "We have a relatively new GE refrigerator:  we moved into our current home in August 2012, and our refrigerator was new at that time, so it is less than three years old.  We had a GE model in our old home as well, and although that one was over 12 years old, the drip tray was in perfect condition.  Unfortunately, the drip tray on our current model (GSCS3PGXSS) was much more poorly made, being cheap plastic that was coated to appear a faux stainless to match the refrigerator.  In the brief time we have owned this new refrigerator, the coating has chipped away, exposing black plastic underneath.  Even worse, this problem has allowed bacteria to form, as we have been unable to adequately clean and sanitize the tray.<br /><br />My husband began searching for a replacement.  On the manufacturer's web site, they were charging over SIXTY dollars for this replacement part (not including shipping).  As much as this problem was an issue for us, there was NO WAY we were going to pay that amount.  Luckily, after further research, my husband found that this replacement part appeared to be the right size for our refrigerator.  This was somewhat difficult to determine for several reasons.  First, plugging our model number into Amazon search feature at the top of the item listing did not work; it just said &#34;model not found.&#34;  Second, Amazon lists the WRONG dimensions for this item.  The dimensions Amazon has listed are the SHIPPING dimensions; the actual item dimensions are approximately 7.5&#34; wide and 4&#34; deep.<br /><br />A final concern was that this drip tray was black, not faux stainless steel like the original that came with our refrigerator as well as the refrigerator itself.  We thought that this would probably be fine, and you can see from the photo that I included that we were absolutely right!  The black tray actually looks BETTER than the original, as it provides a nice contrast with the refrigerator and matches the digital display.  This drip tray also seems better made, and we feel confident that it will last longer than the other.  And finally, we paid less than ten dollars!  We are only sorry we waited this long to replace the old tray.",
