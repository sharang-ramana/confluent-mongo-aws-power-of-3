I already own the Cusinart brewer for up to 10 cups and will probably stick with that even thought it is more effort to brew than a press button and go brewer.",

Wanted a nugget ice maker for our new wet bar and was all set to buy the GE Opal but was concerned about all the lukewarm reviews given its hefty price tag. After reading reviews for every competitive offering on Amazon decided to get the Crownful and so glad I did. Works great - love the easy access tilt up door and removable basket. Also love that you pour additional water right into same compartment instead of messing with removable tank (like our keurig has). If you zoom in on the photos and compare to the Opal they make identical ice. And this thing makes LOTS of it. Started producing in about 20 minutes and even with me scooping it up as fast as it could make it to put in a couple of mixed drinks it filled its basket in no time and has had no trouble keeping up since. The ice storage must be well insulated because even overnight there's still plenty of unmelted ice the next morning. I think what pushed me to pull the trigger on this one was several reviews from people who'd gone through 2 or 3 Opals in a very short period of time. I'm thinking you could buy 2 of these for what the Opal costs and literally have a spare. Oh and here's what else my research revealed: this and the Opal are the only 2 nugget ice makers Amazon sells an extended warranty on but it was $90 on the Opal and $12 on this one - that's a no brainer. But it gets better - if you register it with the manufacturer they upgrade the first year limited warranty to a one year replacement warranty. Buy this! You won't be disappointed.",

And you have to buy almost $50 worth every time to get free shipping. Shipping is about as much a a sleeve of pods,  nespresso knows what there doing when trying to get you to buy as much as possible. I love cafe bustelo and this stainless steel pod works perfectly every time! You don't have to just use espresso grounds either. My wife uses normal ground coffee you usually buy in a store and it works great and still froths the coffee. Before we got this we honestly stopped using the nespresso for a little and  started looking into buying a espresso machine but this fixed that! I would definitely recommend using this. Feels very durable and I believe this will last a long time. I've had mine for about 3 months now and no issues.",

It's not a gentle motion, and the blades really grab and manhandle your clothes.<br /><br />That might sound good but it destroyed many of my older dress shirts and older wool delicates. And it stretched out some items permanently - like many of my cotton socks are longer now and it stretched my cotton T shirts and boxers out of shape.<br /><br />The delicate cycle is not delicate at all and washes the clothes in the same manner, just a shorter duration.<br /><br />If you put too many long sleeve shirts or pants together it twists them into tight ropes which then get tangled up w each other like pretzels. Then imagine the tight ropes being turned violently in one direction then the other. I can see the seams on some of my almost new pants coming apart. It might work fine for very tough fabrics but that's about it.<br /><br />Also the “normal” mode is completely wacky and is the least normal mode. It doesn't use enough water for the wash and it does a final spin cycle for 86 minutes! That's right 86 minutes!<br /><br />I don't know who programmed this thing. It is the same Chinese washers sold under other brand names just rebranded with the Black and Decker name.<br /><br />It could be a good machine if it were programmed properly/more intelligently and not so rough on your clothes.",

This results in premature wear of your  clothing. Thin T-shirts I had, had their necks stretched out. and delicate thin wool clothing had holes and tears created in them. Basically if you have any delicate or thin fabrics, they may get damaged, and even if they are not delicate, they will wear a lot faster or get stretched out more than if you washed it in a front load machine.  I am not saying it is much worse than the other portable top load machines here with similar agitator designs. They all probably do the same thing.",

    "text": "I am regretting that I bought this Bosch B26FT70 French door refrigerator with bottom freezer from a non-amazon.com seller (appliancesconnection.com).  This expensive appliance started making a loud humming noise intermittently, within 1 week after installation.  When I called the warranty service the tech takes a whole 8 days to arrive just to tell me that he cannot hear anything wrong with the fridge and leaves.  Called back for warranty service and was told that a specialist would look at it.  Meanwhile the steel trim on the large shelve came off due to shoddy manufacturing.<br />By now it is almost another week later and the specialist comes in and validates that the evaporator motor is defective.  He is going to order the part and put it in when it arrives.  And he said that the shelf has to be replaced because of the trim problem.<br />This whole experience tells me that Bosch is just resting on its laurels.  Their product is simply shoddy with multiple problems.  Bosch's service is slow and unresponsive.  They should not be expecting a customer of a premium appliance, specially a refrigerator that is so essential for today's household, to wait for weeks for warranty repairs on a brand new appliance.<br />I will update this and let you know how long it finally took to get these issues resolved.<br />My advice is to AVOID, AVOID, AVOID this shoddy product.  My old inexpensive GE worked better for years, just threw it out only because we wanted matching appliances.<br /><br />Update on Feb 18, 2013,<br />*********************<br />The saga continues, as per my previous review, this refrigerator started failing almost from the get-go.<br /><br />After numerous problems with loud rattles and falling off trim continued, now the fridge stopped cooling and is completely dead. I used to be a fan of Bosch, but I honestly cannot recommend this \"top of the line\" fridge to even my worst enemy.<br /><br />Bosch's service is another story, this fridge spoiled my food thrice due to misdiagnosis and refusal to take care of the issue. The fridge is currently non-operational for over a week. It takes several days for Bosch's service reps to even come and misdiagnose the issue. These so called experts have repeatedly misdiagnosed the problems. At this point I have an expensive boat anchor in my kitchen.<br /><br />Feel free to buy it if you can afford to live without your primary fridge for weeks at a time.

This expensive mistake stopped working again.  Our first clue to a problem was the big puddle of water in the refrigerator trays and shelves.  The puddles were from the melting ice from the ice maker.  We soon realized that the refrigerator is not cooling and not operational.  Another $150 of spilt food, thanks to Bosch!<br /> Called Bosch service again and went through the rigmarole of providing a dated receipt for the 3rd time -based on the number of times I had to call Bosch, I think they should know me and my fridge on a first name basis by now!<br />The Bosch agent gave the contact information of local Bosch authorized service companies.  Frankly I am dreading this call to the local service companies based on my previous experience with these guys.  In my opinion the technicians are incompetent and unprofessional since it takes them multiple attempts to identify the real problem all the while I am sitting without a fridge and forced to pay high bills for restaurant food.  Also, in my previous attempt to repair the fridge, the tech neglected to order the necessary part making us sit with this boat anchor for an additional few days.<br />During my previous repair incident in Feb 2013, I asked Bosch to replace or refund the cost of the fridge since.  Bosch was very unsympathetic to my request.  Today,  I have requested Bosch to replace my dead fridge again and I am waiting to hear from them.  Question for the consumer lawyers amongst you:  I feel cheated by Bosch, what are my options, legal and otherwise?<br /><br />Update on June 15, 2013<br />************************<br /><br />Week 2 and the fridge still not fixed. Bosch does not even bother!",

DOUBLE CHECK!  Lastly, are these excellent desirable additional features;  hot water/brewing options for hot and Xhot (steaming hot) water, 4-12 cup water output, an included capsule for making coffee with your own preferred ground coffee, a cleaning mode, an on/off timer, reminders to fill the water reservoir, and when to clean the machine.<br /><br />I have not been disappointed with any of the cups of coffee this machine has made from the purchased coffee capsules or the capsules I made from my own ground coffee.  I have also made tea from capsules and they were also very good. I tested making a bowl of instant oatmeal with the Xhot water and it worked great.",

All in all I don't think it was the one for my maker but the coffee taste so much better using this one compared to the cheap plastic sprayer that came with the maker. If you want really strong coffee use less water and use 2 scoops for the measuring of less then a full pot as the grounds go over the filter if more then 2 scoops of grounds are put in.  It  does read 6 holes. I am not sure how many holes the original had as somehow it disappeared probably into garbage by way of used grounds. I read reviews at Walmart and that falling off seems to be the norm with the plastic sprayer.  The co. replaced it to the commenter's  supposedly for no charge but it was the same cheap sprayer.

    "text": "So the nespresso pods have a flange that sticks out, ensuring you can only enter it into your machine in one direction, right?  I bought one brand of refillable pod that includes that flange in the pop-off lid, and wouldn't you know--eventually the lid popped off and then I couldn't get the main body of the pod (which does not have a flange for the piston to push against) out of the piston.  It took a lot of maneuvering but eventually I was able to get my thumb in the pod and press hard enough against the side of it to get some purchase and pull it out, but I have to say I was afraid I had ruined my machine for about 30 minutes.  Luckily I was within the 30-day Amazon return window and was able to send the pod back.  So next I decided to try this one since the flange is built into the body of the pod (yay!).<br /><br />I have not been disappointed, although I have to say I think the stick-on seals are not necessary and I will not be buying them when I run out of the ones that came with the pair of pods.  They seem to come unstuck sometimes (apparently when I overfill the pod), so, inspired by an instructable for reusing the aluminum Nespresso pods (which I don't think is a really good idea because they have holes poked in the bottom of them and are a soft aluminum), I make my own foil lids by cutting out 1-3/4&#34; to 2&#34; circles from chocolate bar foil (such as Green & Blacks, or Trader Joe's dark chocolate--regular kitchen foil would be too thick), and find it makes a better shot of espresso.  You just have to make sure the silicone ring is not covered by the foil--use a fingernail to crimp it back into the groove near the edge after covering the top of the seal pod.  Also make sure your chocolate bar foil is not too wrinkled because it may have holes in it that could affect the way pressure builds up inside the pod (you can hold it up to the light to make sure it doesn't have too many).",

Apparently, so does Keurig as one of the reusables comes with their new machines.<br /><br />Advantages to these My K-cups are:<br />—you can use your own, favorite ground coffee, or grind your own. Fill the My K-cup, put it in the Keurig machine and get a cup of coffee made with your own grounds.<br />—you throw out the grounds only and this means you're not adding plastic pods to landfills.<br />—these things are sturdy and durable.<br /><br />This is a second one I bought, because you need to let the used grounds cool before disposal and cleaning. Now I can make two cups without waiting for the first one to cool. If you've got a newer Kuerig use this pod. You'll get great coffee (your own) and it's less expensive to buy grounds or beans than the disposable pods.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: This unit does not work with all models (older ones), so check compatibility before ordering.",

That knowledge nugget is among the many things I don't expect anyone under 30 to comprehend, along with knowing where Australia is on a map.<br /><br />If you need carbon paper and lots of it, this is the stuff to buy. The sheets are large and there are loads of them (actually 50). I won't need carbon paper, err, graphite paper for a long time.",

    "title": "Good Quality—You'll Need Several Add-ons To Install",
    "text": "An absolute nightmare to install.<br /><br />Thing is, you need some additional items to install this hood (Broan 423001) and this list is neither included in the Product Description, nor the From the Manufacturer notes just below the description. However very near the bottom, beyond the point of being tired reading that stuff are the words, &#34;BP87 dampers sold separately.&#34; Yes, it is AND YOU WILL NEED IT.<br /><br />The List of What Need/Must Have To Install:<br />1-BP87 damper<br />1- 7&#34; to 5&#34; reducer as 5&#34; is likely the diameter of your ducting (DO CHECK THE DIAMETER OF YOUR DUCTING). If you don't use this, return it.<br />1-Roll high temperature flue tape. The smallest roll I found was 5 yds long by about 2&#34; wide. It is NOT DUCT TAPE.<br />The cost of these items ran about $40 more than the cost of the hood, so plan this into your cost of installing. If you don't have the correct tools such as the short list below, add still another $40 to the total cost. I got my range hood when the price dropped to around forty bucks, and with all the extras, my end cost came to just over $85.<br /><br />As for tools, you'll need at least and hopefully you've got these already:<br />**Set of open-end wrenches (spanners for you Brits)<br />**3 or 4 electrical nuts to connect the fan and light wiring. Remember to GROUND THIS HOOD as spark in a grease flue can cause a fire. (most all range hoods collect grease in the filter and inside the ducting).<br />**Various smallish flat- and philips-head screw drivers<br />**A good, bright flashlight (torch for you Brits)<br />**Some electrical tape as you may need it. Wish I could be more specific about that.<br />**A great deal of patience<br /><br />Some final thoughts—<br />Get the space where the ducting runs open and accessible BEFORE starting.<br />SHUT DOWN YOUR COMPUTERS AND PRINTERS then you can TURN OFF THE BREAKER supplying power to your present range hood. Household wiring is, at times, illogical and the power for the range hood could be on the same circuit as the home electronics. So shutting down your computers is a safety step to protect them from the power surge when you turn the power back on.<br /><br />If the manufacturer had listed these add-on or gather together list, it would have saved me a couple hours frustration while driving around looking for the Need/Must Have stuff, it would have been much appreciated. The list under discussion is printed inside the manual that ships with the unit and while that's okay, I'd have preferred to be doing all the purchasing of these items so I could have been installing when the package arrived.<br /><br />Quality:<br />This range hood is made with what seems to be high quality material. The finish is even on all the surfaces. Dimensions are correct and as described. The front panel switches have a solid, quality feel when turned on and off. I rated the item 3-stars for not making the list of necessary additional items clear and complete in the Notes From The Manufacturer on the page with the item's listing.",

At that time I liked it very much. Over the months, it has clogged to the point where water runs through the coffee and into the Chemex so slowly as to render it useless. I've washed it carefully by hand as well as in the dishwasher and nothing seems to return it to its original, free-flowing self.<br /><br />I've gone back to buying the paper filters for my Chemex and these, one-time use filters work just fine and give me a pot of coffee that doesn't have to be reheated due to the slowness of this metal filter. Recommend you do the same. Yes, I'll keep this around in case I run out of the paper filters and no, won't use it as primary any longer.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.",

They stop answering their phone an hour before they are supposed to close and despite waiting 5 days and us having *TWO* conversations with them to confirm our scheduled appointment on the day prior to the appointment, they didn't show up! We did not purchase the item through Amazon, but it did however come from a very well known large orange box who despite numerous contacts and assurances they would assist, ultimately admitted they had no control over their service providers, then when we expressed our displeasure with that response, told us to bring the washer/dryer back, get a store credit, and buy replacements somewhere else.

All three have driven me a little nuts - they have taken so long to drip through, they get clogged, and by the time you finally get your cup, it's lukewarm.  I was initially drawn to this one because it has my initials on it (LHS) but then I saw that it was one layer of mesh instead of the usual two.  What a difference!  Coffee almost instantly, no clogs, hot coffee, and much easier to clean than the others.  Yes there are a few grounds in the bottom of my cup but I solved that problem by not drinking it to the last drop - who cares what Maxwell said?  Don't forget to put in about 3 tbl of hot water first to bloom the coffee.  Then add the rest, making small circles.  It produces delicious, hot, strong coffee (I add 3 level tbl of coffee).  From a devoted coffee connosieur - get it!",

I had the plastic pods prior to and hated them. However, I'm tired of throwing plastic pods out. What a waste and I do not find it. Pod coffee is as good as ground.

However, this product's wiring is aluminum. DO NOT simply solder or connect aluminum to copper. They have different heating temperatures and if your fan is in a bathroom, moisture will corrode the wiring.<br /><br />I'm not an electrician fyi. But after some research, you need to buy copper to aluminum connections. There's only a couple proprietary brands that are reliable but a quick search will show you the purple connection cones that work. (Thanks for the info Eric).<br />Oh, and one more thing, I had to reverse the engine rotation, it's easy, remove the nuts and bolts holding the shaft's bearings in position and reverse it once it has been removed, your fan should be spinning clockwise looking at it from behind the motor. I hope this one lasts 30+ years like the last one.",

I know it's because the machine spent a very humid east coast summer inside my very small bathroom, but I would like to know if I can buy a replacement hose.<br /><br />The ONLY thing wrong with this machine are the instructions, but once you figure it out, this is a great thing to have! Also, the seller got back to me right away to address all of my questions which made things much easier. After some trial and error, AND some reading online, I learned that the machine has to be higher than or level to the drain hose. So now I place the machine inside my tub on a plastic mat with the drain hose directed toward the tub drain. I also roll up the mat just a bit on the side closest to the drain, so that water doesn't get under the machine. It took me a few tries before I got the soap amount and rinsing down, because you have to use VERY little soap. You should also rinse out and wipe down the washing machine side with water and a cloth before running it again for a rinse cycle or you'll keep seeing suds. I bought this machine because I live in a New York City apartment without a laundry facility, and since the Coronavirus situation, I've had to use terry cloth rags to wipe down my dogs' paws each and every time we come in from outside. (2 dogs, 8 paws, 3 times a day!). Now, rather than have the rags piling up and then sending them (and paying a fortune) to be laundered, I just wash them in my bathroom, hang them on a rack by my window, and they're completely dry in just a few hours. I've also used this machine to wash t-shirts, underwear and lounge pants, and everything gets clean and dries realtively quickly.",

The only thing I would complain about here is the price which is nearly twice what I'd pay to go to Winn-Dixie and just pick up a box. Sometimes they're out of #2's though as they're popular. I was going to reluctantly pay for this rather pricey item but my bank found the same item for nearly one half the cost, so, much as I love shopping at Amazon, and I do a LOT, I passed on this. (Psst. Bring the price to a more reasonable $4 or $4.50 and you'll sell a lot more!) and bought from the other site. That said, if you want a great filter and you KNOW how to use them (follow directions and you can't go wrong), you'll get a fantastic cup of coffee. If you have the money to spare (I don't trust me) then go ahead and get these. The naysayers either didn't follow directions or they didn't realize that for smaller coffee makers you get the #1. As stated, I've been using them for well over 20 years of coffee drinking by now and have as yet to have ONE filter tear or break, I have no complaints with this brand--in fact, I consider them by FAR the best you can get.",

After installing we discovered our washer had a lot more issues than we realized and had to replace the washer anyway, but the three loads I got out of it after installing these parts were MUCH quieter than before. I think we waited too long to repair our washer as the basket was cracked all the way around the neck where it attaches to the spindle for the agitator. Not the fault of these parts.

I found this PN DC96-0082C and figured what the heck... for around $20 I could order the part with the belt and give it a shot myself.

It outpaces my other under-counter bar ice maker; of a well known name, and the noise level is about half that of the under-counter bar ice maker. Ice melt recycles if you do not empty the bin. Which my under-counter model just wastes. It will automatically stop when the bin is full. One word of caution. This goes for every \"bar ice type\" maker. Do NOT put the ice into your freezer.

But buyer beware I filled this with water and it has a little tiny Mister that comes out of the center for your humidity humidifier and oh so much water leaked out the bottom all across my wooden nightstand!!!!<br />Don't make something that's meant to hold water but you don't seal in waterproof the container that holds the water!!<br />I'm not sure where it was coming out from but could be from the screws that are in the bottom or the seal around the two pieces so I bought myself a $30 desk fan we'll see how long that lasts!!!",

This product is NOT compatible with this machine. It fits in fine, however it does not create a proper seal Im guessing due to the shape and half of my cup leaks out into the bottom catch bin.  I only became aware of this after making a cup without the catch bin and seeing half brew into the cup and half onto my counter from where it should be sealed while brewing. Ive had these pods for a few weeks and I wondered why my catch bin was always overflowing but now I know why. The cup seems to be too short for this model of nespresso. My machine brews just fine with the non reusable espresso pods. Pretty expensive 2 pods to not be able to use with my machine. Instead of saving money I've only wasted more on a product that said it was compatible and tested which my experience is not that.",

The local power company hauled away the old fridge with a rebate, yay, and the local store delivered.  The biggest negative is the limited freezer space since there is no way to move freezer drawers/shelves to increase volume.  Long-term freezer storage for bulk items won't work with this but I'm adapting.  The biggest positive is the incredibly useful tall refrigerator space in a footprint that fits an old kitchen, counter depth and unobtrusive.  Check your measurements.  The fridge I replaced stuck out a good 4&#34; into the galley kitchen while this one, much taller, sits even with the counters so the kitchen work space is quite a bit larger.  The unit is not silent but when the compressor is off it is noiseless, and the furnace drowns it out regardless.  I'm very happy with this purchase.",

The temperature control is on the back of the refrigerator so if it is installed under a countertop you have to pull the refrigerator out to adjust the temperature. Pretty stupid. Also, there is no way to turn it off without unplugging it, so see previous problem re pulling it out from under a counter. The bottom of the refrigerator is poorly designed: it has only one adjustable foot for balancing and does not balance well at all. It has structural components underneath that make it difficult to stabilize it by putting support under it, such as a piece of wood. Finally, in order to get the right and left sides of the door positioned equidistant from and parallel with the cabinets on the right and left, the main body of the refrigerator has to be inserted crooked into the space between the cabinets, otherwise the door protrudes more on the handle side out from under the cabinet than it does on the hinge side. I spent well over an hour trying to get it balanced and squared up with the cabinets around it. Finally succeeded only by placing shims on the sides of the refrigerator, which could only do because the countertop is not yet installed over it. I suppose if it was free-standing and on a hard floor it would probably be fine.",

    "text": "REVISED REVIEW:  First BIG PRO.  I have had this unit for over a year now and it is still going strong.  This unit makes one incredible cup of coffee.  Like the best cup of coffee, I've ever had from one of these single-cup units.  THIS UNIT DOES ONE JOB - MAKE A GEAT CUP OF COFFEE, AND IT DOES IT VERY, VERY WELL.  The unit also has a lot of desirable features:  It has a much smaller footprint than many of the coffee makers out there and does not take up a huge amount of room on the counter.  It also has a large water reservoir so you don't need to immediately refill it after you make a cup of coffee; it has a function for \"extra hot\" coffee and brew strength, a hot water feature to make soup and tea with, and a rinse function to remove coffee residue.  If you intend to use the unit to make anything like soup, it should be rinsed immediately (using the rinse feature) after everybody has made their morning coffee so your soup does not have an off-taste.  The coffee maker can be programmed to turn on in the morning, and off when no one is home, and includes a digital clock.  The unit is fairly intuitive and easy to use.  I also love that you can use your own coffee and are not forced to purchase a bunch of expensive, wasteful pods.<br /><br />On the Con side, and this is a kind of a big Con, the unit is very cheaply made of lightweight plastic, including all moving parts.  The underside of the brewing latch of the unit is not finished off very professionally, to the degree that when I initially opened it, I thought the top was broken and the coffee maker needed to be returned.  I realized that the coffee maker was simply made that way after watching a video on YouTube of the unit being used.<br /><br />Out of the box, the brewing chamber of the unit does not open or close smoothly, is very stiff and strange to open and close,  and makes a sound somewhere between a squeak and a groan when the unit is opened to insert the coffee pod.  The unit does become easier to open and close with use, and the sound it used to make is gone.<br /><br />You will also think that the unit takes a long time to brew coffee.  There is a very good reason for this;  the super hot water needs to spend time with the coffee grounds to make superior tasting coffee, which it does.  So, waiting the few extra seconds is definitely worth the time it takes.  When you taste your coffee and want to start singing, it's so good, you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />So, while I wish this unit was made of metal and was sturdy, I can't fault its performance, which is the whole point. It makes such an awesome cup of coffee that if it does die, I'll probably replace it with another unit of the same brand.",

I compost mine in my Lomi inside, but there is no reason they can't go out to the compost bin or even be buried here and there in your container garden. No more stopping up the sink drain with coffee grounds either.

    "text": "I'm not a commercial cold-brew coffee maker, but I was offered these filter bags on Vine for review and thought I might try them for making comfrey tea and other compost teas in five-gallon buckets outside. Anyone who has made comfrey compost tea knows how ghastly smelly it can be, especially when adding in worm castings. Being able to pull the whole mess out at once instead of having to manually strain out the solids sounded like a fantastic use for this product.<br /><br />Then I was given enough blueberries to make 12 gallons of fresh blueberry puree...and about the only thing I could think of to do with all that was to dive in and try to make some country wine. Most of what I have read advises to keep the fruit puree in the primary fermenter to extract more fruit flavor, then strain out the solids before moving to susbsequent fermentation stages. I wondered if perhaps I could use these cold-brew filtering bags to make my job dealing with this massive amount of blueberry puree a little easier. I've never done this before and don't have all the fancy-schmancy equipment or knowledge, so experienced wine-makers may not think this is a good idea, but I don't know anyone to ask.<br /><br />So I fed the Amazon sales page information on this product into ChatGPT and asked if I might be able to use these bags for making country wines. The response: Based on the information you provided about the commercial cold-brew coffee straining bags, it seems like they could be a good option for straining pureed fruit when making country wines. The thicker non-woven material of the bags should be able to capture fine impurities and fruit particles, which is an important consideration when making wine. Additionally, the fact that the bags are designed to capture oils and bitterness in coffee without affecting the final flavor suggests that they may be effective at preserving the flavor of the fruit. While the bags are marketed as disposable, it sounds like they could potentially be reused for multiple batches, although I would caution that using them for multiple batches could increase the risk of contamination or flavor transfer between batches. If you're just using them for a single batch and then composting the contents, however, that should not be an issue. Overall, it seems like the bags could be a good option for straining pureed fruit when making country wines. Just be sure to sanitize the bags before use and carefully follow any instructions for their use and disposal.<br /><br />Looks like I'm golden good to go!",

Actually, given the way I'm likely to use these, one lid is really all I need, even if used side by side.<br /><br />I have one Easter Egger hen, Pippin, who really puts out the eggs. Not enough eggs that I don't often buy an 18-count carton at the grocery store, but enough that I have to be concerned about keeping track of which eggs are the oldest so they can be used first. A \"first in/first out\" setup like you find with can rollers is ideal, and until now I didn't have that option for eggs. My countertop spiral egg skelter has too steep of a roll and, sometimes, one of Pippin's eggs will be too big to fit in it.<br /><br />These egg holders, first and foremost, fit in the fridge very well. They roll the eggs gently. The incline is slight, so the eggs definitely roll down when you take one out, but not so fast that the eggs break. To do a first in/first out storage, however, requires always having to take the lid off to put the new egg(s) toward the back, so I won't use the lid. This is okay with me. I'll use the bottom egg holder for my 18-count white large eggs that I get from the grocery store and the top egg holder (sans lid) to put each day's new egg toward the back of a stack. (Or maybe I'll use the lid with the grocery store eggs and put Pippin's egg holder beside it with no lid. I don't want to have to take the lid off each day I add an egg. This will leave room to put something else on top of the lidded egg tray.)<br /><br />I haven't quite worked out my rotational system yet, but I'll probably plan to pull my eggs from left to right and also put in new eggs from left to right at the top (back) of the stacks. Right now, I've got 10 blue eggs, so I put three stacks of three and then the extra egg at the top of the left stack. As I take out the eggs, the stacks will roll down and the fresher eggs will be in the back. I won't have to remember which ones are which, and this will work great. For the lower holder, I will fill the whole thing with 18 eggs, pull them from the tray until they are gone, and then order a new carton.<br /><br />The piece that fits the lower egg holder for stacking another tray on top is very sturdy and neatly designed. I really like this set of egg holders, and it's definitely going to make my life easier.",

Even though my CuisinStar coffee maker says not to use anything but \"authorized\" K cups in its K cup holder, these K cup replacements work fantastic. I can not only use them for coffee (not Espresso grind, however), I can put loose teas in them to make various herbal blends; the pressure of the water going through the K cup seems to extract the flavor as well as steeping the tea leaves for several minutes.<br /><br />Once you finish with a K cup, you simply dump out the grounds and rinse it with hot water at the sink. If the mesh does get gunked up with fine particles, you can run them through the dishwasher or even bake them at high temperature in the oven to burn the residue to ash before brushing it away. Every one of these cups is machined exactly the same, so the lids are interchangeable. Each lid has a little triangle on one side that you are instructed to have facing you when you put the K cup into the coffee machine. A small scoop with a cleaning brush on the other end is included. I'm pleased.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm just in love with these stainless K cups. I use them every single day, brewing at least two cups in the morning and a decaf cup or two at night. I have had no trouble whatsoever with them getting clogged up because I promptly scrape out the spent grounds with a grapefruit knife into my grounds jar (for my garden) and rinse thorough with water. I haven't even had to use a brush with them. Just don't use a grind that is too fine and be sure not to let them sit for hours before you empty them out. Of, if you do, let them dry thoroughly first, then dump the grounds. This four-pack of K cups is by far one of the best products I've ever gotten on Amazon.",

    "text": "We've been using Oxo's pour-over set to make our coffee for several years after having much frustration learning how to adequately do pour-overs. But now we're tired of the plastic and the paper coffee filters, so we've been exploring other ways to make our pour-over coffee. One thing I've learned with these stainless steel filters is that you cannot use finely ground coffee in them or they get gunked up and no longer work. The key, apparently, is to clean them immediately after use, but what does that mean?<br /><br />This Nuben filter came with clear instructions on how to clean the filter (I will use a bamboo toothbrush) and what to do if it does get gunked up (you essentially burn the accumulated debris to ash in a very hot oven, then brush it out!). And I can tell you, I really do like the design of this filter, with its little center cone to help balance the extraction; it really makes a LOT of sense how they designed this.<br /><br />The only thing I don't love, and it's more a problem with me not yet having a feel for good pour-over method, is that it's hard to tell when you've poured enough, but not too much, water when pouring from a kettle. As with any pour-over (except for Oxo's, which takes care of it for you), you pour a little, wait about 30 seconds for the grounds to bloom, then finish the pour by spiraling out from the center. But because the water is dripping through fairly quickly, how do you know when you've poured too much?<br /><br />I'll figure it out.",

    "text": "I have mason jars out the kazoo that I use for everything. I read reviews on Amazon for the different cold-brew filters available for mason jars, and this one got the best reviews so I ordered it. I've done two batches of coffee concentrate so far, using 12 oz. of Kirkland Signature ground Columbian coffee, then fill the jar to the top, and it's turned out very well. If I am careful not to stir too vigorously, even this fairly fine drip grind works well with little sediment, which falls to the bottom of the jar. So I have not had to use a coffee filter to filter the concentrate, although I might filter the dregs at the bottom into the next batch. I've found the filter easy to rinse out before starting a new batch. Haven't put it through the dishwasher yet....<br /><br />We were using a kettle and pour-over using Oxo's little pour-over coffee set, and we've been going through filters pretty quickly. I far prefer dumping coffee grounds directly into the garden without the filters having to decompose also. It's actually quicker to make our coffee in the morning using the concentrate method. We just pour about a quarter of our mug full of the concentrate (SigO likes it stronger) and swirl-pour hot water to fill the mug. The coffee is plenty hot, but those who love to burn their tongues won't be pleased. The coffee turns out smooth and rich with no bitterness, and my stomach definitely thanks me for this.",

French press and that fits great, gets the same job done, and no more bad taste. If you tend to be sensitive to slight differences in flavors, you might want to try that instead.

    "text": "I went crazy when this Nina Soft Spin Dryer arrived. DP and I do our own laundry. He goes to the laundromat and I wash my stuff mostly by hand. He hates going to the laundromat and lets his dirty laundry pile up into huge mounds. I've been doing the hand-washing almost two years without benefit of anything but my hands and a few tub trugs and a strainer basket, but ringing out the clothes is really rough on me and I can't do the best job. DP wanted to get a small portable washing machine (which we aren't supposed to have in our apartment because of problems with leaking), but the more I read reviews of what's out there, the more I knew I did not want to spend that much money on what seem to be, today, largely inferior products. So I got this Nina dryer and one of those breathing washer things. (The latter item is a disappointment because the handle keeps falling out; it'll work great if I glue the handle into it.)<br /><br />But this dryer! I am so knocked-out thrilled with it that I wanted to wash all the dirty laundry in the house, not only mine but DP's. He had 2 sets of full-sized sheets (one mismatched with a queen-sized flannel top sheet), two shams, and a pillowcase that I said I would wash for him because I was having so much fun with this Nina dryer. After the aggravation with the loose breathing washer handle, I just slopped those sopping-wet sheets into the dryer. I didn't even try to balance them much. I did them in three loads and just threw the sheets in. The one flannel sheet I did by itself, and that was the only one that gave me some balancing problems that I had to rectify. The other two loads (a set of sheets in one, one bottom sheet and the shams and pillowcase in the other) settled into smooth spinning quickly after closing the lid. I just held the sides until the spinning got going good.<br /><br />Everything went from sopping wet to spun out really close to dry in a minute or two. I didn't time it; I just watched for the water coming out to reduce to a bit of dribbling, then opened the lid to stop the dryer. I threw the load I'd just spun onto the bottom shelf of my dryer rack&mdash;no dripping!&mdash;started up another one, and then hung the first one. It was so EASY! Jiminy, if I had realized how wonderful this was going to be, I would have bought one of these Nina soft spin dryers two years ago! And the clothes came out smelling so fresh and clean (thanks in part to the breathing washer thing, ECOS HD instead of Tide, and a touch of vinegar in the rinse water), it was like clothes hung on the line in the breeze and sunshine when I was a child. I used to run through the sheets, and doing this laundry was a pleasant remembrance of the past.<br /><br />I washed two pairs of my Costco Gloria Vanderbilt denim capris and spun both pairs at the same time. I spun them until the dripping stopped, then hung them to dry. Five hours later they were almost completely dry and wearable, with only a tiny bit of moisture at the thick waist band, and it was pretty humid. I also washed a particularly nasty thick reversible white cotton rug and spun it dry in the dryer. It got a lot cleaner than it ever has in a washing machine; the threads didn't unravel more like they would have it a washer; and it was fully dry about a day later. The six bamboo T-shirts were a breeze to wash and dry; I could have put one on right out of the Nina. I'm just knocked out...",

    "text": "We finally moved to the country where I can have a huge garden, but I almost panicked when I saw how much food I was going to have to put up. Our little chest freezer is no match for it, and my dehydrator can only handle so much and is not good for everything. And DH likes \"variety,\" meaning he grumbles if he has to eat the same thing two days in a row, so I knew I'd have to break down and do some canning. But the thought of adding all that heat on top of our Georgia heatwave was unbearable.<br /><br />This Max Burton induction cooktop is a godsend. My Fagor 10-quart pressure canner works perfectly with it, and the best part is that I can bring it up to pressure with FAR less heat than electric or gas stoves put out. I just listen for it to come up to pressure, then with just a few clicks adjust the temperature down to maintenance level, set the timer, and walk off and leave it. When the time's up, the burner shuts off, and the heat is instantly OFF. This makes canning so easy and so much cooler that I find myself doing it more often. I can cook a big batch of something for dinner, then can the leftovers without it being a big ordeal. So happy DH, and I still have the economy and time-saving benefit of large-batch cooking. Cleanup is easy.<br /><br />Another thing, too, is that I'm getting older and more forgetful (or maybe it's because I have a whole lot more I have to juggle now as a \"country wife\"). I've actually burned up pots on the stove that I've forgotten about while I was busy trying to do six gazillion other things. It's a lot harder to burn down the house when using this cooktop. :)<br /><br />Other than the induction-ready cookware issue (not a problem for me), the only caveat I'd give potential buyers is that this really needs to be on its own electrical circuit. Our old house has few outlets and iffy wiring, so I do not even attempt to run the microwave and the induction cooktop at the same time because they are on the same circuit.<br /><br />This induction cooktop has really changed my life. I think everybody ought to try cooking this way. It's got to be more energy efficient. But beware: Once you've familiarized yourself with an induction cooktop, you probably won't want to cook on anything else.",

I have used it a few times to brew coffee (using up my leftover rot-gut Folgers as I make the switch to the good stuff), but this is how I use it the most:<br /><br />After we do our coffee in the morning, I pop out the K cup holder and pop in the reusuable My K Cup. I can then brew teas throughout the day using tea bags by simply placing them into the My K Cup, sans filter (which I keep pristine for fresh-ground coffee beans). I drink a lot of herb teas during the day, and while the Keurig brews them too quickly to totally extract all the goodness, that's the way I like my medicinal herb teas: a little on the weak side. Of course, I could run the hot water through the Keurig and then steep the tea bags. But putting the My K Cup into the machine gives me a lot of different options. I mean, shoot, I can run out a cup of hot water and make homemade soup with my dehydrated cooked noodles or rice and dehydrated veggies! So I'm more likely to use up my store....<br /><br />At night, before I go to bed, I pop out the My K Cup and pop in the regular K cup holder, make sure the Keurig's water reservoir is filled up with filtered water from my Big Berkey (conveniently located right there at the sink), and go off to a blissful sleep, knowing my DH can stagger in there in the morning and make his coffee with no problems.

    "text": "After looking for many Over the stove vent hood that i could afford, i decided to purchase the Cosmo UMC30 for $199.00. I thought it was too big for my kitchen but it came perfect fit, looks awesome, I love the lighting that provides. The electronic window with the clock is an added feature that i love. It is slick and beautiful. THe only drawback is that the noise level is not as quiet as I thought.Well, you cannot checked that until is installed. But has three noise levels, the quietest is level 1. It absorbes steam very well. I don't think is a big deal but it is better than the one i had, noisy crazy it was. I recommend it.!!  I loved the removable filters, you see underneath the vent, easy to clean, metallic all the way, no more mesh that stay greasy and ugly!",

I am a single semi-retired woman and only did 1 small load a week,so what the heck I'll give it a try. Great choice! It comes in several pieces but I had it put together in a couple minutes. I keep it in the bathroom and just toss clothes in as needed. When I'm ready to use it I put it in the bathtub,and separate clothes if needed. I can easily put in several shirts a pair of lightweight pants,socks and undies.I use the shower hose to fill it up add a little detergent and put on the lid  (make sure to tighten the knob on top) give it 30 easy spins then change directions and give it 30 hard spins and repeat the process a time or two. If it feels like it is just thumping back and forth ,open the top and add more water then spin.The discharge tube is a little difficult but you will get the hang of it! Make sure to open the top. I am always amazed at the dirty water that comes out! when the draining slows down I remove the tube and flip the tub over and empty the rest of the water as i am taking the clothes out and wringing them. To rinse just put the clothes back in add water spin and and drain again. I'm not crazy about wringing them out, but I use a metal colander and  some fist action. If you have a dryer toss them in but I usually just hang them to dry.If I have a really dirty pair of jeans after working in the yard I will put them in the tub with water and detergent give it a few spins and let it presoak till morning then spin away. The whole process only takes about 5-6 minutes and clothes come out as clean as they would in a washing machine. I don't think I would recommend this for a large family (unless you want to do several loads a day) but for one or two people it is great!",

    "text": "We recently bought a new LG washer/dryer pair. The dryer is the DLEX7880WE, which is near top of the line in the 7000 series. It even has the steam feature! Our laundry room is a bit odd; the dryer is on the left and the washer on the right - that's how the builder set it up! The dryer vent system in the house is in the wall to the left of the dryer. Once the dryer is installed, the ducting to the wall makes 3 90 degree turns, then another 90 degree turn up the wall, and finally another 90 degree turn in the ceiling between the 1st and 2nd floor to the exit outside the house. You really shouldn't have more than 3 turns in the system to improve efficiency. Luckily, the dryer is preset to add the 4 way dryer vent kit made by LG. The manual calls out that kit as 383EEL9001B. Turns out that kit is discontinued, replaced by the 3911EZ9131X. The print manual with the dryer makes a few notes that are NOT in the installation sheet with the kit, but make the job much easier. Of importance, mate the elbow to the duct that extends out the side of the dryer before installing it through that opening, and use appropriate HVAC duct tape (not what you normally think of as Duct Tape). This stuff is higher temp with an adhesive system designed for the dryer temps. Secondly, the manual with the dryer notes that the duct extending out the side of the dryer should extend about 1-1/2\". I'm here to tell you that the duct provided in the kit only gives about 1/2\" extension out the side of the dryer. What to do? I used a hack saw and tin snips, and shortened the duct originally provided in the dryer that goes from the front to the rear exit. It's removed anyway, and it's longer length allowed me to shorten it and use as the extension to the side, clearing the cabinet by 1-1/2\". One thing NOTspecifically noted, is that the flanged end of the extension duct that goes from the elbow to outside should mate to the elbow, and not be hanging out the side of the dryer. I found the dryer temp capable HVAC duct tape by 3M at the big box blue home improvement store, but I'm sure the orange one or even Amazon has that duct tape available. I knocked off a star for \"easy to install\" because I had to improvise on the extension tube, and knocked off a star for \"value for money\" because this kit is really overpriced. Basically, this is all sheet metal. I did save by buying a \"Used - Very Good\" condition kit, rather than the brand spanking new one. It took a few hours, didn't require disassembly of the entire dryer. One last tip: unplug the dryer, turn off the cold water line and remove the line to the dryer (if you have the steam feature), and then turn the dryer on its side, on towels or a blanket or ??? It makes the job so much easier!!",

Terrible performance.<br /><br />Seems the electronic controller has lost its mind. Lights report “Add Water” when it's full of water and “Ice Full” when not a single cube is in the hopper. If it makes any ice at all, it melts in the hopper, then quits. It's now sitting, completely useless.<br /><br />It worked fine for a year and a half.<br /><br />Not reliable at all.<br /><br />$135 piece of landfill junk.<br /><br />I feel cheated and very disappointed.

So no matter how the outlet is mounted, you can have the wire go in the direction you desire. I thought I was going to have to remount the outlets to accommodate the plug, but it turns out this plug easily accommodates the outlet, no matter how it's positioned in its box.<br /><br />Expensive, yes. Best plug in the world, also yes. Every Hubbell plug I've ever attached is a winner.<br /><br />Strain relief is substantial. The cord will not fall out of the outlet.<br /><br />Internally, Hubbell's standard sure-fire wire attachment system allows backwiring with assurance there will be no internal shorts or stray wire strands. Wires go into individual holes and segregate all conductors cleanly so nothing can short out. Wiring stripping gauge is molded into the plug, so you know exactly how to strip the wire. But there's also an 8-1/2x11, clearly-written instruction sheet with clear illustrations in a couple of languages, including English. Like I said, excellent engineering.<br /><br />It may be expensive but as the saying goes, quality is appreciated long after price is forgotten.",

    "title": "\"Sort\" of resettable if it \"blows\"",
    "text": "This is the infamous Whirlpool/Kitchenaid thermal fuse that blows when you run the cleaning cycle on the Kitchenaid KGSA906PSS range. You know, the problem everyone has, but Kitchenaid denies even happens; the reason I'll not buy Kitchenaid appliances again. All because of this fuse. Or rather, the poor implementation of the fuse into the design.<br /><br />Anyway, when it blows about an hour into the cleaning cycle because by design the oven gets so hot it blows the fuse (good job, Kitchenaid!), the door will remain locked closed and the timer display will go black. No clock, no controls. The burners will still light. That means power is getting to the stove, but the oven will be dead.<br />So if you need the oven, you are out of luck. DO NOT CLEAN THIS OVEN if you need it within a week.<br /><br />You will have to turn off the gas, unplug the power and disconnect the supply pipe from the range (I do that by removing the storage drawer and reaching underneath to disconnect from the range) then pull the range out enough so you can get behind it. There's a 24\"x24\" panel on the back held on with about 15 black square drive screws and an upper panel that is held on by a few Phillips drive screws. After removing the panels, you can see the fuse, attached to the back of the oven box, waiting for you to run the cleaning cycle so it can blow and cost you $40.<br /><br />After I got the replacement part reinstalled and put all the screws back in, plugged it in and reconnected the gas, everything worked as before.<br /><br />So I went out to the garage and took the blown fuse apart. It's a shame you cannot reset the fuse. There's no real reason you can't except they didn't design a little reset button into the fuse.<br /><br />The fuse \"blows\" when a little bimetal disc inside the fuse heats up and pops like a bottle cap, which allows a little plastic piston to move. This in turn allows two electrical contacts to separate. This turns off the power to the display, leaves the door locked and shuts off the gas to the stove. The oven then cools down, but the fuse stays in the \"off\" mode.<br /><br />After replacing the part and getting the oven to work, I broke the Bakelite open on the old fuse to see the innards. All I really needed to do was drill a tiny hole through the metal outer cap (but not through the bimetal) then poke a toothpick into the hole and pop the bimetal disc back into its original shape. It's not worth the trouble, but in a real pinch, it might work. The other way is to jumper over the two contacts, but of course, that's not recommended. We've had this range since 2005, though, and the fuse never blew before...because we never ran the cleaning cycle. So the fuse is there only in case you run the cleaning cycle. Apparently the oven box gets so hot during the normal cleaning cycle by design it can't stand it.<br /><br />Both my wife and I live-chatted with Kitchen reps. They asked if an electrical fuse had popped at the box and other lame excuses, all while denying there was any reported problem. But a quick net search shows many people have had this problem. It's big enough that Amazon carries this one part and \"8300802\" returns a lot of hits.<br /><br />I'm glad Amazon had the part. It got here in a hurry and it was the right part. Kitchenaid needs to stick with stand mixers and get out of the appliance biz.",

Now I use the Keurig coffees for special occasions or as a special treat and use these reusable filters for everyday. The filters wash up very easily and seem quite sturdy.

It has been fixed several times and still leaks, doesn't spin out, and the dryer isn't powerful enough. We had been going to the laundromat weekly and our clothes came out smelling like nothing. But with this thing our clothes smell good and are dry within 30 mins in our crappy dryer.<br /><br />Pros<br />- cheap<br />- small<br />- spins clothes to nearly dry<br /><br />Cons<br />- makes more noise than a standard washer<br />- can only wash a small amount at a time<br />- more time consuming than a standard washer if you are doing more than one load<br /><br />Tips<br />- do your laundry daily (or if you rewear clothes then do it when you have 2 outfits to wash)<br /><br />- sit it in the tub and fill it with the shower head if you have a removable shower head. It makes it so much easier than trying to get it to attach to a faucet.<br /><br />- do NOT over load it, it won't break but it won't properly agitate the clothes either.<br /><br />- keep in mind that a standard washer drains and fills almost as much as this thing, you just don't see it because it does it automatically.",

One of the best things about this model is that you can use the spinner while the washer side is running. The spinner is incredible. The clothes get barely damp.<br /><br />Tips:<br />Reuse the wash water. I just rinse the clothes with running water while they sit in the spinner, then spin them. (Drain hose down.)<br /><br />Don't use too much soap.<br /><br />Lay the drain hose down right away. It won't drain the washer unless you have it set to drain, but it will drain the spinner side.<br /><br />Put a strainer in your tub drain to catch the lint.<br /><br />Clean the washer lint trap.<br /><br />Leave the washer/spinner doors open when finished to air dry.<br /><br />Use the plastic topper that comes with the spinner. Put the soaking clothes in, add the topper and gently push the clothes to the bottom of the spinner. This way, the spinner won't cause the whole unit to jump around because the clothes are compacted at the bottom of the spinner.",

Next up I determined that the control boards were bad as evidenced by the LEDs not working. No dice or no ice. Last step was to replace the water valve. I removed the old one and discovered that it had five inlet and outlet connections. The new one only has three. I spent a couple of days figuring out in my mind how it all works, and determined that the water first ran through the filter, then to the ganged valves and then the water dispenser and ice maker. The filter was worthless in my view, $35 and change every 3 months or so. No. I re-engineered the system and eliminated the filter. Next problem. The two valve sets are shaped nothing alike, so it was impossible to mount the thing to the frame of the fridge. It now just kind of hangs there supported by the wires and tubing. It does work, and the machine is merrily making ice.",
