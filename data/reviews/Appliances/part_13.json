It came in perfect condition, in the brand box, and then I faced the challenge of finding a local worker or contractor to install it.<br /><br />That part took about five months as everyone was out working on new home construction, or out moose hunting, or fishing over the summer, but I can happily say it is finally installed, and it's been working just great. There was a lot of frustration for me along the way, but now that it's up and in, I'm glad I waited, and I bought the product I'd chosen - this one. It's very nice. There is a place for two light bulbs, and the light dims to a lower brightness, and a higher one. There are two fans, low, and high, and either way it works great, and I'm very satisfied with this purchase. It's a very attractive and good quality, and a highly useful addition to my kitchen, and I'm very happy to have it.<br /><br />Update: several years later, I'm still very happy with this product, and happy I chose it.

It was awesome - made great, soft, nugget ice just like it was supposed to - until it didn't. Exactly one year and two weeks after purchase (right after the one-year warranty), it stopped making ice. We tried all of the trouble-shooting - reset it, unplug it and wait a few hours, clean with vinegar, check the water lines. Nothing helped. It will make about a tablespoon of ice and then quit. Disappointing that a $580 appliance is only good for one year (and two weeks). If you want to pay an average of $50/month for the good ice for about a year, go for it. Just don't be surprised when it breaks.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by all of the 5-star reviews. I would have given it a 5-star review as well for the first 12 months.

My install (basement) required the vent to come up approx 7 feet from the ground dryer vent exhaust.

Heck, give it a try.  I use the roll bags that have to be sealed first at the bottom.  They say to start at 3 and I did and no soap, leaked.  It looked sealed, but wasn't holding vacuum.  I went to 5 and that did the trick and it was quick, only a few seconds.  The light comes on and goes out, done.  5 did well, so I went to 4 and that did well too.  So 4 it is.  For some things like chicken leg quarters, I will seal the top again after the food saver does it to ensure a good seal.  The juices cause a problem and some will leak.  If I double seal, I think I can solve the problem.  It comes with two replacement elements too which is great.  I doubt I will ever need both, but nice to have.  I used 8\" and 11\" rolls and am very satisfied so far.",

For the first day, I used bowls to fill the machine which was a lot of work but did the job. The next day, I bought a funnel big enough to cover my shower head, drilled two holes on opposite sides at the top, and used a small bungie cord to put a hook into each hole and then hang it over the shower head. I then cut two slits into the hose to allow the funnel to fit inside the faucet end, then duct taped it to seal. I attached the hose to the machine and it worked perfectly. My shower is low flow so I could turn it on full. I put the machine in the shower and ran it from there with no issues, other than to hold the machine when the spinner starts up because the vibration is very strong. My overall reaction is that it does a good job cleaning and the spinner is very good. Similar to a spa's machine to dry your bathing suit. It is labor intensive because you must move the clothes a few at a time to the spinner and you can only put a few things in at a time, but my clothes dry beautifully on a rack and the towels only need 15 minutes in a dryer at the laundromat until I can string up a clothesline in the summer.

    "text": "Look, this is a great little pitcher, solid, hi-Q. But it's frustrating to read &#34;Size: 4.5&#34;L x 3&#34;W x 3.75&#34;H&#34;, then, lower down the page, &#34;Product Dimensions: 3.5 x 3.5 x 4 inches&#34;. So, maybe those are meaningless details. For me, whether or not I could press a cup from Aeropress into it was of interest. Well, the answer is yes; the 2 11/16&#34; OD filter holder of the Aero does fit, somewhat snugly. In fact, it's noticeably more snug when hot, just AFTER the shot. But, it's a clean press, no breaching over the rim.  In the end, it does work fine for Aeropress, in addition to frothing, so I'm glad I took a chance by buying it.",

No clogs so it was the pump that had failed. Replaced it with this pump for $30 (compared to $150 for the Whirlpool pump). The pump fits correctly and is quiet. It is made more cheaply than the OEM pump. Most notably, a couple of shields and wiring clips are missing and the plastic housing is thinner. Definitely feels cheaper in hand. However, it works. How long it lasts remains to be seen, but it only takes about 15 minutes to change it and I can replace 5 of these for the price of 1 Whirlpool unit.

The second time we used it the drain hose flipped out of the sink and the entire washing machine drained onto our bathroom floor.

My husband uses his favorite flavored coffees and I get fresh roasted, local beans, grind them up and put them in the Ekobrew.  Now we're both happy and no longer paying an exorbitant amount for coffee.  The only down side is if you grind your beans too small, they may get stuck in the mesh, so make sure (if you're getting local beans), you either have them grind for you at a regular drip grind, or get a burr grinder so you can make sure they grind evenly and avoid coffee dust getting stuck in your Ekobrew!",

If you're drip pans are that dirty, it's not worth the effort to clean.<br /><br />This is also a great price.  I was just looking at the exact same thing at the local box store, but you only got one large and one small for the same amount of money.<br /><br />Finally, don't go by the sizes.  They freaked me out a bit with their sizing because my coils alone are 6&#34; and 8&#34; so I was worried these would end up being too small.  They fit perfectly.

    "text": "Our Samsung DW is 7 years old and has been giving us random error codes for the past 1-2 years. At first it appeared that it was the temperature sensor. We replaced that in Aug 2020 and everything was back to normal. Then in Aug 2021 we were getting the same error messages. Replaced the temperature sensor again and it was fine for about another month.<br /><br />Then we started getting the delicate flashing error after the full wash cycle ended, indicated a drainage issue. We checked all the drainage lines, which were clear, and there was not any water left in the DW to indicate a drainage issue. I dealt with it for awhile and I'd leave the DW door open to air dry (since the dishes were clean...). I was getting real fed up with the DW and the flashing error codes!<br /><br />I decided to try 1 more fix before just biting the bullet and buying a new DW. Decided it was time to try to replace the main control panel for $150 before spending $500+ on a new machine. Installation was relatively easy (didn't need to pull machine out, took about 5 minutes, easy to find YouTube video).<br /><br />This fix has worked great! It's been a full month with no error messages! It's like our machine is brand new, Actually better than new since now our machine doesn't leak at the beginning of the DW cycle anymore! (it's done this from the start 7 years ago, stumped the Samsung guy while it was still under warranty and we just always cleaned up the small quarter-sized leak at the beginning of each DW cycle)",

    "text": "We were having an issue with our dishwasher flashing the delicate light and not completing full cycles (it would fill with water, drain, fill with water, drain, then stop after 9 minutes). Read several posts about potential issues. Most say it's a drainage problem. All the drainage hoses on ours were wide open and clean. Found a thread that mentioned the thermistor sensor. Ordered a different thermistor, then pull our dishwasher out and realized we needed this part instead. Watched the video online how to do this (repairclinic.com has great step by step videos) and my husband and I did it ourselves!! Great to have a working dishwasher again. For reference my dishwasher model is DW80F600UTS/AA. Regarding comments about 3 vs 4-wire model, my husband installed this when I was at work, he thinks ours had 4 wires (I'm not pulling out the DW again to verify!)",

    "title": "Finally! Something to wash plushies and shoes... and so much more!",
    "text": "I originally got this for in case the electricity goes out, which occurs from time to time due to living in an old home with outdated electrical wiring and living in Hurricane zone (South Florida). However, I tried it out on a pair of sneakers (my washing machine can't handle shoe washing) and I have to say I will be using this to wash shoes, boots and plushies that can't be washed in the washing machine. It really handles the heavy duty stuff well. Just spin the barrel slowly and it wouldn't crack. It also drains well, but make sure to wash it out the dirt in the barrel before washing anything else afterwards and give a second cycle, since shoes will have dirt residue. This is normal, since it is also an issue in electrical washing machines. Biggest difference is that this barrel won't break down or turn off. I LOVE IT! I highly recommend it and for $50 bucks it is well worth it! The only thing I have a complain over are the o-rings to hold the machine in place of its legs. The o-rings move too much. I feel like key chain rings would hold in place better but I haven't tried it out. I also feel that the barrel should have a hole at the bottom to have a removable plug to remove the water manually and to allow drainage while respinning to \"spin dry\" the items inside to make drying the items easier. Rather than twisting the extra water out by hand. Even with these two complaints, I am really happy with the purchase. It is still an easier nonelectric method than using the hands 100% for washing. This is a must for those who wash by hand or need something that will wash heavy items that the ordinary electrical washing machine can't handle.",

    "text": "I just love this machine.  It has quite a powerful motor on both the washer and dryer.  It also has a very large tub.  No matter how dirty, the clothes always come out clean and in only 15 minutes.<br />  People say if the dryer makes noise it's because the clothes are unbalanced but I find that it actually wants MORE clothes.  When I add more clothes, you can't believe how quiet and powerful the motor is.<br />  I rinse my clothes in clean water going through another wash cycle but with less water and using much less time.  The hoses are very flimsy, so it's best to get maybe a hair washing hose and let the water go into the tub.  I use my washer at the kitchen sink and hook the drain hose in the sink as well.  I just push my dish pan against it to hold it in.  No problems.<br />  I store my machine in my pantry with the hoses in the machine, leaving the washer door slightly ajar.  You cant beat this for apartment washing and smaller loads make it convient to seperate clothing into sweaters, delicates, whites and my granddaughters clothing with all the sequins and all their red Christmas pajamas.  Thank you Della for this exquisite machine.",

    "title": "So Quiet!!",
    "text": "I love how quiet this dishwasher is!  This is the first dishwasher I have owned with a stainless steel tub and I can really tell the difference!  We replaced our Kenmore Ultrawash model that we purchased in 2007 because it was SO LOUD!  We could barely hear the television in the next room and my husband wouldn't let me run it at night because it was loud when we were sleeping so I had to run it during the day.  My review compares this new Bosch to the old Kenmore.<br /><br />Also, we had quite a time with Best Buy.  We purchased the floor model so we saved a chunk of money.  However, they forgot to give us the installation kit so we had no instructions and no parts.  It should have been a 30 minute installation but after 3 ½ hours, 2 trips to the hardware store, and one HUGE marital fight, we figured this out.  At that point it was already installed (and we weren't speaking!).  However, I discovered a week later that the dishwasher was leaking so I called Best Buy and told them my husband was on his way to get the installation kit.  They didn't ask me any information about what we purchased but said they could sell us something.  I told them we needed it for free.  My husband got to the store and needed the model number.  He couldn't get ahold of me, and for some reason they didn't/couldn't look it up in the computer, so he ended up going to Lowe's and spending another $30.  Due to this, I would never buy the floor model again - but if you do, be sure to get the install kit with delivery!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />*QUIET - yes, you can hear it, but it sounds like a soft rain.  We can watch television and have a conversation in the same room because it's so quiet.  That was my main criteria!  If it wasn't quiet, I was going to return it.<br />*racks slide well - my Kenmore felt really cheap because of the ways the racks slid out but this Bosch is great - the bottom rack doesn't come off of the track<br />*stays clean inside - having a stainless steel tub means that it doesn't stain like the old white tub.  I still try to add vinegar for most washes just to make sure<br />*cleans fine - cleaning is not superb (at least for the general wash cycle) but it cleans just fine.  I tried the pots & pans setting last time but my husband emptied the dishwasher so I don't know if the dishes came out cleaner.  I still don't put in caked on dishes and definitely not dried cheese<br />*makes dishes relatively dry - dishes are not perfectly dry when the cycle is done but they're good enough.  I usually open the door and let them finish air drying overnight<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Smaller capacity - this is likely due to the insulation but I will take this any day due to how quiet this machine is<br />*Not the best configuration - I'm not really excited about the configuration in the racks.  It seems really close together and it's not easy to put glasses or pans on the bottom rack.<br />*Dinging when it's done - this is annoying and loud.  I tried to figure out how to make it stop but I made it worse!  Instead of dinging 5 times - twice - it dinged 5 times for at least 5 times before I shut the dishwasher off.  However, I googled it last week and figured it out so no more dinging.  (The only bad thing now is I don't know when it's done so I just wait a couple of hours before I open it up to let the dishes finish drying.)<br /><br />One other note: I read online today that the best way to clean stainless steel is with a little olive oil and a cotton cloth so I'll try that tonight.",

I love the design where it is seamless in the front. The light feature included is a bit on the dimmer side of what I would like it to be. The 6” diameter aluminum duct that is included with the package was only able to stretch out to a bit shy of 5-feet without tearing, it tore when we stretched to or past 5 feet, so we had to go to Home Depot to buy a new and longer one for our kitchen. My husband and I installed it and I find it very interesting. I still cannot believe that heavy hood is simply anchored by two nails; it's still holding up so those two nails are doing a mighty fine job!",

Deducted a star because not as leveled as we like them to be and deducted another star because I feel one of the replacement elements is much hotter than the other and when compared to the original heating element parts the stove came with, which might explain why one of the pots was melted and stained onto the replacement element which made us realize, use stainless steel with no coating on that replacement element.",

We looked in our manual and the instructions weren't very specific, so we found a video online to help us with installation.<br /><br />The freezer door is an exact match and doesn't look like a replacement at all. There's one tip I would like to share. You must remove the seal or rubber gasket from the old freezer door and use it on the new freezer door. Make sure you remove it carefully, so you don't rip it. It's the only thing you will need to save from your old door.<br /><br />We are very happy with our purchase and our refrigerator is back to looking brand new again!",

It has great reviews. I love the design of the lettering. It is very sturdy. Instead of having to flip the sign over, we just slide it in the other direction to reveal dirty or clean.

With the Ready Set, I can put freshly ground the beans in the filter, set it over my mug, pour hot water, and I'm ready to go. The water trickles through the tiny hole at a slow pace, and you must be patient. The side vents on the design allow heat to escape, which is a bit of a problem if you like piping hot coffee, but other than that, it's a simple, inexpensive, and useful gadget.

You can put any type of coffee grinds that you would usually use in a regular coffee machine into these kcup filters to be used in a kcup machine. We have a kcup machine at work, but I just drink regular coffee at home so these come in handy when I need a pick me up at the office. I keep a small can of Folgers in my desk and just put a few scoops in and I am ready to go. The lid easily comes up to fill it and easily locks back into place for use. I love that they are reusable and fairly easy to clean. I have a little brush I like to use on the stainless steel as coffee grinds can be messy.

    "text": "Ive had these for over a month and although I can't speak for the longevity of the machines, i can say that they are wonderful so far. We ordered them upon moving so I had quite a bit of laundry when they got here and I put them to the test load after load for 2 days, down comforter, dirty farm clothes, kids clothes, cleaning rags and towels. It does them all in record time! I did read a lot of reviews and hesitated for weeks on making the decision to buy online, but it worked out great. I thought the customer service was just fine and they were easy to put together. However just to clarify YOU NEED HOT AND COLD WATER HOSES TO HOOK UP AND A DRYER CORD THAT MATCHES YOUR OUTLET. They hoses that come with allow you to hook the dryer and Y it to the  COLD water spout and connect the washer to that (with the hoses you buy). Trying to explain all questions and other complaints that I saw and worked through. I saw another complaint that they got a NO WATER display on the washer. I did get one of those when washing the fleece blankets. the problem wasn't the machine malfunctioning, it was telling you it couldn't complete. When i looked in, i noticed the blankets were really sudsy, so what the NO WATER meant is it wanted to drain more, it sensed the bubbles but had no water. I simply ran a rinse cycle and it was fine. I had a problem with those type of blankets in my other washer getting really sudsy too with the same soap i do with other loads.<br />The pedestals are awesome with the spring release you can simply nudge it with your toe and it will glide open and do the same to close it! same with the doors. I can walk to the washer with a handful of clothes and just press the door and it pops open with tons of room! The lighting on these are fantastic and the noise the make it VERY MINIMAL. we made very sure the pedestals were set where they would be and leveled before pulling them out to install the W&D to the tops. And another thing i didn't know from the description is that apart from the steam/sanitize feature in both, the washer has a fresh rinse so the water in the rinse doesn't go through the soap container like other washers thus reducing soap residue. And the spin cycle is so efficient that I kid you not they are almost dry when you put them in the dryer! I am truly in heaven as a mostly stay at home mom of a farmer, two boys and an indoor dog, I do a LOT of laundry! This set has a setting for pet beds, towels, comforter, jeans along with all the others. The quick steam dry allows me to continue not to own an iron which i love and the sanitize dry allows me to have clean pillows without the lumps from the washer. There is also a shrink guard setting on the dryer mind you. So I hope that helps others make any decision they might be hesitating with.",

Screws came in the top wheels instead of the bottom ones (why?), so I used the old screws for the bottom wheels. Strings (called cables?) were slightly shorter, but I was able to use them. Good luck NOT having springs pop out of back holes! You have to be a contortionist to attach springs. Saw the same product for less money, but reviews complained they didn't fit Kenmore Elite so I spent a little more to be safe. Model # 665.17464300. Took about an hour, including time to find right sockets (5/16) and wrench. Only had to disconnect fill line - drain line and power cord were long enough. Test run happening now.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:deb7a7b9f478e538d957cb4003f30987]] This is the egg rack that I've been looking for!<br /><br />It stacks vertically so it minimizes its footprint in the fridge, it holds three layers of 10 eggs each.<br /><br />The super cool feature I was not expecting is the shelves that hold the eggs are spring loaded and automatically fold up out of the way when that shelf is empty.<br /><br />The weight of a single egg is enough to keep the shelf deployed downward, as soon as the last egg is lifted it automatically folds up and out of the way to expose the next layer of eggs.<br /><br />It seems to be made slightly too thin plastic, I don't think it's going to last , long.  Another issue is mine received a very small crack during shipping, which is not the end of the world except it is in a very vulnerable location, in the very center of the top rack., So structurally it is in the weakest part of the shelf.  That's a bad spot because it could easily spread. Perhaps if they made this out of slightly heavier plastic this would not be an issue.<br /><br />Another flaw is that if you stack two eggs directly on top of each other they can touch, this isn't a real big problem just something I noticed.",

After hand washing, and squeezing clothes, it could take on the order of an hour or more to get clothes dry using the Panda alone. The nice thing about the Panda is that it plugs into a standard 120 v socket; but this limits its drying power. So sometimes I'd take the clothes out of the Panda before they were bone dry.<br /><br />Now, with the Nina spin dryer, the clothes come out in a few minutes and are dryer than when I used to impatiently take them out out of the Panda. Then I have the option of putting the spun dry clothes in the Panda and within minutes they are completely dry.<br /><br />In summary, I can do a hand wash, spin the residual water out in the Nina, give them a few minutes heat in the Panda and thus wash & dry the clothes completely in about a half hour.",

    "text": "My 15-year old Bosch SMU 4000 died, and the research on a popular consumer site said that the top 8 dishwashers were Bosch (including this model). I also trust the reviews on Amazon, and was surprised to see the low ratings of the Bosch dishwashers. So I looked around (in person) at the other brands available and just dreaded buying anything else but Bosch. Several of the Amazon reviews had a low rating because the capacity is lower than the piece of junk they just scrapped. It makes sense to me that to make these dishwashers quiet they probably need more insulation, and it's not possible to make the dishwasher larger on the outside, so they may sacrifice some space on the inside. I accept that trade-off gladly. I did not research to see if the smaller space claim was true, because I don't mind if I have more frequent smaller loads. I liked the layout after I used it a few times, and seems very similar to my old Bosch. And it is quiet - noticeably quieter than my old one.<br /><br />The Bosch reviews in Amazon are so low and the consumer reviews are so high, that it makes me wonder who is writing the Amazon reviews. In this case only, I am glad that I didn't trust them.",

Working reliably, and putting humidity into the air. The control work well and are intuitive.  As the house does not have a water softener, the only \"drawback\" to this humidifier is that -- to keep the cost of replacement filters down -- I'm buying RO water from a local health food store, which is pretty inexpensive, but a hassle to haul.  Overall, a well built machine that's doing the intended job.<br /><br />Update 2 years into using the product:  The first year of operation was good.  No problems.  After storing the unit over the summer and getting it out for winter use, one of the two tank \"floats\" was no longer bouyant, thus the tank that it controlled would not feed water.  After contacting Honeywell, they sent a replacement float, and the unit worked well.  Now, with year 2 of winter season operation, the same thing is happening again:  one of the two floats doesn't work.  So, I am once again in process of trying to contact Honeywell to see if they will send a replacement part...and having to manually switch out the two tanks (which defeats the purpose of having the larger tank capacity.  With the float situation, my rating of this humidifier has gone from 5 to 4.",

It takes about 12 minutes for one \"batch\" of ice, which consists of about 8-12 cubes which are barely frozen. If you don't get those few cubes out immediately, they will melt. In order for one tank of water to turn into ice, you're looking at about an hour.  In order to get enough ice for 1 tumbler cup, you're looking at about 30 minutes and it will probably be melted. I guess on the other hand, if you can sit and watch the ice be made, immediately take it out and put it in the freezer, do this about every 12 minutes, and then fill up your glass with ice, this could be a good fit for you. In my opinion this machine is not fast, it is not practical, and I am really disappointed.",

    "text": "Seemed like a good product but did not fit my model when it said it would. As you can see from the pictures, the shape of the original white plastic tongs that engage the shaft are not the same shape as the replacement part. I spent so much time & frustration disassembling & trying to make it fit! Update: they No longer list my model. Maybe I originally misread it? Additional update: I ended up pushing pretty hard to seat the assembly onto the shaft. I thought it worked but the next time I disassembled the blade for cleaning, the plastic attachments were worn smooth and I don't think the chopping blade was turning anymore 😣",

    "text": "I found an awesome video that is Fagor's own DVD that someone uploaded on You Tube that shows the basic how to instructions for this exact Fagor washer/dryer combo machine FAS3612 and FAS3612X. (X- is the same exact model in stainless.)This DVD does not come with your new washer but you will want to have this video to watch when you are first learning to use this washer. The washer is complicated until you know the machine then it is easy. The manual is not completely clear. I did not have this video when I first tried out the machine. (Oh how I wish I had found this video first.)<br />[...]<br />This little 7 minute video will save you HOURS of trial and error trying figure out how to use the dryer component. It is so simple but not clearly explained in the manual.<br /><br />I just got my washer but I have only been able to use my washer for 2 days because of issues which I will go into later after the dust has settled. I have washed approximately 10 loads including a queen size quilt, a double bedspread, and a twin blanket. I love that I can wash blankets and comforters in this machine and they are coming out very nice and clean. I could not do that in my old machine. I have not dried 10 loads (thankfully I have the backup of my old Maytag dryer. which is on a stacking wrack over my new Fagor machine. While I am catching up on lots of laundry and learning HOW the dryer function is going to work best for me. I could NOT have done 10 loads in such a short time period 2- days if I was using the drier component of the washer 100 percent. (maybe once i understand it but not yet) I am doing trial and error trying to figure out how long it takes to dry various loads so having the back up of a dryer has been wonderful. I call it the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Now that my new Fagor washer dryer combo is up and running-- I must say that I am very impressed. I have been using the laundry mat and a friend's fancy Fisher Paykel washer for 3-4 months after my 30 year old Maytag finally bit the dust. I loved my Maytag. It was the top of the line in it's day and it gave me very little problems so I used it until it was pronounced dead and I was very sad to say goodbye. The Fisher Paykel machine that my friend owns, I had helped to research and pick out-- and it was the nicest washer that I had ever used (I admit that I was slightly jealous.) I the Fisher Paykel is a slow washer and that drove me nuts since I was in someone else's house waiting for a load to finish for what seemed like forever, but it got the clothes very bright and clean and I understand that slow is the new modern way of washers and I was going to have to accept that. (Thank goodness, I had a taste of slow washing already because yes this Fagor machine is slow.) Using mostly the old laundry mat for 3 months as I did, my clothes were getting extremely dingy. Stains were NOT coming out and then every now and then I would use the Fisher Paykel machine at my friend's house and my clothes would be noticeably much cleaner with one wash but it could only do so much even with bleach.<br /><br />My first load in the Fagor Washer Dryer Combo was with bated breath, I had spent so much $$ on this machine and I had waited so long for it to arrive. I had run into issues with the wrong hoses being shipped, not fitting, and water squirting everywhere (I will explain that more later) so my first wash load (It took forever to figure out the little manual) I had to go back on line and read what the others here had typed about using the dryer program and it took me a few loads to get the dryer mostly figured out. So when the first load washed on PROGRAM-4 (Which is normal wash- warm- 104 degrees)came out of the washer, the clothes were steaming hot, wet, and they were SO CLEAN. WOW, Oh my gosh, stains were mostly all gone (without using bleach) I have a pair of off white cotton pants that I have worn in the garden and muck all summer which had ground in dirt stains. I had gotten them as clean as I thought was humanly possible with several bleach washings.  Oh my word, the Fagor got most of the stains out (they have only a few light spots left),I bet that those stains WILL come out with a more intense wash program on this machine.<br /><br />I spent a long time trying to figure out the manual, face it, it is written in English but for people who are used to these type of machines. There are missing pieces of key information for Americans-- thank goodness for this sight where we can share our experiences. And the above video.<br /><br />Someone mentioned (I don't know if it was at this site or another site) that their clothes don't shrink. (I think that they must be using the gentle dry cycle. I have not tested that Program for shrinkage yet.) I tested the Normal Hot Program with a pair of Jeans that were a size too big and had been dryed on HOT in 5 different gas and electric dryers since I bought them (I could not shrink them). I was trying to shrink them all summer. Well one trip through the FAGOR Normal Hot Dryer Program, (@170 degrees per a phone call to Fagor Tech support.) I got the clothes bone dry and shrunk those pants in legnth and girth. Maybe I over dried them I am not used to this machine yet and it is hard to guess how long to set the machine to dry. I did something like this with the load that had the jeans (Drier time-- 20 minutes, walk away come back 2 hours later, no not dry yet still very wet, 30 more minutes walk away for 2 hours, no not dry yet, hmm I will try 70 minutes this time or I will never get this load finished.)<br /><br />Something that you CANNOT do with this dryer is dry a little then open the door and pull something out or add another item. I like to dry that way. This machine LOCKS and will not open the door until the inside has cooled to a certain degree before you can open the door. Hence the walking away and forgetting to come back and check on the dryer again for hours. It would be much easier if you could open the door and test for dryness. I guess 170 degrees probably would scald you checking the laundry. But you waste all that heat inside the drum waiting for the load to cool off to pull something out or add something. I will have to learn how long through trial and error that it takes to dry different weights of fabric. Sheets vs towels for example then set the dryer accordingly to pull things out at the point I want to hang them up.<br /><br />There is a Delicate Dry Program which I will try next to determine shrinkage. That may be the way to go with clothes. I don't know how hot the Delicate Dry Program gets that is not in the manual. It is recommended for synthetics. (And these jeans do have a stretch to the material so they probably should have been on the delicate heat because of the strech fabric) I am happy to have shrunk them- but be warned!<br /><br />I have learned that it is well worth adding the extra 10 minutes to have a gentler spin using the Anti Crease Option. Otherwise the clothes are seriously wrinkled and the wrinkles don't hang out when the clothes are hung up wet. Even sheets I will use that Anti Crease option every time from now on. There is also a NO SPIN option for very delicate fabrics and clothes. I have not tested that one.<br /><br />Prior to buying this machine I had asked everyone if they use H.E soap and or bleach and everyone told me NO to both. I asked my trusted repairman and he told me that Bleach wears out the rubber gaskets and things deep in the inner workings of the machines. (He is not familiar with Fagor yet but we did get him signed up to be THE Fagor Repair Specialist because there were none in my state.) He told me use bleach only very sparingly and remember that I need a lot less bleach than with a traditional washer because there is so much less water. He recommends not ever using bleach. Because there is a thin peice of metal (generic washer information) that is part of the spider mechanism that bleach eats. I am using H.E. soap I bought the little measured packs that you toss in the washer with the load of clothes. I am very pleased with H.E. soap (I bought these packets for the laundry mat and it helped get the clothes the cleanest possible in those crappy machines. My repairman told me also that he sees the non H.E. soaps are hard on the inner parts of the front loaders and actually causes them to wear out faster. The dirt floats on top of the old fashioned detergents and therefore float the dirt and soap debri up into areas where it can do damage when it is left behind. He said that the enzymes in those soaps continue to eat at the bearings and that thin piece of metal in the spider of these machines. Amounting to expensive repairs. He recommended using only H.E. soaps in all the front loaders. The Fagor mamual does not mention pros or cons of H.E soap. The repairman told me that also vinegar, and borax are perfectly fine to use in top loader machines-- in general they should do no harm. The same with bleach substitutes.<br /><br />I really like that this machine is very quiet and smooth. It rather purrs like a little cat. This is the quietest washing machine I have ever used. I have it located it my bathroom which is just off my bedroom and in the center of my house. Normally I do not feel the vibration of the machine. But when it is unbalanced then the vibrations increase increase increase. I was sitting on my bed talking on the phone when the load went unbalanced. The machine is new so I didn't know what was happening. (User error I am sure) I laughed so hard as my bed began to vibrate,more and more and more, remember motels with the 25 cent bed vibrators? It was just like that. We used to love those when we were kids. Anyway that is not the regular experience with this washer. And while it was loud it wasn't obnoxiously loud. In fact the old washer made more noise every time I ran it. But I never had a mechanical vibrating bed outside of a cheap motel before. It was hysterical.<br /><br />I will keep coming back to add to this as I am learning more about this machine.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have had my fagor machine for 3-1/2 months. I have done a lot of washing of quilts and dog and cat bedding. I inherited a dog that sheds every minute of the day. So dog hair is on everything. AHHHH! This washing machine has been doing a really good job of getting the hair out of the laundry. I shake it outside before washing and in the past had to wipe down the inside of old washer after washing something hairy and wipe down the inside of the dryer after the same article. I keep all the hairy dog items together for one load. I still shake and keep the dogs items seperated from mine but this dog also gets all of my clothes hairy. So this is a problem for me, I hate hairy clothing! Good news is this washer does a really good job of grabbing the hair into the lint trap. After cleaning a hairy load of laundry the front rubber gasket and the holes where the lint is taken away is all that I have to wipe up with a little rag or thin washcloth, or even a napkin. The inside of the washer typically is NOT hairy after a hairy load. Except if your lint cup is full. Then the washer can't really grab the lint or hair and it gets deposited back on to the clothes.<br /><br />The lint cup: That is my nemesis! I do not like emptying it because there is such a tiny clearance between the machine and the floor that it is impossible to get a towel back under the machine very far. I had emptied it after one week, that was too soon to be of any use a tiny bit of lint was in the cup and it was not worth the cup or two of water that pours out onto the floor so fast that none of my towels are able to absorb it before it is everywhere. (I don't have a sealed floor) I tried it again at the one month point. Still not enough lint to warrant the work and the water mess -- there was just a tiny ball of lint the size of dime and some hair. So I let it go probably about 2 months maybe a little more this time. I had a load with no lint of it's own get covered with lint from the previous load (new wash cloths) and was noticing that it SEEMED like suddenly clothes had more hair on them when they came out than when they went in.<br /><br />Hmmm, it's been a long while since I cleaned out that lint cup...<br /><br />This time I found a piece of hard wood that was left over from an old antique table that was 1-inch high, by 2-inches wide, by 30\" long, I shoved that under the left side of the machine. I was able to tip the machine up and push this under with my foot. That gave me clearance to bunch up a towel under and around the machine to catch the gush of water. This maneuver will need tweaking as there still was too much water for my towel but this was the least mess so far. And the lint cup-- it was packed full of dog hair. The wooden piece from the antique table has a new permanent use to lift the corner of the machine. Now I will hunt for the right size shallow pan to catch the water to shove under the hatch opening for next time.<br /><br />Update it has been about 2 years. I don't like this machine. I can't get the lint out of it I have no idea where it is hiding. I clean and clean the machine and then it deposits lint all over my clothes. I am the laundry queen and I have never had such beat up linty clothes in 30 years of doing wash. At first the machine was not doing this (I wasn't drying much in the beginning but now whether I dry or not this machine seems to beat up my clothes.) I do small loads, increasingly more and more on gentle (which isn't helping much) and I am a careful sorter. Linty things together. So I bought an entire load of sweat pants since I didn't want to wash them with anything else. 4 pairs of black sweat pants. It takes 4 loads of wash to get the black lint out of the machine. And all the black sweats look 90 years old because light colored lint got deposited onto them. The lint seems to become perment balls on the fabric. I am not happy about this. I have a lot of expensive worn out looking clothes that have only been washed on cold and gentle cycle and hung up to dry.<br /><br />It takes forever to dry a load of towels and that is 2 towels, 8 wash cloths 4 dish sponges probably only about 5-7 pounds of laundry. I don't know how you would ever get 13 lbs of dry laundry into this machine. Drying one towel and some washcloths takes hours drying two towels plus smaller stuff I have done 3 or more hours.<br /><br />I loved this machine at first (I chalked any disappointments to a learning curve, that would work itself out and get better) but after almost 2 years I am very disappointed. Cleaning the lint cup takes planning... what I am going to use this time that will be better than last time to divert the water so it doesn't run behind the washer where there is no way to get a towel? After 2 years you'd think I would be a pro at it. NO I still am not!  Tonight was the cleanest ever but I had to use a rug and a bath towel which were both clean and now need to be washed. It is practically an act of God to clean out the lint cup. (I have found myself wasting mental energy re-designing the stupid thing). I finally figured out that I could take the little drop down plastic door off, with it out of the way the job is much easier-- but still not easy. I have less spilled water now with the door out of the way.  Tonight I actually measured the amount of water that came out of the machine during the process, (because I caught most of it this time rather than spilling half of it. There was 4 cups of watered captured. (horrible design) I decided to leave the little plastic door off permanently so that it won't get broken before I decide to move. I will pop it back on and sell this machine with the house.",

The Lux sensor always reads 0 lux.  I have it sitting on my coffee table right now and my house is at 70F according to two different thermometers, and it reports consistently that it's at 78F.  The humidity sensor reports 36% when it's actually 47% currently, though this could be an artifact of the incorrect temperature being reported depending on how the device calculates relative humidity.<br /><br />As a result it's pretty useless for the primary reason I purchased it, as if the 8F error margin stays the same down to freezing (of which there is no guarantee) this thing will be reporting it's 40F in the basement even as my pipes start to freeze.<br /><br />The only sensor that works properly is the motion sensor, and if all I wanted was a motion sensor I'd have bought one for $20+ less than this piece of... equipment.",

It's that thin plastic lip over the glass that provides almost all the structural strength at the center so this isn't a very robust design.<br /><br />It would be pretty easy to create a vertical support in the middle of the front edge of the shelf, between the two drawers. If you do, be sure to spread the load over a large \"foot\" as the plastic fridge lining is very thin.  I took off one star because Frigidaire hasn't improved the shelf but just ships the same design that already failed.",

    "text": "These days, what with the nightmare goings on in places like Flint, Michigan, the concept of drinking ones city water has become of paramount importance and concern.  It's rather sad, since as a little boy I remember the joy of filling a glass of water out of the tap, or best yet drink out of the garden hose, a specially on hot summer afternoons.  Now, you're told not to drink the tap water, and that most garden hoses themselves are full of carcinogen contaminants!<br />I remember, when our own tap water in my city was compromised after a flood, and we were told not to drink the water until it was cleaned up,  I also began to notice that the tap water itself had lost its crystal clean taste.  So we began to get bottled water.  And when I moved from home I continued that practice for many years.  That is, until I began to discover green algae in the bottled water, and found the customer service from this extremely well known company to be virtually nonexistent, and having them claim I was putting the algae in myself, just so they did have to refund me the bottle!  It was then too, that I discovered that most of these bottled water companies are simply pooling their source water from the city itself and sometimes running it through filters.  Point is, these expensive waters did not come from any artesian well or mountain stream!<br />From the days as a boy when we started using bottled water, I always thought, wouldn't it be wonderful if the makers of refrigerators would install water filters and inputs to our water supply, so that we could have cold water and clean pure ice cubes.  I remember on TV there was an external rather “Rube Goldberg” contraption, that sort of did this for you.  But like most things advertise at 3:00 AM on television, it was worthless.<br />That of course, companies like Frigidaire started doing just that.  And, in conjunction with what I think is one of the great inventions of the 20th century: the external water/ice cube dispenser!<br />So why was thrilled when I purchased my first frigid air with both this door dispenser and of course a water filtration system.  I've been using these Frigidaire replacement filters for over 10 years now.  They truly do give you pure great tasting water.  Several years ago, I had a neighbor who actually worked for the Department of Water and Power, in their testing labs, and as a favor he took samples of the water that was run through these filters to test them.  I don't know why I was surprised, but he told me that everything these filters promised to filter out, did indeed do the job.  Comparing the regular water to the filtered water, he said that there was a significant difference.  Not that the city water was anything like Michigan's, but just in the matter of taste and filtration these truly were an improvement.  They are also enormously easy to install, and on the door of the refrigerator is a “status filter light”, that will turn yellow when one needs to reorder, and red when the filter is no longer efficient.  Not sure if this in itself is connected to any kind all of sophisticated calculation, and most likely is timed to go off once a year, but these filters should be replaced once year anyway, so it's just a good reminder.  So for the other Frigidaire owners, I cannot recommend this highly enough.  It arrives quickly, and the price has continued to beat any other online store.",

The difference is rocker vs toggle. Be sure you know which yours is before buying. We ended up purchasing a \"we hope!\" correct one from an online rvparts website.

I thought I was going to have to return them because I thought they were the same as the old pods, but I am actually delighted with the purchase. They are slightly taller and fit perfectly. They far exceed my expectations. In fact, they work in our old coffee maker as well as the newer 2.0 model. Everyone should get these pods. UNIVERSAL and inexpensive. You can't beat that!
