For my particular situation, I was building a countertop to go above my washer and dryer and needed a cleaner solution than the typical 5 inch corrugated aluminum hose. This fit the bill perfectly. Yes, it is aluminum and prone to damage if you are not careful with it, but no more so than the aluminum hose it replaced. In fact it is probably significantly stronger. The only downside I see is that I had to purchase aluminum tape separately so that I could seal the connection points. It did cost more than I was anticipating, but there are a little options for anything similar. I will also say, if you are looking for a significant space saver, temper your expectations. It probably gained me approximately 2 inches (meaning I could move my dryer two inches back further), which is not a lot, but not nothing.",

    "text": "These re-usable K cup filters, made in China, are reported to be 100% BPA, LEAD, and DEHP free. They are purple \"plastic\" with gold mesh bottom and sides. They reportedly fit Keurig 2.0, K200, K250, K300, K350, K400, K450, K500, K550, K560 and all 1. After our K200 broke we checked the Keurig (machine) ratings and then went down to the K-50 because that Keurig seemed to have the highest ratings. These filters fit the K-50 fine. Just fill the filter with coffee, gently snap the filter top closed, place the filter in the Keurig, and press your coffee-maker button(s). You do not need to insert any kind of a paper filter into the items as they themselves are filters!  Open them gently as repeated opening and closing, or forceful opening and closing will eventually result in breakage of the bendable \"plastic\" that functions as a hinge. Although disposable, with gentle care, these filters should certainly last long enough to be worth their cost. Of course, they are not as convenient as using actual K cups because (unless you choose to add paper filters to them), these disposable filters must be emptied of the sticking coffee grounds (which must be scooped out), and then cleaned (which is easy - just swish out in hot soapy water or squirt small amount of liquid detergent in and then turn while under hot kitchen faucet). I would advise supporting the outside of the mesh (with a light pressure) while lightly \"scraping\" the inside mesh to remove the used coffee grounds.  A permanent filter for K coffee makers is more practical because of being easier to clean (not requiring the degree of gentle handling). However, these little disposable ones have their place too!<br /><br />We have an ancient and cheap little coffee pot that we take out on occasion when we want a pot full of coffee, use out regular K cups (including many brands), and now have these disposable filters for when desiring a couple of cups of coffee and needing to consume our older ground coffee, or for when temporarily running out of \"K\" cups. Just as with any brand of little coffee cups for your brewer, the hot water just runs through these little filters holding your coffee. Whether using a \"K\" cup, other brand coffee cup, or these filters, you generally do not get a really strong cup of coffee. For that you need to actually brew your own coffee. However, if you don't have a bold button on your coffee machine and want to get a stronger cup when using these disposable filters ( or \"K\" cups/other brands of coffee-filled cups) you can  use a small gravy ladle to catch the initial and final scoops of coffee water coming out of the coffee maker, and then transfer that less strong coffee to a second (adjacent) cup that can be emptied down your kitchen sink. Sometimes I add the used coffee grounds to my garden soil. K cups and comparable brands are convenient, but it certainly is better for the environment to use either a real coffee pot that brews coffee, permanent \"K\" filters filled with coffee, or disposable filters to which coffee is added.",

    "text": "My Whirlpool range was only a few months old, but our oven stopped heating up right.  Then stopped altogether.<br /><br />The stovetop worked fine, as well as the display.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer, and they kept asking for model numbers, purchase dates, serial numbers, \"did you try this\" - \"did you try that\".....<br /><br />I'm no stranger to DYI and am very comfortable with electronics and electricity in general.  WITH THAT SAID - if you are not comfortable or 100% sure you know what you're doing.... do NOT try to fix this yourself!<br /><br />With that spoiler alert said -  Your stove works on 220V  - 110v is for the stovetop and 110v for the broiler/oven.  Since the top half worked, I knew it had to be the other side of the 220V.<br /><br />I pulled the oven out of the counterspace, and removed the protective cover for where this part is and found that on of the lugs was not put on correctly at manufacture.  I knew it wasn't when the plug was put on, because that part was light, it was the inside lug that the lock nut was not tightened.  For that reason, it was working for awhile, then wasn't making contact, and worked until it got hot, then it separated some, and stopped altogether when the wire burned off.  Again, in my case, the plug from the range to the receptacle was fine, it was the wire from the lug to the oven that burned off.<br /><br />There is only one screw that holds this in place, but you need to be sure that you match the wires from your range to this lug panel, and you have to be sure to put your plug wires in the same place they were in OR you'll have a big problem.  Make sure no wires are loose, and everything is snug.<br /><br />That's it.  Any competent person can change this, but don't try this unless you have your electric off and you are confident in you ability.<br /><br />Anyway, this little part got my $900 range going again, and I didn't have to fight Whirlpool about whether the big box store I bought it from was responsible or them.  The money this cost was worth it getting back to a fully functional appliance again.",

    "text": "What a great deal!!  I know many point out that this doesn't ave the rating to get out all the elements that some filters do, but we're lucking enough that, even though we have well water, our water is pretty good.<br /><br />Even though we're on the Eastern Shore Delaware, and near water, and even have a shallow well, our water is great.  Many people compliment the taste (actually the lack of) our water.<br /><br />With that said, we have a 32cf Samsung French Door refrigerator that uses this cartridge.  After paying $49 every 6 months, I wanted to find a cheaper solution.  I found and purchased these.<br /><br />Since using these filters, I have nothing but positive results.<br /><br />Ice cubes are larger and a glass fills with water faster.  The ice cubes are larger because they mechanism fills like it should instead of timing out before filling with water.  What used to take over 2 minutes to fill a 32oz glass with water now only takes about 20 seconds.  20 seconds!!  This is after 2 service calls on our refrigerator and both ice makers being replaced.  I had checked the service line, and replaced the spigot.  I removed the fill line many times and flushed the line, and had plenty of pressure before in connects to the solenoid on the back of the unit.<br /><br />After replacing the filter with these, we now have the ability to fill our water glasses FAST.",

Holds way more clothing than I thought it would!  I don't fill it up all the way.  For example, no more than 2 large towels at a time, however it will hold more. I love that there is no timer on it.  You can run it for as long as you want.  Just don't forget that its running!! It's so quiet! Ha ha!  Also it is very light! easy to move and store.  I have been looking at this item and others like it for over a year.  I wish I would have bought it sooner!  For me, it was expensive, but worth every penny!!!

    "text": "So I just got this and I have only used it a few time so far but I am really liking this. You have to go slow when press it down but the coffee comes out really clean. It does leave some coffee behind with the grounds but that is the stuff under the screen. The plunger goes all the way down but the design of the press leaves room at the bottom under the screen so you don't squeeze the grounds. With the original stainless screen coffee and fine grounds can still flow through. The coffee wont flow through this screen. Only the liquid that is forced through it when it was pushed down can be poured off. So you do &#34;lose&#34; some coffee. For the numbers people. I started with 35 grams of fine coffee (melitta). I know you should courser grind but I was out of my whole bean and I wanted to put this to a harder test for the 1st time. I added 550 grams of hot water for the roughly 15:1 ratio and let it steep for 4 minutes. I pressed it trying to go at the recommended 45 seconds. I poured off the coffee. It wasn't as clear as going through a filter screen but it was pretty clear.The coffee tasted great and there was almost nothing in the bottom of the cup when I finished. What was left in the bottom of the press was 163 grams of watery grounds. So I got about 422 grams of drinkable coffee. Not bad. There a little more loss with this filter but I think it's worth it. Worth it for a clean cup and not having to worry about getting a mouth full of silt and leaving coffee behind in the cup instead of the press.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />So I've made about 20 pots of coffee with this and I'm still using the 1st filter. It is a little brown color now but still seems to be working fine. I have been cleaning it with Oxiclean and that seems to be working great. After cleaning it isn't white again but only slightly tan. I put hot water in the press with some oxiclean and push the plunger up & down a few time and then let it soak for a while and then repeat the process with clean water. I have got my blend for coffee and water pretty down. I put 55 grams of coffee in the press and then fill it with just boiled water which is about 900 gram of water. After steeping for 4 minutes I press the coffee and I get 785 grams of coffee. That leaves me with 170 grams of wet grounds in the bottom of the press. These ground are not soupy. It seems to be just about the perfect amount under the plunger. Works very nice for me. I really like this and can highly recommend it.",

    "text": "We purchased all of our appliances in September, 2007. We started having issues with the ice maker & it would stop allowing water to come out the front about 6 months ago. Although I figured the water was freezing, I looked at my filter sheet in the utility room & noticed we never replaced the filter for our GE Fridge, so 8 years, 5 1/2 months was way over due. I ordered a 3-pack of these filters on Saturday March, 19th, 2016 & received the package on Monday, March, 21st, 2016. Not bad at all. As it says on the instructions, I used tap water to partially fill the filter, let it sit for about 2 minutes, added a bit more tap water, installed the filter & ran about 1 1/2 gallons of water, just to make sure there wouldn't be charcoal particles left in the line. The filter works great. As for the taste, I can't tell the difference between bottled water, or our household water supply.<br />The Refresh Filter Model Number R-9991 works with our GE Side By Side Refrigerator. This model doesn't have the O-Rings on it. The O-Rings are on the Unit where the Filter fits onto. [They only make the two types, with/without O-Rings]. They need a side shot so you can see how the top looks. I believe I looked at another seller who had the side shot but this seller had the best price, plus Prime, so shipping was free, 2-day shipping. Next, I'll be buying a Brita Water Filter Pitcher, along with the Faucet Mount Water Filter. 1st I'm buying Test Strips to see how bad our Waterford, MI. Well Water is, & how bad the bottled water we've been using is. Back to our Fridge, the water taste's great.<br />I am going to get test strips because of a video short my daughter sent to me on facebook all about bottled water & the readings that a mom got on 8 different brands. Along with a 1 gallon container with filters in side of it, we can further clean our tap water. Trust me, I was shocked to see what the readings that were on 6 of the major brands sold throughout the US. All in all, our water at least tastes great now. These filters do the job & our ice maker & water dispenser works normal again.",

    "text": "Great tasting water. Identical to the taste from the (much more expensive) Frigidaire OEM filter.<br /><br />Basically, that's all there is to say. This filter looks pretty much identical to the OEM one (the cap on mine was white instead of blue), and the filtration qualities are identical to it. After running a couple gallons through (necessary for any new filter), the taste coming out is fresh and clean just like the OEM's was when new.<br /><br />-- UPDATE --<br /><br />Eight months later, the filter stopped working rather suddenly. We had clean well-filtered water coming through here for just a little over eight months of heavy use by a family of eight who drink a lot of water. Note that eight months is longer than the recommended six-month replacement interval (I missed my phone alarm to change it...), so no complaints on longevity. The sudden change to unfiltered water is actually kind of nice, rather than a slow descent into unfiltered-tasting water; it very clearly reminded me that I'd &#34;slept through&#34; that alarm a few months back! I would recommend buying a multi-pack to have extras on hand in case your usage causes it to stop working before six months is up, and change it at six months regardless (I didn't do that on last purchase because I was suspicious that the much-cheaper filter might not perform as well as the OEM, but now I reordered a three-pack and will keep at least one on hand at all times).",

I had used this brand of filter before for a Cuisinart coffee maker and they were great. K & J was not the cheapest replacement, but I felt better trying them. No real complaints, I only gave them a 4 star rating rather than a five because while the filters are approximately the same size as the original they do contain less filtering material. This makes for a little less than a snug fit into the assembly and probably a little less actual filtering. We will likely change out the filter a little more often in this case.",

    "text": "We bought this fridge about two weeks ago, and we really love it.<br /><br />1. It's enormous and holds a ton of stuff. It also feels like a very high-quality product. The doors are like 4&#34; thick, and when you open them, it feels like you're opening the vault at a bank.<br /><br />2. It's versatile. In addition to having adjustable shelves (as most fridges do), this fridge has two very helpful &#34;flip&#34; shelves that enable you to store tall items easily. Also, the deli drawer has a cool adjustable compartment and independently adjustable temperature controls.<br /><br />3. We totally love the deli drawer, and it's the primary reason that we chose this product over others. We used the deli drawer a lot in our previous (Kenmore Elite) refrigerator. It's great to be able to access stuff in the deli drawer without having to open the fridge. Also, in most fridges, the deli drawers are made of relatively flimsy molded plastic, whereas this deli drawer has the vault-esque qualities as mentioned above.<br /><br />4. It's quiet. It's way, way quieter than the Kenmore Elite refrigerator that we replaced (and relegated to the garage as a beer fridge). On Consumer Reports, this fridge gets a &#34;very good&#34; rating for noise, which is shy of an &#34;excellent&#34; rating. The problem with buying a fridge is that they aren't plugged in at the store, so you have no way to compare the noise and actual functionality of the products. But, I'd be surprised if there's any fridge on the market that's noticeably quieter than this one, as this one is really dang quiet.<br /><br />5. We also like the sparkling water feature, and we've been using it quite a bit. That said, people, don't buy this refrigerator &#34;for&#34; the sparkling water feature -- or if you do, hedge your expectations a bit. This product is *not* a soda fountain or a Coca-Cola bottling factory with a refrigerator attached to it. Rather, it's a *refrigerator* that has a little sparkling water *feature.* I know that Samsung is really overhyping this feature, and because of that, it didn't meet many people's expectations and those people are now ranting about it. Ultimately, it's fine and it's a nice convenience, nothing more and nothing less. We lucked out, and we got this refrigerator for an amazing price, and for even less money than the model that does not include the sparkling water. So, for us, the sparkling water is just a bonus. If we hadn't got this refrigerator for such a great price, we would've likely opted for the model that does not include the sparkling water and saved a little money. I wouldn't have paid an extra $150-ish for the sparkling water.<br /><br />Bottom line, so far, after about two weeks of use, I really don't have anything bad to say about this fridge. My one word of advice, however, is to measure the area where you'll put this fridge very carefully and make sure that you give yourself about 1/2&#34; of leeway to accommodate the published width of this product. When I took the measurements at our house, we &#34;should have&#34; had about 1/4&#34; of wiggle room for the fridge. However, when we actually installed the fridge, it was a smidge wider than the published dimensions, and it just barely fit in our space. I was sweatin' it....<br /><br />Good luck with your purchase.",

A couple of times I found an undissolved packet but found if I run the hot water in the sink a few times during the auto cycle there's no problem.  I'm learning to deal with the bad rack design and can load it quicker.  Gave it 3 stars this time.<br /><br />Original post:  I didn't get this thru Amazon because another store had a good sale and they had it installed.  We were replacing a 13 year old Maytag.  I'll just mention that we had problems initially due to the installers not balancing it and when we finally got it adjusted we thought Yippeeee now we can have clean dishes! Nope! So here are some facts about this GE non-dishwasher. And I have pix showing the mess!<br />THE PROBLEMS: The recommended detergent packets don't dissolve leaving a cement hard residue and the gel just slimes everything!  And the dishes are still dirty!<br />WHAT I'VE TRIED:<br />1. Increased the water heater to 125 degrees plus I use the Wash Temp Boost option.<br />2. I've tried all of the cycle options also and still the PROBLEMS persist.<br />3. Due to its poor design, with one of the utensil holders right in front of the detergent dispenser, I spend too much time arranging the dishes and utensil so I'm not blocking it! I hang a lot of utensils from the wine glass holder on the top rack and place very few on the bottom<br />4. Since there are 2 water sprayers for the top rack and just one at the bottom for the lower rack so I have to make sure I don't even put smaller bowls in the lower row close to the detergent dispenser!<br />5. I literally have to soak and wash everything before putting them in the DW.  My next step will be to just hand wash and use the DW as a drying rack!<br />So RIP old Maytag, I wish I could resurrect you!",

Nasty! I understand the Miami Dade, FL, Water Management* is adding additional chlorine for a short period, and they must have started today. Ordinarily, I do not taste chlorine in the filtered water. Test fail.<br /><br />(*) “Temporary change in water chlorination process underway— Sunday, Nov. 8 and continues through Saturday, Nov. 21. “During this period, County residents may notice a chlorine taste or smell in their tap water. This is a temporary condition that will not cause any adverse health effects... However, dialysis patients, owners of tropical fish, and managers of restaurants and stores with fish holding tanks are advised to seek professional advice.”<br /><br />Original review:  The usual water purifier brand that I order doubled in price. I'm really glad I ordered this brand! It has all of the filtering features I look for, and at a price that is within my budget. Allows great water flow. Thank you for holding the price steady! Instructions say to run the water for x-amount of gallons. I did not need to run water for more than one minute to get rid of the air bubbles created by changing filters.

    "text": "UPDATED REVEW: Reordered today, DEC 31, 2017. The refrigerator's red warning light is flashing, which lets me know it's time to change the filter. I'm happy my initial purchase lasted almost 12 months. It's diffcult to know how many gallons of water the unit filtered within this time, but this is a one member household. I can say that I drink no less than 8 pints (1 gallon) of water a day. My head would explode if I tried to calculate the resulting math figures. I will update this update (😁) if the new filter does not perform as well as the initial one purchased.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW (2016):  Excitedly happy with this brand, Waterdrop. The previous filter greatly reduced the water flow. Waterdrop was easy enough to install, and the water dispenser now has great flow! I do not see how many gallons this is supposed to filter. If it lasts as long as it should, 9-12 months, I will certainly purchase again. This came in a durable plastic bag, no box (as pictured). Clueless as to exactly what the filter helps with, but my drinking water seems fresher or I'm imagining things—not sure which. This product replaces my refrigerator specifications, indicated as Maytag UKF8001.",

We also lucked out and saved about a couple of bucks buying them when we did as they are now higher in price but still much less than buying from other appliance parts websites.",

    "text": "Not exactly a simple install, because this sensor was physically different than the original.<br /><br />First, it was missing the clear plastic sheath, and with thick fixtures on each end, there was no simple way to use the old one. So I cut the old wires, and removed that sheath, then use scissors to slice it lengthwise. Then I carefully fed the new wires into the old sheath, using tie wraps every few inches to secure it.<br /><br />Next problem- this new sensor is about a foot longer than OEM. I suppose that's a lot better than being too short! I carefully bound the excess away from the tubing on the plug end and tie wrapped it.<br /><br />Had the new one been the same length, with the sheath, maybe a 10 minute job. With these issues - more like 30. But as long as it works...<br /><br />The good news - the plug end worked as it should- remove the red clip and this one pops in.",

    "title": "Replaced Jenn-Air",
    "text": "This GE range was a replacement for a Jenn-Air CVE1400/4180/4210/4270 series downdraft for which we could no longer easily get parts. If you are considering the same swap, then you'll probably find challenges lining up with the existing duct-work. The required opening is the countertop is almost identical, the GE requiring 5/8&#34; less distance from front to back and just 1/16&#34; less side to side. So it slips into the old aperture easily, and with sufficient overlap that there are no gaps. The outlet to the ducting is 7/8&#34; more to the right and 1-7/16&#34; further to the back than the Jenn-air, which isn't much but enough to cause problems because the fan box (plenum) on the GE is considerably longer, at a distance of 6-3/8&#34; lower than the Jenn-Air. Added to that is the need for a 10&#34; x 3-1/4&#34; rectangular to 6&#34; round transition adapter, which is longer than the required Jenn-Air 5&#34; round to 6&#34; round transition, all in all coming almost to the bottom of a standard cabinet, which leaves very little room to crank over toward the old duct-work.<br /><br />For me, the ducting was by far the most difficult and time consuming part of the install. When I later noted that the Amazon price for installation is $180, I thought that it was a great deal. Then looking at, &#34;What's included with service&#34; there is no mention of the duct-work. If you choose this option I advise checking with the installer.<br /><br />When installing the GE range you alternate between thinking, &#34;this was thoughtful design&#34; to, &#34;why didn't they just do this to make it easier&#34;. For example, when fitting the fan box you see an apparently useless hole in the top of the range cavity but you soon realize that it happens to line up with a dimple in the fan box that together mean that the weight of the box is supported while you install the fixing screws; good thinking. On the other hand, the first operation is placement of an adhesive foam gasket seal around the periphery of the underside of the glass top, and while doing this you wonder why the customer has to fit this, and not GE. The electrical box is attached with 2-screws, one at the back that is really hard to get to and one at the front for which your screwdriver will be difficult to access should your cabinet have a central divider. There seems no good reason why this box could not have been retained by screws to the sides. The instructions say that the electrical box takes a ¾&#34; conduit, but mine had a hole for a 1&#34; conduit, which could be a nuisance if you're not prepared.<br /><br />The GE range itself looks very sleek on the counter and so far has operated just as advertised. There is, however, room for improvement. There is only a single light to indicate that a heated element is on, but to see which requires checking the position of each control, which on our black control knob on black surface range, isn't that easy. There are, however, &#34;Hot Surface Indicator Lights&#34;, one for each side that remain on after switch-off as long as the glass on that side remains hot. The indicator to show if the front left control is on front-burner only, or front-burner and bridge, is a minute rectangle which is either filled or open, and is very hard to see.<br /><br />At the time of writing we are scared to death of spilling anything just in case it spoils the looks forever. I think that this range's surface is going to need a lot more cleaning than that of its predecessor, just like our granite countertops and stainless steel fridge. Progress? Form over function?",

However, I found they could be used to replace the harder to obtain (especially as a kit together with the axle/clip) back rollers.<br /><br />The 2 back rollers, WD12X10267, are narrower and once the center of the wheel and/or the axle wear, they wobble and fall off the track. The wider front rollers each take less load (because there are 4 of them) and don't so readily fall off the track both because they wear less and aren't so narrow.<br /><br />To stop the back of the rack falling off the track, I moved 2 of the front wheels (WD12X271) to the back and they worked fine. Maybe because they, like the rear rollers, had worn somewhat, they were able to move a little to fit into the slightly tighter body dimension at the back. Once the new WD12X271 axles arrived I replaced the front rollers I had moved. Now the dishwasher has 6 wide lower rollers and the bottom rack moves in and out with no problem at all.",

I am a little worried about the other 3 we have of the same model in our other bathrooms.  This swap out was very easy though.  Unplugged the light plug and removed the light.  Unplugged the fan and eased the whole unit out.  Put the new replacement fan motor with housing in without a problem. Plugged everything back in and it works perfectly. Hopefully it lasts.  I'm guessing the old motor may have had a total of less than 100 hours use in 5 years. This replacement isn't cheap but I'm glad to know when the other ones die I can easily fix them.",

I can't say that we make a lot of baked goods but the oven seems to cook evenly and hold the temps properly.  We have our range top running on LP and they run very hot.  Two tips:  Get good cookware that has a good thick bottom to distribute heat evenly. And you can adjust the knobs after starting the range by lowering the gas below the markings to get a good simmering flame to cook on when necessary.  It would be nice if the knobs were not plastic but I haven't tried to locate suitable replacements yet. This range is a very good buy for the price.",

SAME RESULTS.<br />The technique used by real Keurig Carafe pods can not be replicated with reusable filters, since the original Pod uses a completely TRAPPED ground coffee, and a long water distributor inside of it, so the flow of water is totally forced evenly into it.  The water has Not an easy way to come out bypassing the grounds of coffee.  In this product, grounds of coffee get soaked with the first seconds of water, which is fine and it gives you a few seconds of black coffee, then the rest of the water coming out is completely clear, as the soaked coffee grounds get compacted and accumulated at the half-bottom of the Eco-Carafe.<br /><br />If other users claim that they are fine, maybe they are using it just for a small cup of coffee and very strong coffee grounds, or simply don't mind a weak coffee.  But in my case, I feel this item does Not provide good results for brewed coffee in a CARAFE.<br /><br />Good try but impractical for those who want to save money from buying original pods, and still wanting a good and strong cup of coffee from a 3-4 cups sized Carafe.",

    "text": "Great looking range hood.<br /><br />Unfortunately it arrived with a small dent which fortunately will be hidden by installation. Packaging not thick enough for adequate protection for gorilla/drop-kick shipping cos. and handling between manufacturer and US consumer.<br /><br />Mounting instructions were minimal and incorrect - as was the mounting planning design by the designers. I had to disassemble the lower under side of the range hood (10 screws with poor alignment when reassembled) to access the four top screw slot mounting points so it could be attached to the cabinets above securely. The corner/side mounts will not be useable if the hood is to be mounted between cabinets as in my case. The mounting screw slots in the top of the hood shell are too thin (screws bent metal while trying to mount) to support the weight of the hood without additional 1\" fender washers on the mounting screws to spread the load. There is no way to access the mounting screws (without disassembly) and mounting screws included are too short -1/2\"- for secure wood cabinet mounting and I substituted 3/4\" pan). Clearly, the designers were not familiar with or did they consider the typical American in-between kitchen cabinets mounting location for range hoods.<br /><br />The halogen lights on the range hood put out a lot of light at the front of the cook surface, but get very hot - as in do not touch. They should have been tilt-able LEDs and I will probably replace them - as soon as I am over the excessive installation effort. Additionally, mine are focused to far to the front of my KitchenAid range to cover the cooking area and probably of most ranges. Still, my stove is better lighted than before.<br /><br />While the UGA ad says that the noise level is 65db at 900 cfm - it is probably at least that and likely more, and it doesn't significantly diminish between the different fan speeds as I was hoping. While it is the most powerful range hood (most range hoods are 180-300 cfm - compared to 900cfm for the UGA) I have ever seen (actually blows the leaves around on trees 20 feet away on the outside discharge) - it is also the LOUDEST at any speed. You may want ear protectors while cooking and conversation will be almost impossible unless the person is standing immediately next to you and your ear - and shouting. If your goal is to get have an attractive range hood and to get cooking fumes and smells out of your house - this range hood will do it. However, be prepared for an unpleasant noise level - (that IMO with some minor engineering design changes [different bearings, vibration isolation fan motor mounts, fan intake baffles and a lower fan speed range] could have been mostly avoided).<br /><br />In summary: It is a very attractive design IMO, but be prepared to spend some unexpected planning time, effort and a lot of frustration on installation. Don't forget to also order your ear protectors at the same time.",

It states on the box it is only for 1-4 cups. The box has some very stilted english, so I wouldn't use it as a gift. The filter works really well! I wasn't sure the coffee was even running down the outside of the filter on my first brew, so I touched it and sure enough it works exactly like it's supposed to! Even better, aside from the not wasting paper, is that with the stainless steel wires that support the filter you are able to see right down into the cup or carafe so you know when to stop pouring the water! Clean up is easy too. You can simply rinse it between uses rather than take out the soap. Coffee doesn't get a plastic taste.  We drink from a 10-12 cup chemex carafe usually because we drink a lot of coffee, but if it's just me, or someone is visiting who only will drink one cup in the afternoon, I use this!

I then let it set for 12 hours and then place my drink dispenser below it and release all the coffee. There is never any grinds or fine sludge at the bottom! You can't beat these very well made filters! I have used mine for over a year. It rinses out easily(we save the grinds for our garden). I found the best way to clean these after multiple uses, especially since the oils in the coffee will stick to the filter and build up , is to boil them. I do it several times and rinse and you will be amazed how clean these can get. Do not use bleach or any soap to clean as this will leave a residue of taste no matter how thoroughly you think you rinse them!",

This complaint also goes back about 5 years.. if indeed it was dangerous, likely we would have heard something by now. In addition, I find a lot of complaints when installed but not so much after a year or so. In fact I could not find a review where someone had it for 2 years and was still complaining. I did find a few that said the smell fades. For me I have had it 2 weeks and the only time i can smell it is when I have done a high heat wash and immediately opened the door. I can't even smell it on normal.  I absolutely can't smell it on my dishes. And once the product cools down I can't smell it at all in the dishwasher. I am confident it will fade.<br /><br />The product works very well. I have sparkling dishes and an easy to use product. Finally it has a ton of room.",

I don't have a calibrated standard but it is within 1 degree of measured with another digital gauge. This is good enough for my application. I have it installed behind the tv stand and it emits a pleasant backlight that lends itself well to behind the tv. It seems robust in a commercial housing. Setup was relatively easy-connect the device via USB to your PC and under networks click on the \"ppC…\" network and log off your normal connected wifi network. Type in the \"192...\" URL and the rest is intuitive. Allow the device a few minutes to initialize and reboot. Disconnect from the PC when successful, reconnect to your normal wifi network, install the device in your chosen location and download the app on your smart phone. Away you go!",

Honestly I bought it because it wasn't glass (bad for camping) and because it is dishwasher safe (when I use it at home). My only problem is that it says it's dishwasher safe, but for top rack only & it's too tall to go on my top rack.

    "text": "LG provides a 1-year warranty for this fridge.  I've owned mine for 2 years now, so wanted to provide some insights.<br /><br />As I mentioned in the title, the entire width of the fridge is spacious and accommodates just about anything you want to refrigerate.  The top shelf is closest to the vent from the freezer, so liquids tend to freeze (yes, even though you can set the fridge and freezer compartment temps to the exact degree).  Butter, guacamole, and things like that do well up there.<br /><br />One minor complaint is that you must open both doors to access the full-width meat tray at the bottom and keep those doors out of the way while operating the tray.<br /><br />My biggest complaint are the door gaskets.  No fridge is worth a thing if it can't keep the cold air in!  Now, there is an alarm that goes off if the doors are left open for a period of time.  The problem is that the doors have to be noticeably open.  The freezer drawer was my first indication of weak magnetic gaskets.  Even though you push in the drawer and it sounds like it's closed, you need to give an extra push just to be sure.  Otherwise, you'll return to your freezer to find the contents frosted over!  Trust me!<br /><br />The ultimate complaint is with the right door.  It's *very* challenging to keep this door secured!  The alarm won't go off if the door is slightly ajar.  The magnetic gasket on the right side is noticeably weaker than the left-hand door.  It feels like it's gotten weaker over time.  It takes *very* little force with just one finger to open the door!  This door will fail to seal if you just close the door and walk away (the air pressure inside seems to not let the gasket seal).  Also, closing the left hand door can create air pressure that pops the seal on the right door.  Either way, the right door sticks out about half an inch, allowing cold air to leak out and more compressor run-time, I'm sure.  So, I'm *constantly* checking and re-checking the right door!  With kids in the house, forget it!  I've looked closely at the gasket and it is not damaged and it makes full contact all the way around, but it's just *super* weak!<br /><br />A replacement gasket is roughly what I would pay American Homeshield to come out and replace it, so I'm setting up an appt. now with them.  I'm sure they'll just have an identical gasket available, but I'd *love* to get one that has a stronger magnet.  Not holding my breath!",

Mechanically there have been issues with the hinge point, but that is to be expected with our severe use. Electronically I do not believe we have had a single failure! I highly recommend this product.<br />NOTE: A few people have mentioned that they strip out the screw heads when trying to replace the heating element.  The screws are Phillips head screws... The primary reason a Phillips head screw strips is because people don't understand you need to use the correct size screwdriver, i.e., don't use a #3 Phillips driver in a fastener having a #1 Phillips head! In reality, it's difficult to strip out a Phillips screw head IF you are using the CORRECT SIZE DRIVER. When somebody says \"every single screw head stripped out\"... you can bet the person thinks that Phillips are One-Size-Fits-All. Same thing goes for a standard slotted screw! With Torx head and Allen head, people seem to understand whether or not the tool fits correctly... It's just not as obvious with Phillips and slotted.",

I finally was told by a GE technician that a corrosion on a part caused the problem because the electronic panel is not sealed to prevent moist and water getting in.  GE refused to admit that it is a design flaw or manufacturing defect.  A GE customer service associate once told me that NE coasts in America are full of salty air which cause the corrosion and of course it is ridiculous.  The problem is corrosion takes time to develop and you have to catch it in the first year, or you need to buy a new one again, and or you buy an extended warranty.",

To everyone out there, if you're going to by a top load washer make damn sure you get one with a full action agitator.

Front load washers do pretty good, but leak and just break down too much, and the cost to keep them up can be heartbreaking.  If you just don't want a washer with an agitator, then your best bet is a front load washer, just do your homework and checkout the reviews and feedback before buying.  Best wishes: Rick Warton",

I suggest you get your phone number in on the order somewhere when you place the order. Worked out for me and I was up and washing in 30 minutes.

The burners are slow to light and they constantly need adjusting. The oven (which I rarely use) is the worst disappointment. A month ago, the oven igniter went out; that cost $200 to repair. A few nights ago, I turned on the broiler for the first time ever,  and after a minute or so, something popped--enough to force the oven door open several inches--with me standing right in front of it. Tonight, I tried to start the oven; this time the popping seemed to come from the panel. It popped again, and the readout panel went dark. I reset the house circuit breaker, but the stove would not come on. None of the electrics now work, including, of course, the igniters. I will not repair this range.

    "text": "I so agree with the other reviews about the slow ice maker.  I thought at first I'd return for this reason, but my calm husband said give it time to work and fill up.  It doesn't hold as many ice cubes as our old Amana held but it did finally fill up.  When we use a lot of ice, it's important to keep hitting the freezer button so it'll hurry up and make more.  I do like that the ice cube maker is in the door instead of the highest shelf in the freezer, frees up a lot of room.<br /><br />We hadn't been used to energy saving, our old Amana was 22 yrs old and nothing wrong with it, just the wrong color, changed from white kitchen appliances to stainless steel, so the refrigerator part of this Samsung needs constant attention to make sure it stays cool enough.  I guess it defaults back to 36 or 38 degrees so I've gotten used to hitting the fridge button so it'll cool back down to 34.  It's true about the height of the shelves, a gallon jug wouldn't fit without removing shelves, but we switched to organic milk months ago and they only come in half gallons so we don't have the problem with gallon containers.  The milk and the juice in the door aren't as cool as our Amana kept them, but the Amana had a door that slid down over the containers and that kept them cooler, but I just keep adjusting the temps to go to 34 so everything will stay cooler.<br /><br />It's a beautiful fridge so that means a lot and I do love the lights inside.  I don't mind the drawers not opening all the way.  I just keep fresh veggies and fruits in there so it's not hard to reach for them without the drawer coming all the way out.  The wine rack is awesome and the fridge overall has a lot of room even though it's counter depth.  I appreciated the extra space, plus most everything I store for awhile in there I keep in oxo pop containers and it looks quite beautiful when I open the door.  My neighbor said it looks like a 'staged' refrigerator :-)",

It is pretty durable, I have it laying on the floor of my truck and my daughter steps on it all the time to get into her car seat and it still hasn't cracked or broken.  It's come in handy while out shopping when there's no bathroom in sight, as well as on long trips when we need to pull over to the side of the road and let her go.  My only issue with it is that the two sides where you store the plastic bags is so hard sometimes to open up.  If my daughter waited until the last minute to tell me she had to go, I struggle to open the side compartments to pull out a bag, I don't know if there's some kind of trick to it but it sticks a lot. You're better off to just keep a plastic bag already set up and snapped into the lid so it's all ready to go when you need it.  Also, she is now 4 years old, she's a little small for her age, but I can see she's going to outgrow it pretty soon, I think it works best for under 4 years of age.",

I actually don't prefer to use a coffee maker just because I am the only one who drinks coffee in my household and my coffee maker never brews a good cup of coffee if it is just one or two cups. I don't mind k-cups but you can't customize those like you can with this! I also like grinding my beans fresh sometimes so this has worked out perfectly for me. You can really customize the strength of your brew with this pour over filter.<br /><br />This is stainless steel with a superior filter! I can't stress that enough here this filter is really a good quality and very fine mesh. I have had no residue at the bottom of my cup from the grounds and zero stray grounds in my Coffee.<br /><br />Really easy to keep clean! I just rinse mine after each use with my sink sprayer until the water comes out clear and dry in the dish rack, so simple. Much easier than cleaning out my coffee maker. I actually never feel like my coffee maker is clean enough so this is a content feeling knowing that this is so easy to clean. You could also soak or wash with vinegar if you really want a good clean with this.<br /><br />This would be perfect for traveling or a camping trip as it needs no power! Economically friendly.<br /><br />It simply rests on top of a regular sized  Coffee cup or thermos, for a wider cup you will have to hold it and it comes with a handle area to do so. You just pour you hot water right over your grounds in a circular motion until your cup is full! It's as easy as pie! I love it!<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I really have tested and used this product and all of my opinions stated here are based on my actuall experience with it.",

I don't use my freezer ice anymore.  Purchased to supplement on hot days when we had people over.  I now run it all the time.  Only recommendation is to set the electronic eye in the middle of the ice tray.  Ice tends to melt towards the front so it does not make more ice until ice in the back of the bin starts to melt.  Ice is always fresh tasting since the ice storage area is not below freezing.  This is a great ice maker for the price.  Nightly recommend.",

I bought a kitchen suite of GE products; fridge, dishwasher, microwave and oven. The dishwasher broke in less than 30 days and I had to fight with GE to get it replaced.  Then by Christmas, they microwave completely died and I don't use my microwave often and only to heat things up.  Then the fridge...where to even begin??  Even my stove went.<br /><br />If you are stuck with GE, try to get rid of it ASAP.  If this part is broken...good luck.  Like me you will be better off buying a Norwex water pitcher.  That's what I'm doing.  GE, you are AWFUL!! This product here is AWFUL!!!!",

    "text": "I built my home from the ground up so my review is for the DIYer with some experience. This hood is real nice looking.  It is not 304 stainless.  I installed this one in my outdoor kitchen over the grill. It installs by hanging it like you would a microwave oven but is is somewhat flimsy.  Meaning it moves if you touch it. Say if your cleaning the hood it will move.  If you take the grills out it is very simple. Hood, motor, and the electronic box.<br /><br />If I were to have installed this in my house I would not by real happy because of how easily it moves.  It hangs on a 10&#34; x 1.5&#34; bracket then rests on 2 rubber bumpers where the lights are.  If your wondering if it could fall down it wont. Like one reviewer said it looks great from 5 feet.  Heck it looks great at 2 feet but as soon as you begin to explore it you can tell its not a stellar product.  But lets not forget this is 200.00.  I am very impressed with how it looks. There are no visible screws and the hood is one piece. It is no louder than my microwave fan and the lights to some my be misplaced but they cast a real nice light on the backsplash.  The flues are 2 18&#34; pieces.  It comes with everything to vent into your attic.  I spent 50.00 to vent it outside.<br /><br />To install it it must be pretty much put together. Attach the flex tube, attach the bottom flue and position the riser flue in place.  Pre-peal all the protective film off and make marks on the wall where the bracket is. Remove the screens and grab it by the motor.  Did i mention to mark on the wall where the bracket is?  After it is hung there is a 3/8&#34; gap all around, including up the flue so the top bracket that holds the riser flue in place must be on a 3/8&#34; stand-off.  It is not in the instructions.  Please remember this because it in not easy to do after the fact.  I see some reviewers stayed away from the plastic wall anchors.  they are long and i don't think there a good choice for drywall.  i don't think your should mount this on drywall.  Meaning try to hit at least one furring strip.  If not i would cut out the drywall and bolt on a piece of wood. But that's my opinion.  I like to do things once if i can.<br /><br />In summary I now have a hood where there once was none.  If it breaks I purchased the 2 year warranty. after that I don't see anything inside this hood that i could not fix myself.",

    "text": "I am new to kegorators so this will be helpful to anyone having concerns about the unit performing as intended. First 1/2 1/4 kegs will fit.  The 1/4 kegs can be tall or short.  The short ones may be housed in black rubber. They will fit tightly but must be raised about 6 inches so the door closes. But try to avoid the rubber cased kegs.<br /><br />Customer Service:<br />I had to call customer service.  yes a few screws were missing.  I had no problem reaching someone and they had them to me in just a few days.  The operator knew the product and knew what to send.  She helped me register it too.<br /><br />Beer Kegs and hookup<br />A 1/4 keg of beer cost about 90.00 so let it be the last thing you buy.  (Or you might end up in Reviewer Lisa's situation. Sorry Lisa.) Set up the fridge first. Even though the directions are not crystal clear you can hook up the hoses without a problem just don't rush.  There are o-rings you may or may not need.  My suggestion is to look at the fittings that screw together.  If there is no o-ring then add one.  Mine had all o-rings in place.  the ones in the bags were probably extras. When hooking up hoses i did not use the plastic hose clamps instead i used steel micro clamps.  I used Teflon on the screw on parts and if it had a nut i used a wrench.<br /><br />Run the fridge at 1/2 temp for about 2 days.  If it dies with a keg in it you just lost about 40.00.<br /><br />Fill your co2.  Welding shops, Fire extinguisher service, ect. will charge the tank for about 15.00.<br /><br />Hook up your co2 and regulate it to 8 psi. Yes you can hook this up without a keg attached.  The regulator is adjusted with a screw.  After you have tightened everything including the co2 tank turn off flip valve leading to keg, Turn the adjusting screw counter clockwise until it stops. Open co2 tank valve all the way.  The gauge on left is for tank capacity. It will read GOOD (or be in the green area) SLOWLY adjust the screw clockwise until it reads 8psi. It has a nut on it so lock it down to keep the screw setting. Now open the flip valve to the keg. Now test for leaks with soapy water. Wait a few mins and re-adjust tank pressure if needed.<br /><br />Turn up fridge to full<br />Go get Keg. No rubber!<br /><br />Open fridge and tap keg.  The handle on the tap will be locked in the up position. Locate and line up pins on keg with nipples on tap. Push down and turn to lock.  Unlock the tap to release beer by pulling out handle and pushing down then back in. place keg in fridge.<br /><br />Wait!  about 20-30 mins.  Yes go take a shower you have worked up a sweat.<br /><br />Serve beer. the first 3-5 glasses will have some foam but after that you should be good to go.<br /><br />Now if you need additional help the fellas at your beer store may tell you all you keen to know.<br /><br />My fridge ran for about 12 hours after adding the keg so i opened the door and lowered it till it shut off.  Beer is very cold.<br /><br />AVOID<br />Beer line touching cold plate. it will freeze, you will panic and blame you momma. I did not do that.  I warmed up the lines with hands and life went on.<br />Rubberized kegs.  They look cool but will not fit well.<br />Cutting the Co2 hose.  4-5 feet is minimum.<br /><br />WHAT does Co2 do?<br />2 things.<br />It keeps beer fresh. Ab out 1.5 months.<br />It also regulates how fast it pours.  adjust to low and it may not flow, adjust to high and you will get foam.<br />Do not adjust co2 too much after keg is attached.  The regulator does not work like a faucet.  It needs to be closed, drained of pressure before it can be adjusted.  So shut off tank, swing the flip valve horizontal (closed), and close screw valve (counter clockwise) until pressure reads 0. Now swing the flip valve to release pressure (open it)in hose leading to keg. Now swing flip valve closed again, open tank, adjust psi (clockwise) with screw valve, open swing valve, resume drinking beer.<br /><br />I have found that light beer is good at 8psi and regular beer is best at 6psi<br /><br />Cheers!!",

    "text": "I wanted to post a review on these filters to clear some things up.  One of the leading negative reviews points out that the openings are different shapes from the original.  This is true, but if the reviewer had taken a moment to look into their filter housing they would realize that this hole shape does not matter.  This is simply an opening for water to flow.  Water doesn't care if it is a square or round hole it is passing through.  If you look at the housing you will see that the filter seals to the housing where the two O-rings are.  The inner hole could be a triangle for all it matters.  The inner hole has no way of creating a leak.<br /><br />With that said.  The filter has worked well for the past month of so that I have had it installed.  A cheap alternative to OEM filters.  We've all seen how cheap brand name filters can be from refillable pitchers.  This is essentially the same thing but sealed, there is no reason a &#34;cheap&#34; filter should be too hard to believe.",

    "text": "Like other reviewers, I have very little counter space in my NYC kitchen. I too was waiting for the Tetra Heatworks dishwasher to finally hit the market. Since that doesn't seem like it's happening any time soon, I decided to try this dishwasher because it has the built-in water heater and tank.<br />Pros:<br />Performance-Works well. I've had success on the Rapid cycle. Everything comes out shiny and spotless.<br /><br />Filling the water--I bought a funnel so it's easier to pour the water in. I have to move it forward to fill it because of where I have it placed, but it's a minor issue.<br /><br />Drain hose--easy to connect and convenient suction cup to keep it in place.<br /><br />Noise level--really quiet. Even on Regular cycle, the drying segment of the cycle is very quiet.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The main con is that it is NOT a true Farberware product. It's from Edge Consumer Brands, as another reviewer stated. I'm concerned that if something goes wrong with it, I'll be out of luck. But I'm willing to take the gamble for now.<br /><br />If you hate hand washing dishes, you'll be pleased with this unit. It's small but mighty.<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER A FEW WEEKS<br />-I am loving this thing. It did seem as if it was not draining properly and leaking but you need to drain the drain hose downward after finishing a cycle, as a helpful Amazon commenter mentioned. Since I have been doing that, voila! No water in the back.<br /><br />-I have not had to use the Normal cycle. Rapid is faster, cleans perfectly. I just pull the rack forward and let the dishes air dry. Genius!<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER THREE MONTHS: I STILL LOVE IT<br />Cleans well but I've had three times recently where the drain hose comes unstuck from the sink and water drains all over my kitchen floor. I always check to see if the drain hose is properly secure. I'd knock one star off for this.<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER SEVEN MONTHS: WORKS LIKE A CHAMP<br />-Made wfh with all the extra dishes in NYC bearable. I purchased a Power Lock Suction Cup Hook to hold the drain hose in place in the dish pan I drain it in as the included rubber loop is crap and ripped. As long as you make sure you don't overfill, the drain hose clamp is on tightly, and hold the hose up then down after a wash to make sure all the water is drained out of it, (I'm draining lower then the height of table I have the DW on), you should be good.<br /><br />I do the glass setting if I want a longer cycle and clean (and heat dry), using pods. I use the rapid cycle if I have a smaller load and want to air dry.  LOVE this thing!",

However, it fails to wash the clothes well and is extremely time consuming to do even a small load of laundry. The washer has rough edges along one side that would simply just damage the clothes while washing. You would have to drain and refill the water multiple times in order to rinse the clothes well. As another reviewer had accurately stated, it is literally just a step above hand washing. Be cautious of water dripping along the tube as well. As for the dryer, it is poorly designed. It uses a spinning effect vs. heat. On the contrary, it is more rough in drying clothes than a standard dryer. It also lacks a way to filter all of the lint. The new towels and clothes laundered came out looking like they were old and worn/torn and had to be disposed of.

I did a small remodel of my laundry area this month, and decided if I was stuck having the ugly drain hose sticking out of my utility sink, I could at least have it be white like the sink so it wouldn't be such an eyesore. Well, the diameter of this hose is slighly smaller than the one that was previously on the washer - thus slowing down the water flow as it drains. Because of this, we were able to route the hose into the drain pipe (that hadn't been used in 20+ years)!! The speed of the draining water has been slowed enough that the pipe can now handle it. I'm so excited. My laudry area looks great, and is functioning the way it's supposed to. Thank you!",

    "text": "I bought this washer 2 years ago, to help alleviate our growing laundry once we had a baby.  We live in a 3rd floor apartment with one coin-operated machine in the basement, and we now have 2 kids.  We use this in combination with the Spin Dryer Portable Clothes Dryer, and it is so useful for all handwash items & any lightly soiled regular wash.<br /><br />It takes about 3 loads in the Wonderwash to equal one standard load, and when using with the Spin cycle it takes me about an hour from set up to clean up.  It doesn't clean things very well that have sat in the laundry basket for a long time, nor is it great for stains, unless you pretreat them and wash soon after.  The clothes definitely come out clean and as long as you don't overdo it on the soap, it really is a quick wash (as little as 1.5min for light loads!) and the rinse is only 30sec. . .it's great.  About the soap, I overdid it once & I wasted so much water having to rinse it all out that it's almost embarrassing to tell. .  .<br /><br />After 2 years it's still in perfect working order.  No parts show anything more than minimal wear.  The only thing is the little white ovals that were meant to cover the holes in the frame where it connects together fell out early on, but they were only for cosmetic reasons anyways, & well, I don't see that aesthetics matter much for this little guy.<br /><br />PROS<br />washes & rinses FAST!  1.5m-5m wash, 30sec - 1m rinse<br />perfect for delicates, great for lightly soiled clothes<br />Use less soap & water than a full size washer<br />Stands up to wear & tear<br /><br />CONS<br />a little tipsy if you add clothes before the water, but you are supposed to add water & soap first so I guess that's just MY problem. (I wish all the time i could just toss the clothes in as they get dirty, then once full just add the water & soap)<br />The suction cups on the bottom are a little annoying if you need to move it often, since you still have to hold it steady with your other hand while you spin.  I'd prefer just a grippy texture on the base, but I guess that's just personal preference.<br /><br />Summary - well made, nice little product for a more economical, environmentally friendly washer.  It handles almost anything, and works as well as the amount of effort you are willing to put forth.  I am still very happy with my purchase 2 years later.",

    "text": "I live in a 3rd floor apartment with one coin-operated washer & dryer all the way in the basement with a family of 4.  I try to be economical about clothing usage, but it still is difficult to stay ahead.  i use this along with the Wonderwash hand washer in my bathroom, primarily for lightly soiled clothes & delicate hand-wash items.  I've owned both machines for 2 years now, and have not encountered any problems with it at all.<br /><br />While the initial set up process can seem daunting, it really only takes a few minutes to do (once you figure out what set up works for you, it was a bit of a trial & error for me, as I was setting up both a hand washer & this spin cycle in a small bathroom with one outlet & some buckets to fill & drain the water)  It comes to about 3 loads with this set up for every one load in a standard size washer, and it takes me about an hour total, start to finish.  One small load can be done in 15!<br /><br />PROS<br />Clothes come out AMAZINGLY dry, it only takes a few hours hanging indoors, as little as 1hr outdoors on a nice day.<br />Simple control dial, just turn to desired time<br />Easy set-up instructions<br /><br />CONS<br />It shimmies a lot on start up & shut down, I have to hold it while it starts up, and then again at the end of the spin cycle, or it will fall off the counter.  I don't have the counter space to let it just go, but even if I did, I think it would topple somewhat easily, even when the clothes are loaded with the weight evenly distributed.<br />It can be tricky to get clothes loaded without being lopsided.  You'll know as soon as you start it if the load of clothes is off, and it works better when it is fuller.  After the first few uses you'll get the hang of it, but it would be nice if you didn't have to be SO exact about putting them in perfectly.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very helpful item to have on hand if you wash a lot of delicates by hand, or if you do not have easy access to a full size washer.  While very few actually LIKE to do laundry, this makes the task a little more manageable for me!",

It just runs and runs (it makes an audible hum, but it's not altogether unpleasant, to be honest) but does not produce any ice.<br />Unfortunately, I bought it in advance of my husband‘s birthday, so by the time he opened it and we figured out it doesn't work, the return window was closed and I'm essentially up a creek.

I followed the instructions which were very easy to understand and voila I had ice in no time at all. I got a cute little scooper from Amazon so no hands would go into the basket when retrieving cubes for their drinks.

They came in grey so they blended well with the stainless.  I got the long size as my handles are large.  They go on easily with velcro.  And no more smudged handles........my neighbors flipped over them when they saw them.  Especially the ones with kids.  They come right off easily to go into the washer.  Because they have velcro I put them in a laundry bag to keep them from sticking to other items in the washer.  About the only issue I have is that they 'spin' around on the handle.  If you're fussy like me, you want them to stay in one spot.  I bought a second set to go on the garage fridge/freezer and hubby also wanted one for his grill handle.  He likes it on the handle as it sometimes gets hot and this protects hi hand.  I recommend.  Especially for a household busy with children.",
