Our cloths has never been so fresh and clean!<br /><br />I can be more involved in the washing process and feel my clothes are much more clean compared to a standard washer. I have the option to cycle our dirties close through another wash cycle when needed. Love! Love! Love!<br /><br />Instructions were limited. I found a very useful YouTube video and suggest the following: Regular wash I set for “12”. Only loading the clothes where I am still able to easily move them around, fully submerged in water. Once finished drain and refill for rinse set at “6”. Transfer over to dryer and spill for the full “5” max setting.<br /><br />Hope this help!",

I wanted to use one on my bathroom linen closet because my nail polish is there and my 2 yr old grandson was getting close to being able to open the door. The only reason he can't open it yet is because my husband had replaced it with a new one. Well the new one has a larger diameter at the stem of the knob and these covers will not fit.

I've also used it for numerous other loose green teas, matcha (which is very finely ground), rooibos etc. The Finum brewing basket has dutifully performed and is by far the best I've owned. The mesh has sligthly darkened with time but otherwise remains strong and  intact. The plastic ribs appear slightly worn along the edges but it is more of a cosmetic than a functional issue.

He came and went several times trying to find the correct adapter part at Home Depot (2 stores), as well as 2 other stores near him. He tried several parts/adapters and none of them worked.  We of course were charged a bill for his time, which he absolutely deserves, and sadly called UPS to pick up the large crate we so carefully packed.

This hose has about a 4 inch bend radius before it would start to kink, so not bad there also as I had to snake it through the cabinets to the sink.<br /><br />The cheaper &#34;universal&#34; versions I found in the B&M stores did not have the same end fittings and would have needed some additional fittings to make them work. Worth getting the right one.",

    "text": "It seems every refrigerator manual still recommends using copper tubing to hook up a water source. Don't go there. Bought this as part of an installation for the icemaker on a refrigerator for the section between the water tap and the filter. Each end has a fitting designed for a 1/4-inch compression joint and worked perfectly. You'll need a 1/2-inch wrench to tighten. The braided covering over the 1/4-inch tubing appears to be polyester or something similar; it doesn't restrict the movement of the tubing and is designed to protect it from abrasions and cuts. If this item was out where I could see it I would have opted for something with a white braid, but this was the right price for this job. I dressed it up where necessary for neatness and strain relief with 3/8-inch clips, which fit snugly.",

Yes, the creama is a little less than the Nespresso pod produces, but not by much. And yes, it looks a bit scary at first, but it really isn't. Just take your time and it is easy. While the 1st one I did took about 2 minutes to finish by the 10th one, I was going from start to finish in under 1 minute - talk about a cost savings!<br /><br />While making 15 cups doesn't make me an expert, refilling 15 pods and making 15 perfect cups does add a bit of credibility to my review. A couple of things - get a softer, smaller brush to clean the rim of grounds as the one included in the kit is a bit too big and stiff; pack the very finely grounds down using the back of the included scoop but not too hard and leave about 1 mm of gap between the rim and the coffee. Use a needle nose pliers to remove the last bit of foil from around the rim before you put the new lid on. It is a great system and I am looking forward to enjoying many, many cups of really good coffee!.",

Simple reason, it is oversized with the wings or top edges that hang over the top of the pod.  Makes all the difference!!!<br /><br />When I started wanting to make my own pods for my Keurig rather than buying the prepackaged ones (more expensive) I quickly found out why the prepackaged pods are so popular. Very easy cleanup, but I still prefer the taste of freshly ground beans and packing the pod with various types of coffee and a little more than what comes in the standard pod.<br /><br />However the coffee tended to always have grinds and a lot of residue at the bottom of the cup. Simple, buy a filter. I quickly discovered that all filters are not equal.<br /><br />I've found that the key things for me are the flaps that hang over the top edge and the thickness of the filter. This filter gets A+ on both of these. The oversized flaps allow me to really fill the pod to the top and still not get grinds in my cup. They also make it super easy to clean up afterwards by grabbing the edge to pull out the soggy filter.  The thickness is just right as well and allows for great flavor without any tears (especially nice when you are cleaning up.<br />These fit my Keurig unit perfectly.  The filters remove the excess residue that was always in the bottom of my coffee cup and make cleanup virtually nothing. The only thing I do now is rinse the lid.  Needless to say I love these filters!!!!!<br /><br />If you have a Keurig and use the pod unit for your own coffee (rather than prepackaged Kpods, then you should buy these now. You will not regret it.<br /><br />Attached pics show what I received and how I use it.",

My favorite ones were out of stock and these were a better price but they are just okay.<br /><br />They do the job of the filter but the main issue is the top edge of the filter. On this particular one there isn't much there. I typically use the edge to pull the filter out and throw it away but with it having such a small edge that is hard to do and means either shaking it (grinds tend to get places you don't want) or grabbing onto hot grinds to get enough grip to pull it out for disposal.<br /><br />I also find that I still get some grinds in my coffee as I like a strong flavor and tend to fill the PID to the top so the edge doesn't always keep everything in.",

Not ideal ...<br /><br />My drink of choice pre covid was an ice cold Diet Coke from McDonalds. I absolutely had to have it every day. Then 2020 rolled around and I transformed into a home bound hermit and went cold turkey for 6 months. During which time I replaced my MCD habit with a stainless steel cup filled with copious opal ice and bottled Diet Coke. It's phenomenal. The ice makes all the difference.

The plastic water tubing in the back of the fridge leaked at first so I shut off the water supply but a repairman was sent out and it was fixed within a couple of weeks of receiving the refrigerator.  The single icemaker works well and makes plenty of ice for the three of us in the house.  It is noisy but the kitchen in not centrally located in the house as in newer open concept homes so the noise is of no consequence.  The stainless steel handles show finger prints but the rest of the fridge does not smudge easily.  Stainless steel appliance cleaner and a little effort makes it shine like new.  So far I am very glad that we bought this refrigerator.  We love the bottom drawer freezer.  Things used to fall out of our other refrigerator which had the freezer on top when the freezer door was opened.  It is nice not to have to worry about flattened toes any more.  :)",

And my caffeine habit would contribute greatly when I used individual pods.<br /><br />Now I use these Perfect EZ cups and the filters. No more plastic. And I sacrifice nothing insofar as taste.  I use the brand Mayorga purchased whole bean at Costco. Using their grinder, I ground the coffee using the fine setting and when I get home, it goes into a large decanter/jar. This is bold coffee but definitely not bitter.<br /><br />My coffee station in my home is as pictured above. It's efficient.  Not wasteful and so easy using Perfect Ez cups, filters.<br />Do the earth 🌍 a favor, convert to Perfect Ez Pod.<br />I highly recommend.",

We have NEVER previously owned a refrigerator where it wasn't instantly crammed to the hilt.  We actually have extra room in this refrigerator.  With the holidays not that far off, we're very excited about having a refrigerator than can finally accommodate a significant portion of our large family dinners.  The LED lighting makes everything quite visible now rather than hidden in the dark recesses of narrow shelves.  The adjustable shelving has already proven itself to us.  The refrigerator is quiet and the water produced through the filter and dispenser are quite good with no odd tastes to contend with.<br /><br />I can't address the long term quality of this refrigerator, but it appears well made, and we have come to really appreciate and rely on the lasting quality of the LG brand in a number of areas--other appliances, air conditioners, cell phones, etc.",

    "text": "We actually intended to purchase the KUDE50FXSS because it is cheaper but our 9.5 yr old Fisher Paykel died at Thanksgiving and, by Monday, I was anxious to get a replacement installed. The appliance store was out of the KUDE50FXSS because it is such a popular model, but they had a floor model of the KUDE70FXSS on sale for less than the one we wanted, so I took it. I didn't really want the very top (third) rack that one reviewer raved about and after about three uses, we removed it. The top (second rack) has two positions. In the 'down' position, it interferred with some of our dishes in the bottom rack, and in the 'up' position it interferred with the very top rack. Fortunately the very top rack is very easy to remove.<br /><br />This DW has more features than we need and I don't like heated dry because it is so hot. Frankly, the final rinse water is hot enough that dishes dry on their own in the dishwasher.I have tried washing glassware along with a couple of greasy microwave bacon cookers and have tried washing some really dirty pots (in pot scrubber mode) along with glassware, and everything came out very clean both times. The filter needs to be rinsed infrequently and all the rack adjustment options make it really easy to load. Some customers may like all of the wash options and those who don't can just ignore them. For the majority of people, I suspect that the KUDE50FXSS would be just fine.<br /><br />There are some plastic parts that are too delicate. We had to order replacements for several of them because numbskulls had broken them while playing with the unit at the appliance store. Also, the utensil rack has several plastic inserts with slots designed to keep your flatware separated so it won't \"spoon\". Our flatware doesn't fit in the slots so we removed them also. We have washed with cascade powder and Finish Powerballs. Both seem to work well and we mostly use the powerballs now. We also use JetDry in the dispenser.<br />.<br />This unit is so quiet, you actually have to listen very carefully to detect that it is on. The loudest sound is heard through the disposal when it empties. We highly recommend this unit, or the next one or two down, which most customers will likely find just as acceptable at a lower price.",

They're so easy to use that even my adult son has success with them. He has no patience, and most times, putting a prepackaged pod in the keurig is too much work for him. But I digress.<br />With these k cups, you don't have to worry about leaving three particles of ground coffee on the rim, making them pop open. No worries about your machine rejecting the cup, telling you it's not compatible. They work flawlessly every time. They're easy to clean, and I do recommend that you clean them after every couple of uses.<br />You'll get more oils and fine particles of grounds in your cup. I kinda like that.<br />As for the water filters...well, they're filters. I inserted one. It works.<br />This is a quality combo with an economic price. What more could you ask?",

I've only owned it for a short while, but here's the skinny:<br /><br />FREEZER:<br /><br />The top freezer hits the ideal 0 degrees F in just a few hours by setting the thermostat on the center position. I deliberately bought a unit with no ice maker on the theory that ice makers are notorious troublemakers. DOWNSIDE: there's NO FREEZER LIGHT. I stuck a little Motion Sensor LED Night Light to the freezer roof to fix the issue.<br /><br />REFRIGERATOR:<br /><br />The refrigerator achieved 37-40 degrees F in a few hours with the thermostat only on the second position. My fridge is a simple unit with LED light, two crisper drawers, a smallish dairy bin and two shelves. Some units include an optional door alarm and pantry drawer, but not mine.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />This LG top-freezer refrigerator is VERY quiet and energy efficient. The dimensions are excellent for my small kitchen and contains enough food for over a week for my wife and I. This refrigerator is just a tiny bit shorter and narrower than some, which can be a major plus when situating it in some kitchens, especially in older houses. But the refrigerator is an inch or two deeper than some, so measure carefully.<br /><br />I didn't realize it at first, but the doors are reversible. The fridge comes set up with the doors opening to the right, but even an inexperienced person (like myself) can switch the hardware so the doors open to the left in an hour by following the on-line videos.<br /><br />LG refrigerators have a some of the best reputations for reliability, so I'm expecting this LG LTCS20020 to outlast me.

I didn't want an inductance stove and Consumer Reports gave the GE JP5030SJSS 30\" radiant stove high marks. I bought the stove and, of course, Amazon reduced the price $110 the next day! (Double grump.)<br /><br />The stove is gorgeous and I'm glad to get rid of those pesky knobs that make cleaning the sleek stove surface awkward. The touch-sensitive surface controls four burners with a quiet musical tone when activated or changing temperature. Burners heat up FAST--about ten seconds for full blast. Lights indicate hot burners even during the cool down phase. Activating the safety lock prevents accidental touches from turning on burners.<br /><br />DOWNSIDES:<br /><br />The true exterior dimensions of this stove are 20-7/8 X 29-3/4. This proved a minor issue since my Jenn-Air used a slightly larger cutout.<br /><br />For crying out loud, GE, include a set of wire nuts and maybe a conduit connector! They cost almost nothing. I reused my old wire nuts, but come on.<br /><br />BIGGEST PROBLEM: The GE JP5030SJSS places a big honkin' box at the bottom rear of the stove, plus the overall thickness measures considerably more than my Jenn-Air or a standard coil burner stove. You are either going to have to retrofit your stove drawers or remove face plates, attach them to the cabinet and kiss off your drawers. I cut off about four inches from my drawer backs and shaved off half an inch from the top edges, but many people don't have the tools or experience for this retrofit. Be warned!<br /><br />Four stars.",

You can just shove it down the duct by hand or use an electric drill to spin clean the duct with a clockwise spin. (NOTE: you MUST use clockwise--counterclockwise will unscrew the sections!) The long, soft fiberglass sections sorta flop sideways all over the place when using a drill, so you might need to slowly feed it in a section at a time. When I finished, I also used a blower to blast out the last of the lingering dust.<br /><br />NOTE: Don't tear up the package it ships in--just pull out the staples. When finished you can easily repack and store the tough package on the wall.<br /><br />NOTE 2: You might be able to use this kit to clean refrigerator coils.

The Samsung DV56H9100GG was well-regarded, but CR listed it as #1 which sealed the deal for me. I bought mine at Home Depot and they delivered it within the week.<br /><br />I've been using my new dryer for several months and it is quite a step up over the old Kenmore. It is very quiet and energy efficient. Plus there are a variety of spiffy drying options that weren't there in the old days: a &#34;Wrinkle Prevent&#34; to keep clothes looking good if you can't get back to the dryer in time; &#34;Wrinkle Away&#34; for clean stuff that just needs a spritzing and tumble dry; a variety of settings for anything from light blouses to heavy towels and bedding, and an illuminated drum so you can see what you are doing. They even include a drying rack for tennis shoes, toys, etc., though I usually just stick stuff like that out on the back porch to dry.<br /><br />The Samsung dryer is several inches taller than my old Kenmore, which makes me glad I didn't buy the pedestal that raises it off the floor; I don't think it would have fit in my available space and I certainly couldn't fold stuff on the top surface. In any case, check the dimensions of your laundry area before buying.<br /><br />This Samsung dryer looks O.K. (shrug, it IS basically a big box) and appears well made. It sounds cute soft musical tones and tunes to signal different features. The &#34;load finished&#34; tune is rather long and resembles (to me) an 8-bit version of a &#34;Pirates of the Caribbean&#34; drinking song. ;) The lint trap is tucked on the door edge for easy access. Unfortunately, my new dryer door opens to the right and it appears to be a tremendous hassle--possibly impossible--to change the hinge direction.<br /><br />This is a pricey critter and if I ever have a problem I'll post an update immediately. I doubt I'll get 30 years like I did with my old Kenmore, but this is a really nice clothes dryer. Five stars.",

    "text": "We got our Samsung RF23J9011 from Home Depot in September 2018 for about $2700 give or take.  Man o' man, do I wish I had read the Amazon reviews first!  Who thinks about Amazon for large home appliances?<br /><br />Wee bough the RF23J9011 based on its list of features, which are impressive.  We were limited to a counter-depth style and wanted French Doors.  We didn't want to pay for Wi-Fi, or some fancy video see-though.  The RF23J9011 had exactly the features that we wanted and none that we didn't.<br /><br />Pre-Covid, delivery was a snap and we had our new Samsung within a week of ordering it.  We loved it for about a month.<br /><br />The first thing that disappointed us was the limited capacity of the icemaker.  With only 3 of us we noticed that sometimes we would run out of  ice.  Not terribly often, but disappointing for a new $2700 refrigerator that we would have for the next 10-15 years.  And then after about 3 months, not ice at all.  A quick inspection revealed that the ice maker had frozen up, as if there was a leak in it.  We chipped away the ice build up manually and the ice maker started working again.  We never did find a leak.  Then it happened again about 5 weeks later.  Exactly the same. A quick check on the internet revealed that almost all of the RF23J9011s had the same problem.  A design flaw.  Then we started to read about other problems.<br /><br />When it was 18 months old, the freezer compartment started going wonky.  I bought a thermometer to monitor the temperature.  Over the course of a couple of weeks it varied from about 10 degrees F to 30 degrees, all the while being set a t (and reading) -5F.  I tried unluggingi it to reset the computer.  No go. Then it stopped working altogether intermittently. We looked for a local repair service to fix it, and could only find one that worked on Samsungs.  They told us some very scary things about Samsung refrigerators, but came out and use an infrared temperature gun to determine that the cooling was OK, but the fan was probably bad.  It took a week to get a fan and $262 later the repairman left and said wait 24 hours and call in the morning.  The fan didn't fix the problem and the repair guy said he would have to replace the motherboard, but that parts from Samsung were notoriously hard to get.  By this time we had long ago transferred everything from the freezer compartments to the large chest freezer in the garage, so things weren't so bad.  But after waiting about 3 weeks, the refrigerator started to die.<br /><br />Now I'd had enough and called Samsung.  They gave us the number of the only authorized Samsung repair service called Service Quick.  It took me over 2 weeks to get an appointment.  When the guy finally shows up, the refrigerator had been completely dead for 10 days.  We used bags of ice to keep stuff inside cool.  What a mess.  It only takes him 15 minutes to tell me that this was a \"sealed system problem\", meaning everything was still under warranty, and that he's pick up a compressor and be back --- in about 2 weeks.  When there was no return call from Service Quick 3 weeks later, I wrote a very long and nasty letter to the Corporate Offices.  Two days later I got an email and a phone call from one of the Vice-Presidents, telling me how sorry he was, and promising to call Service Quick and get them out to the house ASAP.  A week later I called Service Quick to find out what was happening and they asked me if I wanted schedule a service call.  I nearly had a stroke.  After scheduling a service call (for about 15 days later), I emailed the Samsung VP back and also tried to call the direct number that he'd given me in the first email.  I left a message.<br /><br />Then I ordered a tiny refrigerator from Amazon I(RCA RFR320-B-Black-COM RFR321 Mini Refrigerator, 3.2 Cu Ft,<br />$144.99 that arrived in 2 days. I called the VP back he was very apologetic and promised me a full refund.  That was a week ago and I've heard nothing back since.<br /><br />The Service Quick guy is scheduled to come back in 5 days so we'll see.  If he can't fix it, I'l order something else. Why haven't I done that already?  Same reason that the Samsung VP didn't offer me a new refrigerator.  Almost everything seems to have a 3-6 week wait because of Covid.<br /><br />So Samsung refrigerators suck and it is virtually impossible to get them repaired.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY A SAMSUNG REFRIGERATOR<br /><br />JM Tepper<br /><br />ps.  a year and a half later.  Not too long after I wrote the original one star review, the refrigerator section completely quit.  I had had enough.  I called Samsung Corporate offices directly and got the email address of the President.  I emailed him the whole story up to that point, demanding a new refrigerator.  Within 24 hours I got a reply from some senior VP who promised to send a Samsung team out to me and guaranteed that if they couldn't fix all the problems with the refrigerator, that they would indeed replace it with a new unit.<br /><br />The Samsung crew arrived a few days later right on schedule and after about 30 minutes, diagnosed the problem as a \"sealed system\" problem meaning that the guts of the cooling system had a leak or blockage.  They were able to isolate the block, drained the whole system, cleared the blockage, checked the tubes for leaks and refilled it.  Problem solved.  They also replaced the entire Icemaker.  All under warrantee, didn't cost me a dime (except for all the food that went bad earlier).<br /><br />Now, about 1.5 years later, the refrigerator has been working like a charm every since Samsung was here.  The moral of the story is that if you have a problem with a Samsung refrigerator, don't call Sears, don't call a local repair shop, go directly to Samsung.<br /><br />On the basis of this, I changed the original 1 star rating to 3 stars.",

Using the refillable pods allows you to have a much larger selection of coffee types since you don't have to look for a brand/type in a pre made pod. I can get 30 to 35 refills from a 10.5 oz container of ground coffee that is only costing about 5 to 6 dollars.

Once we hooked it up (an easy procedure), I was surprised at all the convenient features:  a high-speed &#34;boost&#34; button, a sensor that responds to temperature, a sensor to tell you when the filters need changing and easy-to-operate controls.  We chose to use it unvented at this time but we can always vent it later if we decide to ramp up our cooking.  The only downside that I see is that it doesn't include the duct  work for the vent.  However, the duct work is bulky and has to be designed to fit the installation.  There is an adapter for both square and round ducts included in the box.",

It is made in USA, and the quality is very good.  Even at its highest speed, it is not overly loud.  Its noise rating at 200cfm is lower than any other fan I researched between 160 and 190cfm.<br /><br />The product description says you need to install the RF-34 charcoal filter to \"convert\" it to ductless operation.  I went ahead and paid the $10 (including shipping) for the filter.  It rests between the metal grease filter and the fan.  It has no other function than to remove odors, so you could probably do without it.<br /><br />Installation was straightforward.  It operates very well and looks very good.  It shipped quickly and was packaged adequately.  I would have paid close to $200 for something similar at my local home improvement store, and even then it would have been manufactured in China.  I definitely recommend this product, and recommend purchasing it from Amazon.",

And, it's all about the crema, right campers?<br />The positives: we could source organic coffee for refilling the pods<br />The negative: no crema to speak of, laborious emptying, cleaning/washing/drying of the pods, and then the refilling which is labor intensive to the point where I wonder why I'm not just using a burr grinder and espresso machine…<br />I really like the Vertuo; anyone can make a durn good cuppa with these things. The availability of third party pods is, however, nonexistent and that is troubling as Nestle has never been on the cutting edge of organic Fair-Trade in sourcing their coffee products.<br />In the meantime, after having used the Geesta system for six months and over 300 pods, I am reluctantly going back to the Nestle product.<br />Three stars is really generous of me but the product intent is good and maybe you will have better luck achieving an effective and consistent pod seal.",

The only drawback is that you cannot reach the back row of the bottom shelf without clearing off the top 2 shelves first. I have smaller hands and I cannot put eggs in or take them out of the back row of the bottom shelf without raising, at least the middle shelf first. After emptying the middle shelf and raising it, I can just barely reach in and remove eggs from the bottom shelf. So keeping the oldest eggs on top will be a challenge.

With this one there re no nooks or crannies for anything to get into, so cleaning is super quick and simple.<br /><br />The two fans provide more than enough airflow for my stove. If anything, I would say that the two fans are overkill and make a bit more noise than I would like. The overhead light is more than bright enough. Unfortunately, it does give off a pretty harsh, full spectrum light that you wouldn't want to have to use for long periods, but is good enough for cooking.<br /><br />Construction is of pretty solid sheet metal and there are no imperfections of any kind.

It is really overkill for someplace like a bedroom though. Assuming that you have such a large area, the product works fairly well. The large amount of water it holds means that you will not need to refill it for several hours at a time, which can be a problem with the smaller devices.<br /><br />Due to potential mold build-up you will need to rinse this unit out occasionally, which is a bit of a chore. Just picking it up and lugging it around is quite a chore. There are no handles or other easy way to grasp the device. I would recommend only using distilled water in this device in order to minimize how often you will need to clean it.<br /><br />I certainly can't complain that the product does not work as intended.

It is light and easy to move around for when you aren't using it, but it also does not support very large pots/pans. So, if you think that you are going to be able to put a tea kettle on one burner and a full-sized skillet on the other burner you can forget about it. The heating elements are way too close together for large pots or pans, so you can only use one that is full-sized at a time.<br /><br />The heating elements themselves are fairly small, so if you are trying to heat a large skillet it will only get to full temperature towards the center. For those of you who don't know the difference between a full-sized electric stove and one of these portable units you should keep in mind that most electric ovens with burners are directly connected to a dedicated 220V circuit, which gives them FAR more energy than a standard 110V power outlet. The result is that neither of the burners gets anywhere near as hot as the heating coils on an electric oven. Water takes longer to boil. Food takes longer to cook. So, be sure to allow for more cooking time than you normally would with an electric oven.<br /><br />Despite its limitations, for its current price of around $23 this portable electric stove is a bargain. It's something that can easily be dragged into the back yard for BBQs or for plugging in anywhere outdoors. It is not perfect for every situation, but for some situations it works perfectly.",

It's much bigger than I anticipated, so it doesn't fit where I would like it to go. My bathroom is small too so it goes in my bedroom. I can fit about half a load of laundry in here. The barrel is big, but don't overfill it or it won't really get washed. I fill it with about 4 buckets of water per wash. I like that I can drain it bucket by bucket instead of it coming out all at once. After it's drained, I'll spin out the clothes. I'll normally have three loads of spins for everything I washed. The spin dryer is really powerful and it comes out almost dry (of course, not completely dry like you would with a heated dryer). Then my laundry goes out on my deck to dry.<br />I had a really hard time understanding the instruction manual since it was written in Chinese and translated to english, but if you have some common sense you don't really need it.<br /><br />Update: I've been using this for about a month and it's still working fine. My issue is that I didn't think rinsing out the clothes wouldn't be a big issue, but it is. I need to now go wash my clothes in a standard washing machine because my clothes are so full of soap, dirt, etc. However, after using only this for a month, I'm still impressed that I could get by without a washer for so long.",

    "title": "Good product with a couple of drawbacks",
    "text": "I went online to purchase paper filters for my Chemex, and then saw this product and decided to give it a whirl.  Below are pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Filter works very well.  I used on two successive mornings and coffee was delicious.<br />- Good quality.  Fits perfectly into the Chemex.  Also, I appreciated the rubber gasket that goes along the top of the cone; this creates a good seal so if you happen to pour too much water into the filter, the grounds won't seep into the Chemex.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Usability.  I didn't like the procedure.  Think of it this way:  You pour the very hot water through the filter; after all the water is poured you're ready to pour a cup of coffee, so you remove the filter.  It doesn't drip much because the filter holes are very fine, however there are still wet grounds in there.  So you turn it over to dump them out (I put them into a plastic receptacle and then do a weekly dump into the compost pile), but the metal part of the cone where you have to hold it is very hot (obviously because you just poured 210 degree water through there).  You manage this, but still about 20% of the grounds are sticking onto the filter, which requires you to manually wipe them out with a paper towel or something.  And the cone is still hot.  After wiping them out there's still about 5% of the grounds in there, mostly stuck in the very bottom of the cone.  So your last recourse is to rinse it into the sink.  This allows grounds to go into the drain; I wipe as much as I can out of the sink, but inevitably some slip into the drain, and coffee grounds and drains are not a good match.  As long as you're in the sink, you may as well wash the filter with soap, etc.  Meanwhile, back at the Chemex, some heat loss has occurred with the coffee.  This was my experience anyway.  Maybe there is a better &#34;workflow&#34; for this, but I just found it infinitely easier to remove and discard the paper filter with grounds.<br /><br />- Cleaning and longevity.  Some reviews I read mentioned that they had issues with the filter clogging.  Indeed, in the packaging there are actually instructions on how to clean, and what to do if it clogs.  Putting in dishwasher, soaking in vinegar, etc.  Nothing that's a big deal.  But the fact that they addressed this in the packaging gives credibility to the reviews that cite this as an issue.  And so the question then becomes, do you want to spend time maintaining a filter.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- Price is still probably a little steep, but it should pay for itself after a year (or less depending on how much you brew) of use.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I'm rating this 4 stars because I don't think there's anything wrong with the product.  It does what it says it will do, and it seems to do it well, which is to serve as a substitute for paper filters.  However I decided to return due to the &#34;usability&#34; issue described above.  My mornings are already a multitasking bonanza with making breakfast, packing lunches, feeding the dog, etc and I just don't need to add anything else to the morning workflow.  If this doesn't describe you though then it might be a good fit.",

    "text": "I'm quite happy with this blower, which I fitted to my non-Broan hood.  The motor and impeller parts are made by ebmpapst in Germany,  the largest manufacturer of fan motors worldwide (so they claim, but their product line is absolutely huge) very high quality and well made.  5 stars.  I assume Broan designed and makes the aluminum sheet metal enclosure, it's also well executed,  all the screw holes lineup just so,  of a heavy gauge.  Well boxed for shipping btw.<br /><br />I was surprised to see how non-waterproof this is however.  Water running down a roof and hitting the top edge will just flow right into the enclosure.  But this is by design,  water can just flow right across the base plate inside the enclosure and out the bottom. The 10&#34; opening for the air duct has a large upward lip on it,  so water can't get in there.  But Broan was careless with the 1/2 hole for the electrical connection,  water can get in here.  I bought a water-tight romex clamp which has a gasket for panel mounting,  that took care of that,  and I also used a high quality sealant across the top and down both sides.  I left the bottom open so water can escape, if any were to get in their now.<br /><br />I had a roofer install the unit. He did not like the very short mounting edges, hardely 2 inches of the baseplate on all sides.  I had to find a metal shop that added a wide baseplate and used lots of sealant and rivets to attach.  This Broan unit is aluminum,  which takes special equipment to weld,  so rivets is probably the only choice.<br /><br />I installed a Broan 72W variable speed control in my kitchen,  which works as advertised,  though there is an audible 60 cycle hum from the motor that I'll bet originates with this controller.  When running the fan in a medium to low speed range this hum is irritating imho, after all these large blowers and controls are Broan's premier products in kitchen ventilation. But that's more an attribute of the control.  This blower would be 5 stars except for all the additional work needed when installing. I'm expecting many years of trouble free use.",

It's so difficult to replace that we've just left it without the flip door and have resorted to trying to throw the detergent pod in after the rinse cycle is done (if we can catch it as it's draining).  This is a pretty serious and frustrating design flaw.  I really wish Whirlpool would fix it.

YES!  From the Google Play Store (I do not know if this works well from the iPhone App Store), it asked for an email address and password to set up an account, but then instead of asking for a credit card number, it simply had me verify my email with a 6 digit code they sent to it.  NO CREDIT CARD NUMBER required when the app is downloaded from the Google Play Store.<br /><br />Be sure to take note that this is a 2.4ghz device, so your wifi router must not be set to 5ghz.  My Smart Life app originally tried to set up on the 5ghz wifi, as I think that app supports both...but this thermometer needed the 2.4ghz channel instead.  Once I changed it, it worked fine.<br /><br />So I am happy with the result, as I have it in a detached garage and have its alarm set to tell me if the temperature drops below 45 degrees.

For me it was problematic because the outlet for my washer and dryer was on only a 20 amp circuit. A 30-amp dryer plug would have been more convenient for me. That said, it is nice to know that I can use this dryer if my next apartment doesn't have a dryer outlet.<br />2. Decent little workhorse--takes some time to get things dry, but it does what it's designed to do.<br />3. Lightweight--I don't feel like I'll be over-burdening my friends if I ever ask them to help me move.<br />Cons:<br />1. It's far too short -- plan on either mounting it to the wall, building a pedestal, or developing back problems. If I were to recommend a redesign for the next model it would be to put the controls near the top.<br />2. The vent on the back is a non-standard size (about 3 3/8 inches). This made putting a dryer tube on the back a pain. I followed the advice of another reviewer and removed some of the wire from a 4&#34; wide flexible aluminum duct and was able to clamp it on with some careful finagling.<br />3. Drum wouldn't spin on first running the machine. I had to open it up and wrap the belt around the drum to get it to spin (I don't really knock stars off for this, since it happens from time to time; but I mention it for anyone who does buy it--if it doesn't spin at first, unplug it, take of the back panel and have a look before returning it -- saved me a shipping headache).<br /><br />Overall:<br />If your choice is no dryer or this dryer, buy this dryer. I really like having a dryer, but I don't particularly like having this dryer. Between it's height and the difficulty attaching the hose to the vent, I don't think I'd buy it again. That said, it is a decent bargain, and it does the job I need it to do. I can't hate it too much.",

I knew I needed to wash smaller loads to have it dry well, but I loved the fact I didnt have to rewash clothes anymore from forgetting to dry them since it goes straight on to dry! But since the day the factory warranty expired it has been nothing but repairs and no support or even troubleshooting help from Sears. When Husband and I finally figured out the first error code, we realised that the unit was missing about half the necessary screws insides for attaching the exhaust. Its in a small closet so we looked- no screws fallen out anywhere nearby.... we replaced the heater element and it worked fine for a little while... but I should not have let Sears off so easily about the missing screws... in the 8 months since then I have had to replace both pumps, two heat sensors, the dryer fan, and the faceplate is showing cracks from underneath where it connects to the main washer body that have likely been slowly propagating since day 1. I am 100% sure this unit was not put together correctly at the factory and basically had been shaking itself to peices that first year unbenknownst to me and now that the warranty expired before I found any of the problems I am left with a two grand priced lemon of a washer dryer and doubtful it will last another year even with replacing almost every part imaginable.... Next time, I will get one straight from LG or ANYONE else as long as they have an all in one washer and ventless dryer thats about 4.5 cu ft, or I am going to just get a decent front loader and go back to old school hang drying... but never another Kenmore appliance after this fiasco.",

That also means they don't release these particles into the tea water itself, and as a result you don't have to use a strainer.<br /><br />The mesh on these is like the goldtone filter used for coffee makers since the 1980s or so.  They keep particles out of the water.<br /><br />What I'd like to see to make these better is hinged \"wings\" that flip up so the filters can be used over wider tea pots.<br /><br />As it is, I need to buy both sizes depending on the opening of my various tea  pots.  If they had \"wings\" that flipped up until they were horizontal I wouldn't have to do that.<br /><br />At any rate, they work great and it's great to not have to use a strainer when pouring tea.<br /><br />These are currently the only tea strainers Grace Teas and Mark T. Wendell (where Julia Child bought her tea) offer for sale, and I'm sured they've tried just about every design out there before settling on these.<br /><br />These are also much easier to clean up after using because the mesh is so fine particles don't get stuck in the mesh the way they do with tea balls.<br /><br />The product could be improved with wings so it can be used in even wider opening tea pots,, and there's no need to use the lid when using in a tea pot (use the pot's lid instead), but other than that, there's nothing that performs better at keeping dust and fine particles off your counters and out of your water.

    "text": "Whoever designed the dish rack that rolls in and out of the unit doesn't have a clue about what its function is.  Average sized dishes are too tall to stand straight up so need to be positioned at an angle, and there's no easy way to do that.<br /><br />Tip:<br /><br />As soon as you run into the problem bend every single metal prong forward about 10 degrees on each side and you can suddenly fit all your normal-sized dishes in the dishwasher at a slight angle forever after and they'll still clean just as well.  They should have designed it this way.<br /><br />Worse, the bottom of the rack has a \"hole\" toward the back that (I guess) is where the utensils basket is supposed to go because nothing else can without falling through to the bottom.  This is beyond stupid, as you may need to move the basket forward to fit something.  This situation is made worse in that the holes in the bottom of the basket are too small to allow any of the upward projections from the dish rack fit through the bottom so you can place it pretty much anywhere else you want, AND if you put the basket over that hole it will tilt at times and obstruct the washer arm.<br /><br />Rocket scientists, whoever designed the dish holder rack and basket, are not.<br /><br />So while loading it can be a needless hassle, as the bars in the basket are just too far apart in many places and this also affects where you can stack things like bowls or cups or small saucers, otherwise it works pretty well, and I find for economy the P3 setting (which the manual says is about 70 minutes -- the shortest one possible) washes well without running on and on for a very long time, and the dishes come out clean anyway, so why would you want to run it longer?<br /><br />I'm still a little confused as to why the cycle stops for long periods of time and the display flashes (indicating the wash cycle isn't yet complete) and it seems to be doing nothing, and yet it's not done because it's not yet drained the water (and the display stops flashing).  Maybe it's heating the dishes to sterilize them or something?  I don't know, but at any rate just leave it alone and wait until the display stops flashing and the unit beeps multiple times in succession.  That's when it's done, and that's when you'll want to turn off the faucet, press the red button at the faucet attachment to release the water pressure, and then turn off the dishwasher's power button, open the door, and pull the basket forward to let the dishes air dry (or \"spot dry\" them with a towel (there's so much heat inside the dishwasher at this point they'll be mostly dry anyway).<br /><br />Keep in mind placement can be a problem since it's a big unit and needs to be within about 6\" of your countertop height for the water to drain correctly.  Some people may need to get a cart at this height and roll it near the sink.  We got a restaurant supply stainless cart from online (but honestly, if you're going to go to that expense you may as well just move up to a $500+ GE or similar dishwasher that would be taller, that you could fit twice the dishes in (without the hassles), its own cart (rolls), and it would give you some work surface on top).<br /><br />Other than these quibbles, and the owner's manual being so poorly written and in a tiny almost illegible typeface and print quality, it's been a good buy, especially since I was able to find an open box unit online for $175 that I called about and ultimately got for $150 including free shipping.<br /><br />At that price I wasn't expecting much, but it's been a pleasant surprise, with just the reservations I mentioned, which could easily be fixed the next time the company updates the product in any way.<br /><br />_________________________________<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Nine months later and it still works as good as new, but if I had it to do over again I would buy a full-sized dishwasher on wheels since this one sometimes has to be run twice to do the stuff used to make a dinner with a main course and one or two side dishes, and each time I run it it's 70 minutes where I'm stuck waiting for it since I don't want to leave the house with the pressure still on on the water at the faucet (which it will be until you close the taps and press the red button to release it).  Our apartment faucet has had to be replaced because of this pressure since the rubber seal finally gave out under the stress and it started to leak, but I think it was a shoddy faucet/installation anyway and this may not be common.<br /><br />UPDATE 2:<br /><br />It's now over two years later and this is still working, problem free, even though I've used it daily.  Whoever designed the basket, by now it seems absolutely RIDICULOUS, but I've learned by now what will go where without falling through the too big spaces.<br /><br />_________________________________<br /><br />PERFECT CART FOR THIS:<br /><br />It may help others to know that I found a really good stainless steel cart to pair with this.  You can find it online with a search auction or at that famous auction site starting with \"e.\"  It was very easy to assemble (and I'm not someone who says that often).  It's also stylish for a high tech look in your kitchen or to pair with the finish on the dishwasher.  You will need a special screwdriver to put the rods that go from the top through each leg to the bottom, but you can just take one into a hardware store and pick it up cheap.<br /><br />Stainless Steel Utility Cart Large Size 350 Lbs Capacity<br />Manufacturer: AllStrong Restaurant Equipment California<br />Model Number:  C-32K<br /><br />NSF Certified<br />Stainless Steel Construction<br />3 Tiers 13-1/2\" Clearance<br />Overall Size: 18\"W x 29\"L x 34\"H<br />350 Lbs Load Capacity<br />5\" Swivel Casters",

I pulled the filter out of that & it was moldy from not being used.  So I have replaced both with generic brand which fit perfectly.  2 mos I will replace coffee one.  Hot water one we leave out once we are done with heating the water.  We also never leave water in the reservoir, but filter still went moldy. When the coffee brews the condensation goes under the lid of the hot water reservoir.  So we also keep that open.  Good price, many filters, perfect fit!!!",

After a couple washes it started to leave a soapy residue on all of our dishes. We cleaned it by running some empty loads with only vinegar and it clean it out perfectly. We've since switched to a liquid detergent and haven't had any further issues. The dish washer is small, but its pretty impressive how much you can fit in.

I decided to just let the machine continue making ice and see what happened. The ice holder inside held all of the cubes and got colder as more ice was added, and the cubes did not melt like the first cubes made. So, the key is to leave the machine alone and let it make its ice and it works great! Some people complained of noise, I did not mind the fan running nor the sound of the ice dumping. Not a big deal to me. Some questions listed were afraid of mildew in the machine. I just dried it out, left the top open to air dry and don't see an issue with moisture. The cube sizes are great and are made very quickly, just like the company said. Would highly recommend!",

    "text": "After doing some research, I picked this as my first wine fridge. I needed a fridge that would last me through at least 1 move and 4 more years of school, and most reviews I found on different sites from people who bought the same model fridge said they'd been running without a problem for years.<br />The fridge was well packaged, delivered by UPS with labels and packaging very clearly showing what was inside. No dents on the box. Easy to unpackage, and is very aesthetically appealing straight out of the box. The tint on the glass door is perfect- the interior is still visible-ish without the interior light on, so the fridge blends in perfectly with all my black shelving.<br />Because I went with a thermoelectric fridge over a compressor, I decided against putting it in my (poorly-ventilated) kitchen, but besides the tiny read out for temp and the buttons, it's a fairly non-descript (and small, much smaller than I imagined) addition to my living room. And its very quiet. The noise it makes is a low hum, so once I got used to the new hum in my living room, it very easy to tune out. My humidifier makes more noise than the fridge (another score for thermoelectric!).<br />My one gripe is that the racks inside aren't very accomodating for irregularly sized wine bottles. Of the 14 bottles I had to store, 4 couldn't fit in the standard shelving. I took one shelf out, but the rounded divets in the metal for bottles were too small for 1 bottle as well. I ended up putting 3 large bottles on the bottom shelf and stacking the 4th on top of that. It's only a gripe because it wasn't what I had planned, but I didn't deduct any stars because once the door is closed, the tinted glass doesn't show the stacked bottles. Just got it today, but will try to remember to update my review in 1 years time.<br /><br />Edit:<br />2yrs and 2 moves in and its still going strong. I have a dedicated thermometer/hygrometer in there to make sure the temp in the door is accurate, and it is. Very, very happy with my purchase.<br />Of course, getting a wine fridge may mean getting more wines that you think you'll drink soon but you end up cellaring. But in this hypothetical situation, you may not have a place to cellar wines. So you may start looking for a \"cellar fridge\" so that the Whynter fridge can be for wines you plan on drinking soon.",
