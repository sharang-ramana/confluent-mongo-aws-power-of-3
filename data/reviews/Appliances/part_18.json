    "text": "UPDATE 8.22.2019 : After many many many uses . . . minus a star because it doesn't catch all the coffee grounds so the coffee in pot is a little gritty.  Minus another star because every once in a while the coffee is not evenly brewed.  There are some dry spots in the grounds.  My husband prefers the paper filters because paper filters works perfectly every time.<br /><br />I bought this for my at-home coffee maker: the Hamilton Beach 2-Way Brewer, Model # 49980Z.  I really like this HB Gold Tone filter for my coffee maker.  It makes it super easy to remove the coffee grinds with its movable handle.  Note: make sure the handle is down before shutting the lid on the brewer.  I am excited that I no longer have to worry about the paper filter falling in on itself, this means that there are fewer grounds at the bottom of the coffee pot.  I have only made a partial pot and the grounds stay in the basket.  I don't know if the filter can handle the full 12 cup carafe with full strength coffee as we don't drink that much coffee here.  The top of the filter is about 11 cm in diameter, the bottom of the filter is about 8.3 cm in diameter, height of filter is about 6 cm, the bottom of filter goes about 0.8 cm inward in the middle.  This filter fits loosely in my coffee basket (there is a 2 to 3 mm gap if filter is pushed to one side), but it does not seem to jiggle while brewing.  The black part of the filter is plastic.  The copper tone part of the filter appears to be some sort of metal mesh.  For care, I lightly hand wash with Dawn, rinse, and then air dry in dish rack.  I am not a coffee connoisseur so I have no clue how it affects the flavor of my coffee; my coffee still tastes like coffee.  Overall, I am very happy with this filter.",

However, it doesn't fit much. I was able to fit just a couple of outfits at a time. When drying towels it holds a couple of them at a time with a few wash rags and hand towel.

    "text": "We bought this portable washing machine to go in our rv... but we ended up having to bring it inside recently when our fairly new larger washing machine inside our home started having electrical issues. It has worked so well that I have continued using it inside and have delayed getting my large washer fixed😅 I have been amazed at how good it washes the clothes and how efficient it is.. Very impressed!!<br />As far as load size goes, I am able to wash about 4 large towels with some rags & a couple of hand towels in one load. Not bad at all!🙂I'm curious as to if it'll continue to keep up with my laundry though.. will give an update in a few weeks but again so far I am amazed 😁👍<br /><br />UPDATE: (5/24/21)<br />It's been about 2 months of using this washer and I really like it!!<br />On a side note: be careful though that you do not accidently put too many clothes in one load.  Our daughter made that mistake and when it was filling the water it banked off the clothing and made a little puddle of water in the floor. We let her know how much laundry is a safe amount and that hasn't happened again since. So just might want to keep that in mind when you're putting your load in👍🙂<br /><br />UPDATE: (9/4/21)<br />well it's only been about 6 months of using this washer and I'm sad to report that it looks like the inside is starting to come apart and decay😒 that's what I'm guessing.. but not sure why pieces are coming off the top of the inside bucket. Not sure if when it's in the spin cycle that the top of the bucket part is scrubbing against the top of washer or what but something is causing it to flake off. I will attach a pic of the inside.. notice in the pic the top part of the bucket. Wasn't expecting this to happen after just 6 months. Hopefully, it won't come apart anymore than it has😏 but the good news is that it's still washing the clothes just fine👍",

    "text": "Our 6 year old dryer was so loud it sounded like a freight train every time we spun it. Literally, while I was on the phone with my husband one day, I asked where he was because it sounded like he was driving somewhere next to a train track with a train going by. When he told me he was home, and I came home to see that he was sitting in the breakfast room (next to the laundry room), with the door closed and the dryer running. I was really surprised. I knew that the dryer was loud, but didn't realize it was THAT loud until I heard it over the phone. We had gotten used to it I guess.<br /><br />Initially, I thought of buying a new dryer but then I came across some info about a quick and easy fix for loud dryers. I was unsure this was going to work but thought $40 bucks- no big deal. It took me two hours to fix it by myself but OMG was it worth it- especially considering the HOURS and HOURS of loud obnoxious dryer noises we've been listening to! Honestly, I may have been able to replace just ONE of the dryer rollers to fix it, but this kit came with almost everything that could possibly be the cause of loud noises. So I just replaced it all- JUST in case. Especially because I'd rather not have to take the dryer apart again! SOOOOO WORTH IT. Now, I actually forget that the dryer is even on. It worked THAT well- not even exaggerating.<br /><br /> Note: I'm a petite Mom (5'1\" and 124lbs). Somewhat handy. and I was able to do it myself by watching/following YouTube videos. I find instruction manuals to be confusing so I like to watch YouTube- it took a couple different videos because there wasn't a thorough video on my specific dryer. But I followed them step-by-step and it was easy. The \"heavy\" parts were not that heavy IMO. However, I did have 2 hours of kid-free time. lol. And I even got to clean the lint from the dryer/lint container which has bothered me for quite some time.",

The problem is that is what is available.<br /><br />So I searched for a way to eliminate bends, minimize the amount of flex, eliminate the possibility of clogging, and do everything I could to keep the lint and dust off the laundry room floor.<br /><br />I liked the look of this product and with the exception of the depth of the fitting it worked perfectly.  My dryer may be different than yours, but the frame of the dryer steps out (is deeper front to back) on the left side of the vent discharge.  If the throat of the pipe had been a little longer or even perhaps adjustable (like pvc drain kits), then there would have been plenty of room and the dryer would not have interfered with the dust pipe .  As you can see in the last picture, I had to place this piece on slightly at an angle.  The part that allows the flex to attach to the elbow is brilliant.  It softens the transition to the flex as well as prevent lint from escaping at the connection.  The other thing this fitting does is extend back so that the flex pipe can't be crushed.<br /><br />I used a simple elbow where the pipe passes through the exterior wall. Now the short flex duct is straight with no bends.  I used foil tape to secure the ends of the flex.  It's been a month or so, and so far no dust has escaped after numerous loads of clothes have run through the dryer.<br /><br />This is definitely worth buying, and would be a 5 if the fitting was just a little longer.  This project didn't take very long and will save me from moving the washer and dryer and cleaning all the lint off the floor.",

However, the new pump does work well.<br /><br />No instructions are included but the install is pretty straightforward.  YouTube videos typically have you try to access the pump from under the dishwasher, but I found it was easier to kill power, turn off water, disconnect supply+drain, then pull out the dishwasher and put it on its side.<br /><br />Initially I thought the wiring clip from the dishwasher wouldn't fit into the new pump, but then I found a cable that did.  Not sure whether it was included with the new pump or if I'd taken it off of the dishwasher while disassembling.

    "text": "This is the part # for our 11 year old GE refrigerator but this auger's measurements are different than the part I was replacing. I had bought another, cheaper auger on Amazon that also had problems with measurements. Other users recommended grinding down the metal rod.  I did not have a grinder so I returned that one. After installing this auger with all my original pieces it was binding some place. Couldn't see where. Auger would manually turn with extreme difficulty. I knew the motor could burn out if I reinstalled the housing it the way it was. I searched YouTube and checked the schematics for this part. My original auger had 2 metal washers plus a plastic spacer at the end closest to the plastic spirals.  Different schematics showed either 2 plastic spacers or 1 plastic spacer; no metal washers I finally found a couple on YouTube that demonstrated the difference in measurements on their auger.  They also had 2 metal washers. He was able to grind down the dent on the rod to allow all his original pieces to fit including the 2 metal washer. I was ready to return this auger as I did not have a grinder. I should not have to be a machinist to get a part to work. Taking a chance I put everything back on the rod in proper order except for the 2 metal washers. Everything works great. Ice cubes come out and cubes get crusher almost better than before.  Have been using for about a week without any problems. Very happy except this took me much more time to figure out than required. Without this issue it would have taken less than 20 minutes for total install and a 5 star rating. Something in the specs for this auger has changed over the last 11 years.",

    "text": "The part number sent was correct for the refrigerator model; however, the rod would need to be ground down in order for the original washers/spacers to fit on properly as others have noted.  I don't have a grinder and my attempts to modify with a wetstone were not successful.  I returned this part and ordered another auger, OEM, and paid twice as much but still had a similar issue.  Watched YouTube videos; checked schematics. My original auger had 2 metal washers plus a plastic spacer on the rod just before the plastic spirals started.  Schematics and videos showed 1 spacer or sometimes 2 spacers.  One YouTube video showed that the measurements were different between end of rod and the notch in the rod right before the plastic started.  Apparently there was a change in mfg specs at some point in time.  My refrig is 11 years old.  I couldn't make this part work and so returned it but managed to get the OEM auger to function by removing the 2 metal washers after seeing the YouTube video and checking the measurements.  I can now get ice cubes plus crushed ice.  Taking it apart and putting back together was not difficult but getting it to work properly was. May work fine for newer refrigerators.",

If I can do it, you can definitely do it!<br /><br />Have had GE Stove since 1997.<br />Surface burners stopped lighting themselves 10 years ago.<br />Appliance repair was going to cost too much and decided to temporarily use a candle lighter.<br />Watched YouTube videos. Thought about fixing it myself.<br />5 years ago put this in my cart and then moved it to \"Save for Later\".<br />Bought at least 4 more candle lighters including the new USB plasma ones that works great.<br />1 year ago, oven stopped working. Luckily have combination micro/convection oven to bake things in, though tiny compared to full size oven. Microwave was installed too high so had to get on step ladder to safely use it as an oven.<br />2 months ago, decided to buy stove. Prices going up due to tarriffs. Didn't like price nor thinner sheet metal on newer stoves compared to the tank I bought 20+ years ago.<br />3 month ago, finally bought this part, \"Used-Very Good\" from volgacom. Took a gamble since part plus shipping was so much cheaper from volgacom vs new from Amazon with free shepping.<br />3 days later received good as brand new part. No signs of wear or use. SCORE!<br />Waited 2 more months. Though replacing this thing was going to be complicated.<br /><br />Yesterday, decided to make repair. Didn't have to dismantle burners. as anticipated from YouTube videos.<br />Module is located behind control panel. 8 screws later, I was in. Only two wires to disconnect from old module and reconnect to new module. Snaps in place. Done. Put panel back together, restored power to stove.<br />First try, all burners spark and light as if the stove were brand new.<br /><br />Will update review with longevity of part. Very happy with part and volgacom as the supplier. Like used parts not only saving money but also reducing carbon footprint.",

Only problem that I faced was the ice maker had some cubes blocking rotation of the fingers and I could not align the shaft with the mating controller until I used a hair dryer to partially melt the cubes. That took about three minutes.<br /><br />Gears on the synchronous motor jammed and that prevented the ice maker from cycling.<br /><br />This control device has a puny looking synchronous motor compared to the original. See the attached pictures.<br /><br />The rest of the story: I followed the advice to others by one of the repair/parts sellers on the Internet. The repair person gave assurance that the \"no ice/no water to ice maker\" problem would be solved by replacing the water dispenser/ice maker solenoid on the back side of the side-by-side. So, I spent the $80 on the solenoid and still no ice - no water to ice maker. Next, I did the emitter and receiver replacement thing. Still, no ice.<br /><br />I embarked upon trying to replace this module, only to find that I had to buy an assembly or an entire new ice maker for hundreds of dollars. No place could I find the parts for my Whirlpool GSF26C5. The module was listed with parts suppliers as discontinued. I found that other Whirlpool models were listed as having the identical ice maker and evidently, those were newer models. So, I began the search and after searching various model numbers, the basic ice maker came up. When entering that ice maker part, this Amazon module came up as a stand-alone part.<br /><br />The replacement emitter was $150 on Amazon and I will probably be returning that part for credit.",

I purchased via Amazon to replace my lower rack and the replacement part is cheaply made, lacks the fold down tines that allow one to place large items in the dishwasher. Also lacks the flip down side cover for the front to back rack that accommodates small items. The price is outrageous and the manufacturer has saved money by eliminating the aforementioned accoutrements. I purchased my first replacement rack about three years ago and it was to OEM specs. So, this is my third replacement rack. The only positive about this experience is that I now know that Maytag, et al, are cheap companies, totally profit driven with no customer concern. My next dish washer will be one of the foreign makes - and I don't mean Chinese!",

I use this to remove the moisture from clothes between washing and drying to save energy. It works. I have had this for over 2 years and has been completely reliable. The unit needs a towel underneath when draining because it makes a lot of water spray. And a user also needs at least a couple of bowls to catch the water.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Dries clothes well.<br />2) Reliable.<br />3) Well-made.<br />4) Dries fast.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Unit needs to be wiped down after using, otherwise it can tarnish/rust.<br />2) If the clothes are unbalanced inside, the unit can vibrate wildly.<br />3) Somewhat small capacity, especially if you use a lot of towels.<br />4) You need several empty bowls to catch the drain water, as it comes out really rapidly.",

Once the cooler was plugged in it took about an hour and we had cold water to drink. The hot water feature was ready to go in about 30 minutes, and we were able to get steaming hot water from the water cooler! There is also a safety feature on the hot water button so little ones can't burn themselves! The cooler has a LED night light that can be turned on and off which makes it a great extra feature! The unit is quiet and you only hear a slight noise right after you fill your cup and then it quiets again. I will keep everyone posted on the cooler.",

I love the little freezer drawer, it is a great place to freeze bread or baked goods that you do not want to put with the rest of the items in the freezer bc it can get squashed...love it!<br /><br />It is a 19 Cu Ft. so it is not a huge fridge, my only complaint is I wish that the door shelves in the fridge would fit a full gallon container!",

What happened is hot steam and coffee shot up through the valve and all over me.  So I went to the standard method.  Love that it does not drip.  I have tried metal filters before and don't like trying to clean the tiny particles out of them.  So I wet down a paper filter and stuck that over the metal filter.  I got an excellent cup of coffee (nothing espresso like).  Clean up was a breeze, just like it is with a paper filter and the standard cap.  Just pop it into the garbage.  I did have an issue with it sticking too far down into my coffee mug, so I cut a hole out of a plastic jar lid and using that as a spacer it solved my problem.  Long story short, with a few tweaks I really like this and compared to other similar items, it is a good price.  I also wish to thank whoever packaged this in a sturdy little box!  Now that Amazon is shipping a lot of stuff in the wimpy plastic bags, a lot of items arrive beat up, bent, etc.  The little box protected the item well.

    "text": "I'm one of those that usually prefers to buy the &#34;name brand&#34;, especially when it comes to a water filter. The last house we lived in, we bought all new Frigidaire appliances, and I would only replace the fridge's water filter with PureSource replacements. Because the model was newer than what I have now, finding them on Amazon for a reasonable price wasn't hard.<br /><br />However, that's no longer the case for the older Frigidaire I own now. Searching on Amazon for WF1CB or RG-100 turns up a ton of generic brands. The only PureSource options are from resellers at prices that cost 5-7 times more. Based on reviews, I decided to take a chance on Refresh. I'm definitely glad I did! The item came well-packaged and sealed in plastic. After installing the filter and running 4 gallons of water continuously through it (roughly 6-7 minutes), the water was coming out crystal clear. The chemical taste that was starting to develop under the old filter was gone, not a trace of it remained! The kids even commented that they noticed a big difference!<br /><br />I went with the single pack this time around, but you can bet I'll be saving money on a 3-pack next time around, now that I know I can trust the brand. Buy with confidence!",

    "text": "The item arrived exactly as described in its retail packaging. At first, there was a lot of air to purge from the system as I ran the recommended 5-6 gallons of water through the filter to prime it. Strangely, the water that first came out was greenish-blue in color. It didn't smell like other users reported in some of the negative reviews, but the first 32 ounces or so were definitely off-color. My refrigerator is about 9 months old, and this is the 1st time I've had to replace the filter. It doesn't seem like the original filter that came with the fridge did that, but maybe it did. Other than that initial hiccup though, seems to be functioning normal and I'm happy with the price.<br /><br />Update (03/10/16):<br />Thought I'd provide an update. First, the water quality greatly improved after the first week. Six months later, I needed a replacement. After doing so from another listing, I noticed that the next one didn't have any issues when priming (no greenish-blue discharge this time). So I've dropped this one from 5 to 4 stars. No major issues, but not perfect.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the suggested retail price of $73+ is bogus. Walk into any retail store that sells Frigidaire appliances, and you'll find this filter being sold for less than $50. Base the deal you're getting off of that.",

The lights work surprisingly well too. They use 430 stainless which is magnetic, so I'm assuming that it could rust if left in the wrong condition, yet I have encountered no problems to date. The only downside is that it's a bit louder than I'd like, but for 600 CFM I really can't complain. And, I mostly use the quiet setting which still allows for normal voice conversations whereas on the high setting you pretty much can't hear yourself think.

The Kitchen Aid owners manual gave very little info about the filters, but I was able to match my model with one of the Whirlpool filters, which I ordered.  Next time, I'll order a multi-pack (a small discount) since I now know this is the correct replacement part.",

This UV gel dryer is a great size and fits my whole hand inside. It comes with two settings: low and high, as you just press the button in the direction of which you prefer. The off button is in the center. The red button is the 120 second (2 minute) timer. You turn your device on and to whatever setting and press that button and it will turn the device off when done.<br /><br />I applied a thin layer of base coat to my nail and let it cure for 2 minutes. Then I applied a thin layer of gel polish and let it cure for 2 minutes. I repeated the same step until I got the desired opacity. Afterwards, I touched it softly to see if the polish was dry and noticed it was very slightly still not dry (a light print of my fingerprint) so I put the top coat on and cured for about 5 minutes. It was completely dry by then, as I used thin coats and cured between so that it wasn't completely wet on bottom and dry just on top and smudge. I am very happy with this curing lamp, as it is my first. It is great quality plastic and the bottom of the inside of the lamp slides in/out for your convenience. It also comes with a US plug so no adapters needed. Just plug and play!<br /><br />I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.",

    "title": "Paper Filters Only Work With Keurig Coffeemakers",
    "text": "Read the description carefully. These disposable coffee filters are for “Keurig, compatible with K Cup filter”.  I assumed that they would work with non-Keurig single coffee machine reusable filter cups.  I was wrong.  They indeed do fit a reusable Keurig filter cup (See last photo)(I actually still have one from when I owned a Keurig).  However, when I tried it with my CHEFMAN single coffee maker, the paper filter is too small, even with stretching out the sides.  I ended up with a huge coffee mess when I opened the lid.  I did tap the sides of the filter cup before opening, but coffee still went over the paper filter.  For the most part, the cleanup was easier than without a paper filter.  If the coffeemaker is not a Keurig, the paper filters won't fit exactly.<br /><br />In Conclusion:  Make sure you own a Keurig before ordering.<br />Why did I give it 4 stars since I am the one who made the mistake?  I think the description should state”Doesn't work with non-Keurig coffeemakers”.",

    "title": "Powerful Electric Cooktop",
    "text": "I ordered this simply for a couple of reasons: 1) Family likes cooking hot pot on special occasions and 2) Don't want to use our gas stove since we have solar.  There are some positives and negatives for this cooktop.  I used it for a week now and found that it has certain limitations.<br />What I Observed:<br />1) The actual cooking area is 8.25 inches in diameter.  It takes ANY kind of material for your pots/pans, unlike induction cooktops which won't take certain material.<br />2) It heats up fast!  I stir fried some veggies within 10 minutes.  With that in mind, it gets hot fast.  Would I buy this if I still had a toddler in the house? NO, unless I am constantly guarding it.  The bottom and edge don't get hot, but the center glows red (which could be too intriguing for little kiddos)<br />3) The cord is only 31 inches long.  We had to use an extension cord for hot pot at the table.<br />4) There are 5 settings: Warm, Lo, Medium, Hi, and Sear.  There's a chart in the Instructions Manual of what each is capable of doing.  I found that I only had to use the setting one below the recommended to get the job done.<br />5) One drawback of this electric cooktop is that it's Maximum Run time is ONE HOUR.  After which you have to let it cool down before using again.  It hampers when using for hot pot or if everything you're cooking takes longer than one hour.  Hence, the 4 stars.<br />6) It is 120 V, 60 Hz, and 1200 W, pretty powerful.  Maybe that's why you can only use it for one hour at a time.<br />7) One year warranty<br /><br />My conclusion is that it's a good electric cooktop for fast cooking under an hour.  Good as an extra burner.  My son will inherit this when he goes to college.  The price is very reasonable.",

    "text": "I have to be honest and say that I didn't really notice the difference between these coffee filters and the ones I get from my grocery store.  Except for the price.  The instructions on the back of the package appears to be recommending that these filters be used for non-coffee machines.  I instead use these in my Mr. Coffee personal one cup coffeemaker.  Since the filter is cone-shaped, it didn't fit exactly in my filter container.  I had to fold it a little bit to get it to fit.<br /><br />Each filter is made of virgin pulp of the “Abaca” non-wood Manila hemp.  It doesn't have an odor.  It's 5 inches tall and 7 inches in diameter when opened up.  The paper has a slight crinkle to it.  I would say the quality is excellent and gets a five star rating from me.  However, I don't think my budget would allow $7 a month for coffee filters- that would come out to $84 a year, if I drank coffee every day.",

Wishing I could take back all those many grueling trips to the laundromat I made, when I know now that I didn't need to. Other than when I take a shower, this amazing little machine lives in my shower stall, where I have it sitting on 4 plastic bed risers, just because I don't like the idea of an electric appliance sitting in water as it drains. It's easy enough to lift in and out of the shower stall, as it only weighs 26 lbs. I wash my single queen size sheets one at a time, and they come out beautifully. The spin side of this thing is crazy powerful and does an amazing job of wringing out every little last bit of water in whatever I just washed. If you watch a few videos about it on YouTube, you'll know exactly what to do, and see how amazingly simple it is to operate. DON'T HESITATE... BUY IT TODAY! : )",

A bra came out completely covered in lint and I waited for it to dry and then wet my hand and rubbed the lint off of the bra. Possibly if the clothes went to a dryer after this the lint would blow into a lint trap, but in hang drying clothes after spin cycle they have lint clung to them.

No where in the instructions or product description did it say to leave that part in place. So I removed it like you do when you use the grey basket with screw on lid that comes with the Keurig, water went every where.  So, don't remove it. Just line up one of the holes on the bottom with the spike. Very simple, the lid will not close if the container isn't lined up. It actually almost falls in place. The level line inside the cups is very hard to see so 3 level scoops of coffee is about right. Don't fill over the mess screen. I hope this review helps someone, it was really kind of comical on my first try having the spike device removed. :o)<br />So please add this to your instructions on the side of the box<br /><br />I'm also changing this review to 4 stars. The reason is that the cups are not easy to clean. If you leave it over night, you really have a problem removing the coffee grinds. So now I clean it as soon as the coffee brews. Also, I have noticed when using Folgers or any other coffee, there is always what I call coffee residual in the bottom of your cup.",

I've used pipe ties (similar to what discount stores use to put pairs of shoes together) for the second trap -- but going forward, it's easier to buy a brand that supplies a tie for each trap.",

Over the years I got tired of occasionally letting it boil dry (got distracted), scorching the handle or otherwise committing early-morning mayhem.  Back to Ready Joe, this time coupled with an electric kettle.  I was disappointed that, unlike other Melita plastic filter cones, this one did not indicate it was BPA-free.  Maybe it is, or maybe it is impossible to make it both red and BPA-free. Vaguely unsettling. #4 filers work best, as does pouring only a small amount of water over the grounds to let it bloom before pouring the rest of the water in (also helps keep the water from draining through the grounds and filer too fast.) After seven months, with regular washing in the dishwasher and less regular by hand, it looks slightly faded and scratched (maybe I should worry more about BPA). I don't find the view hole particularly helpful -- maybe it would work if I poured the water while sitting at the kitchen table.  As it is -- a tall person standing at the kitchen counter --- I have to  do some special contortions to view the coffee level in the cup. Not worth it. But it is cheerful, convenient, and poses less danger to barely-awake coffee-makers than do other methods.",

When I do re-model, this range hood is staying because I believe it will look good with any type of cabinets, wall colors etc.<br />The installation wasn't exactly easy. The provided instructions are pretty much useless. I had to run electric to the proper area since my kitchen did not have any type of exhaust over the range in the past. For now, I'm using it in the vent-less mode. I plan on running the vent through the attic and to a roof vent. This will wait for nicer weather. I dented the stainless extension in the process of removing the protective film, be careful with this. The film is stuck on pretty good, comes off in one piece but you really gotta pull so be careful how you are holding the stainless. My installation with electric took about 4 hours, keep in mind I haven't installed the ext. vent as of yet.<br />I like the led lights and the fan isn't terribly loud. The power off button has about a 1 minute delay, not the 2 to 3 minutes as the booklet suggests. It would be nice to have the option for a longer delay, like 10 minutes.",

This fit the bill - it is compact, but not toy sized.  Mine has casters and adds to the portability (a few reviewers mentioned that their machines did not include casters).  The washer is very quiet (slightly louder than a vibrating cell phone), so it can be used at night without disturbing my neighbors.  You can only launder small loads, but I knew this before I bought the washer.  This is not a deal breaker for me.  If you need a small footprint washer, this is an excellent choice.  The set-up was quick and easy; screw on the bottom plate and casters, then connect the hose to the machine (and faucet).  It took more time to read the instructions than the actual set-up.  The wash cycles vary; my go to is the quick wash at about 20-minutes from cycle start to end.  The spin cycle is excellent - no dripping clothes.",

Let the grounds dry a bit, turn upside down over trash bin and give a couple of hits, then use your pointer finger to run around the inside and push what's clinging to the sides and very bottom into the trash.

I am a newbie to this, so it very well could have been my fault.  Also towards the end of the PBR, every time I poured a beer, it had a big air pocket that shot out wildly before pouring correctly.  Again, probably my fault. A 5 gallon bucket did the trick.  I have kicked both kegs and this time I am going to try adding a second regulator.",

I'd be willing to pay 10 dollars more if there was a gasket on the outside of the inlet and outlet, around the closer (door) and on the inside of the little lid. These things leak air like crazy. I use thin foil heat tape and wrap every possible area that might leak. The zip ties do nothing, there is nowhere for them to grip to. There is no lip to keep it from sliding off. Taped that too. The door that swings with the adjuster leaks air too. It's fine in the winter. Horrible in the summer. I also had to tape over the screen and around the lid to seal it. I'll just remove the tape for winter.<br /><br />I spent 40 minutes taping and testing. It's on and working like it should but one should not have to put so much time and effort into such a simple contraption. I do recommend these boxes but you have to have realistic expectations.

    "text": "I was loving our lil ice machine at first, not having to constantly go to the store for ice was awesome. I ordered it on 9-8-21 but within a few days it stopped working so Amazon/Seller shipped a replacement promptly(delivered on 9-29-21). I have been using it every day or two and the only complaint I really had is that it would still have 1/3 tank of water left but it would stop and I'd have to keep filling to the basket(not a biggie). I have been cleaning the machine 2-3 times a week with vinegar (sometimes bleach on a q-tip in hard to reach areas). Since it had sat for 2 days without making ice (instructions call for cleaning if sitting w/o making ice for more than two days) Inwas cleaning the machine with my normal routine of vinegar & after a bit of bleach on q-tips for hard to reach nooks/crannies. I and noticed the q-tips would have a tan substance while I was drying around the lil hole perforated square price in bottom right corner (where the water gets pulled up through a tube or channel to the top in order to start the ice making process). I wondered if I could detach it and it popped out, I got nauseous when I saw what was under it, hidden away. I sprayed a bit of bleach kitchen cleaner in the area and after a few seconds I took a q-tip to it and around the hole where the water enters and almost vomited when it looked like a bunch of stringy snot on the end of the q-tip🤢. I had to keep going over & over it w/q-tip and each time I pulled it up more & more came out🤢. I have been queasy ever since, all I can think about is put clean, filtered water in the tank but that was useless because it was being pulled through that hole/tube/channel I order to get the after to the top where the lil freezing cones are. We put that ice in every iced drink and used in our coolers. Of course the return window has closed because Amazon uses the date the first defective machine was ordered not the date the replacement was sent so I guess the $109 I spent hoping for fast, clean ice will go straight to the recycling center or to the dump. There is NO WAY I will EVER use this machine again. I still cannot understand how it got that disgusting since I used only filtered water or purified water & cleaned it per the instructions. Sorry for the bad review but I have to be honest while at same time send a warning to others who own this same machine (probably other ice machines as well). Please check under the square you might be surprised at what your “clean” ice machine might be hiding in the parts you cannot see.",

    "text": "Like everyone else our Lowe's French door Samsung fridge started leaking water under the drawer and behind the freezer. The most important step when replacing this is to be patient and get the ice out of the drain tube. We used a hair dryer to melt most of it. Then we poured hot water from the kettle into it. Let the water fill up the V drain on the sides of the drain hole and wait. After about ten minutes of adding water it finally broke loose and drained out fast. Then put this in and put it back together. If you just add this you'll probably have the same problem because there's 3 feet of ice in that tube. It's a ridiculous design but this will get you back to liking your fancy fridge.",

We've given away our unused K-cups, bought a Shardor coffee grinder for beans and a Shardor herb grinder for loose tea. Also, we found a great powdered spiced Chai Tea mix.  We can grind and brew our coffee and loose leaf tea perfectly now.  All of the brewing is done with this reusable filter, standard water temp (192-degrees F), customized proportions of beans, leaf tea and Chai mix.

Though I've enjoyed the Solofill experience for the most part, there was just no way I could get around it's physical limitations.

I thought maybe it would be good for if I hit the store while I still have a couple left before needing the next container but it just didn't make sense. I bought these because they hold 12 each and came in a 2-pack option for a reasonable price. I'm also a big mDesign fan and they have great customer service.<br />Just be careful putting the eggs in, one slipped out of my fingers a bit too soon and it broke as it hit the hard plastic.

I got this because my refrigerator's ice maker is dying. Other reviews led me to believe it makes a ton of ice. No it doesn't!! Also, the cubes are hallow, so each cube isn't going to last very long in a drink, anyway.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed, I'm just going to buy a bag of ice every week to dump into my ice maker in my freezer.",

The drip pans have become increasingly stained & difficult to clean over the past couple of years since I moved in. Rather than spend hours scrubbing them with steel wool and/or soaking them to only get half of the stains off, I just decided to buy new ones. This set is reasonably priced, and buying these has saved me hours of frustration & lots of arm/hand pain from scrubbing. Totally worth it to have clean drip pans that aren't fire hazards & save me from the risk of losing any of my security deposit due to ruining them.  They fit perfectly; I had no issues at all. Picture of my stove w/ the new drip pans is included for visual reference of the oven type; I have no idea what the actual model is since I did not purchase it.",

It was the perfect dimensions that I required for my washing machine. It comes in 3 separate pieces but its very easy to snap together. What I do like a lot is that each basket has a lid that may be removed if you don't wish to use it. I removed the middle lid as it was a bit intrusive for anything large that would be placed in it. I kept the outside ones in place. When the lids are opened, they are flush and go straight up, creating a high back wall. This is great for putting larger items in the sides and not just in the middle rack. the sides are just as tall the handle in the middle, but they don't get in the way. The quality appears to be on par with what I had in there originally when it was in it's prime condition. Considering what this does, I don't mind the price. it sure beats using plastic tie straps to try to cover up the holes on the old one.",

Get a better purchase from a reliable company who actually cares about their product and customer support. It sucks and I regret this purchase heavily.<br /><br />I replaced the belts and it's gotten so much worse it's a danger. I reached out to Panda and seller and won't get a response. JUNK JUNK JUNK.",

I read the specs on this Waterdrop and decided it was a better price for teh features I wanted.  I looked though the reviews and saw teh occasional problem with slow water flow.  So, when I got them I looked at the hole on top (some users said it was smaller).  See the pics.  At first blush, it looks smaller, but if you look inside (to the black part) they are the same size where the water goes in.<br />Same as with other filters I prefill it before installing it.  Manufacturers make no mention of this, but it helps avoid all that sputtering and splashing until the air is out.  Once installed, I timed the flow for 1 liter.  15 seconds in my fridge - exactly the same as the old filter (well, at least out to the second).  Good enough for me.  Water looks clear, and tastes ok.  It is nto well water, so I'm mostly doign this becuase I think it filters out chlorine (in reality probably does not)",

I have gone back to bottle water and am filling the ice bin with store bought ice for now. I paid for this “better” filter to try and reduce contaminants for a member of our household who has immune problems. I am seriously concerned that using this filter is actually making this person sicker! I flushed and cleaned the entire refrigerator water system without the filter, and then reinstalled, but the taste is still there. I cannot recommend this filter. If I had not thrown out the original box, I would definitely return this item.

It's just a laminated poster, which is exactly what I need. It works okay with dry erase, but it comes off easily so if you write new things on the board, it'll rub off if you're not careful - which is why they recommend the wet-erase markers. I ordered the vis-a-vis markers (as they suggested) and they are perfect, a lot longer lasting which is great for the calendar. I love having my whole semester laid out for me so I know exactly what is due when. My only regret is that I didn't order these years ago to have them throughout school! I highly recommend. :)",
