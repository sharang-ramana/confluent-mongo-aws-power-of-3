    "text": "Don't waste your money. It stopped working after a day having it. I did everything right. I called the number after a few days long as it was still under warranty. I had to cut the cord off (which I couldn't do myself so my bf had to as I have severe ra in my hands). They made me cut the cord and spend 15 dollars to mail it to them. Took them weeks to accept my package of my cord (I made sure I got the signature required as proof it was mailed and they got it). Weeks later I finally get contacted they will mail me another ice maker. As soon as I plugged the replacement one in, it was making loud noises (yes it had water up to the line etc) and it took it 3 hours to make 3 little ice cubes. I email the lady who I dealt with via email about the first one and she wouldn't email me back. I'm sorry but for the price of this ice maker, I shouldn't have to spend a ton of money to mail them the cord. That should of been paid for by them not me. Anyhow she never got back to me at all and I gave up at that point. I figured I would just end up having to cut the cord again and spend that money to mail it and wait weeks again etc for them to send me yet another crap ice maker. I went to bjs and got a Frigidaire icemaker and way cheaper and haven't had a single issue with that one.",

This is much cheaper, and I can tell you for a fact my Kenmore is made by Whirlpool.  They just give it a different part number.  Probably exact same part on the assembly line.",

    "text": "This product worked perfectly with a few modifications. If you get this part and it doesn't seem to fit and bends slightly outward at the ends, then read on (and be ready to grab a file or hacksaw).<br /><br />A few other reviewers have mentioned the protruding circular knobs near each end of the part. For our specific Whirlpool refrigerator, there must have been a minor design change since there were no detents for this protrusion to fit into causing the part to bend slightly inward -- enough for the drawer not to fit.<br /><br />As others have said, once these small plastic knobs were removed (personally, I used a small hacksaw to remove the protruding bit), the part worked exactly as the original part.<br /><br />Even though my satisfaction with the part rates a 5-star review, I decided to give this 1-star because of the way I typically read ratings. If I see an average rating of 4-5 stars, I might read one or two, but then I focus on the lower-rated reviews to get a better idea of problems with the product that the others may not have seen.<br /><br />If you're reading this, then, just a heads-up that you may need to slightly modify the part in order to get it to fit -- then it's a 5 of 5.",

    "text": "What do you say about this item? Well I gave it a five star because it deserves a five star. It really does work great. But understand… That no one buyer mentalist is going to like this item. But then again no environmentalist should own a Keurig!  lol<br /><br />You can look at my pictures and see how easy it is to do and everybody likes fresh ground coffee as opposed to coffee that's been sitting in a pod for who knows how long.<br /><br />It's also exceptional in the fact that it does not leak.  I have a reusable pod that I can just put coffee grounds in and put it in my pot. But then the water always leaks all over the place.  I like the fact that this product has a tight seal and does not leak.<br /><br />The question remains then is this a good deal for the price?  I guess you have to figure that out for yourself! To each their own.<br /><br />After using the pod I took it apart to see if I could reuse it may be one or two times to make it more worth the cost.  The answer is no you cannot reuse it. Which is fine it says it's disposable. But we're always trying to cut corners right?<br /><br />Another positive thing about this item is you get 25 pads that you literally, if you wanted to could make them all up for the entire week with fresh ground coffee. The seal is so tight that you don't have to worry even if you drop it that it's going to bust open in your coffee's going to go all over the place. And I think for a week it would still retain fresh flavor.<br /><br />Whoops I buy this again? Well I really don't even like my coffee maker that much. I got the coffee maker for free last Christmas and I'm always aggravated that you have to pay so much for pods. It's also not that great when you're having a get together, because making one cuppa coffee at a time can be quite aggravating when you've got 40 people here.  So I just don't know. I guess if the price was right I might buy them just for personal use. That being said I look forward to this coffeepot dying all together. Then I can just go back to the regular old coffee pot.<br /><br />If this is something you're looking for and feel comfortable in your purchase. It really does work very well.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review… And that's the only thing I'll give.",

So these are a great substitute at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />I replace them on the first of every month. Just take out the old filter, run the new one under cold water, then soak it for about 10 minutes before you insert it into the machine. Easy peasy, right? But taking the time to actually do this step really enhances your coffee drinking experience many times over. It helps get rid of any metallic taste you might find in municipal water, and instead your favorite cup of joe is amazing and delicious, just like it should be. Highly recommended!",

What makes a Keurig unique is that it brews a cup of coffee faster and easier than any other method -- no carafe to clean, no filters to purchase, and no need to grind beans or measure ground coffee. Just pop in a K-cup and presto! In about two minutes you have coffee. Cleanup is restricted to your cup (and throwing away the used K-cup).<br /><br />Using a \"My K-cup\" filter assembly with your own coffee really defeats the purpose of having a Keurig. You have to remove the original assembly (don't lose it!), measure your own coffee (which takes adjustment; you'll probably go through several cups of coffee before you get the measurement to your satisfaction), and clean everything up afterward (it can make a bit of a mess). This is really about as much trouble as just using a conventional little drip coffeemaker. In fact, to me it is MORE trouble, although I think the Keurig uses a bit less coffee and could save some money.<br /><br />So there you have it. Using a Keurig in the conventional way is the most convenient but also the most expensive way to brew coffee, but using a My K-cup filter saves money at the expense of the convenience.",

I don't post many reviews at all, but I just had to about this product. It isn't a bogus review.  If you are on fence or worried it is not worth the money, I PROMISE you will love it.

The read outs can be a little intimidating at first but the manual is well written and ultra explanatory. The machine cleans beautifully, you can use the washer independent of the dryer and vice versa. There are steaming options heavy soil, light soil options. It's worth every penny and quite frankly, better than any plain washing machine I've ever used. The compact design is excellent, though it isn't a huge drum and as with any washer, you shouldn't jam pack the drum too tightly. It does run on 110v and can use additional power to operate but it doesn't need to be vented, can fit quite nicely into tight spaces and really gets your clothes clean with a minimum of detergent and water. Worth it. Worth it. Worth it.",

    "text": "I've had my Keurig for 2 years, and my re-usable K-cup for 1 year.  It works perfectly just as it is, as long as you don't overfill it and follow the directions.<br /><br />Oh, wait...mine didn't HAVE directions.<br /><br />When I first got it, I won't lie...I screwed it all up.  The blasted thing didn't have directions, so I thought the cute little basket went right into the K-cup part of the Keurig.  I had not a clue that the black K-cup holder part with the needle that pokes the bottom of the K-cup had to come OUT of my Keurig to put the gray part in.<br /><br />I made a huge mess.<br /><br />So, here are the directions for everyone else, so you don't have to be a dummy like me:<br /><br />1.  That place in your Keurig where K-cups normally go?  Yeah, it actually comes out of the machine.  Really, it does.  There are three little tabs you have to push on the rim of it to pull it out.  Get that thing out of there.  It's not difficult, so if you're being rough with it, stop.  It comes out pretty easily.  Be careful you don't gouge yourself with the stabby-thingies in the machine.<br /><br />2.  Open up your reusable gray K-cup filter, wash it, and put about a tablespoon of coffee in there.  If you like it strong like me, I suggest a finer grind.  If you use Folgers, put it on a smaller cup setting or you won't get it very strong.  This little bugger is made for just one cup at a time (whereas I can usually get one big cup or two little cups out of a disposable K-cup).<br /><br />3.  PUT THE LID BACK ON (!!!) the gray K-cup filter and put it into the spot where the regular black one usually lives (amazing, it fits!).  Close it up and let 'er rip.<br /><br />4.  If you got coffee everywhere, you did something wrong.  I know, I know...I didn't want to believe it either.  Maybe you didn't put the lid on, or put the cute little basket into the machine without the gray part.  Whatever.  Either way, it's not the product's fault that you're dumb like me.  :o)  Start over, figure out what you messed up, and enjoy your coffee when you finally have that forehead-slap moment.",

These are also built with mounting retainer clips, so you can insert them into whatever you are putting them into. As you can see they vary slightly but their variable is so small its dismissive.

Just like clockwork, I filled the tank with water and whamo, it started dropping ice cubes into the tub on top of the reservoir - wooohooooo! I don't have to walk this body clear across the house to the kitchen freezer which barely makes any ice cubes or they jam up on the way out then spill all over the floor. This one is in our bedroom on a counter and color me happy! As you can see, the cubes are not clear but I don't care. I have a PUR filter water pitcher next to it, so after this water runs down I'll try to fill it with the filtered water and see if they come out clear. I was just too excited to think of doing that lol. I have severe chronic fatigue, like severe, so walking across the house just wears me plum out as well as out of breath. Plus I have agonizing pain from a bad back. Living in Hawai'i is hot year round and now, ooo la la! I have ice. Now let's hope this baby doesn't break down so I don't have to add an update to this review ♥ Did you color me happy? Make it pink with glitter cause that's what having ice close by makes me feel like.<br />***Update July 12, 2017*** It's broken. .Sigh. I wish this had not been too good to be true, but I think it is. I ALMOST got NINE months of ice cubes from this unit. Now I will begin the process of contacting the company to see what is covered, what isn't and how much this is going to cost me. I am no longer happy and covered in pink glitter. ***Update July 20, 2017 Company's customer service is fabulous. Easy to work with and made everything all better. If you have any problems, be sure to ask for help directly from the company***",

It doesn't make any more ice once the basket is full, the ice (if not used) melts and circulates back through to make more. The smaller ice will fit perfectly inside water bottles. Easy peasy to use and we are pleased with it!<br /><br />****UPDATE after using for a year<br />I wish I had gone with a different brand. Our replacement will be!

They give me good tasting, clean water that we use for drinking and cooking.  I can even guess at how much money I've saved over the 10 years I've owned this refrigerator but I know it significant.  We change the filters about 4 times per year.  Would probably need to change more often if we didn't also buy a lot of bottled water just for convenience.  Water flow is reduced as filter fills with contaminants so I know it is catching the bad stuff I don't want to drink.  We also drink a lot of coffee in my house and use the filtered water from refrigerator to make it.  I get noticeably better tasting coffee useing the water from these filters that's I do using tap water.

Given the room constraints I can only use it by filling the water reservoir as a bottle, even a 3 gallon bottle, is too tall.  The Kismile 3 in 1 Water Dispenser works great and looks very classy.<br /><br />I have a tall 5-gallon water dispenser in the kitchen which I am very happy with until this last week when I was informed that the only company (Primo) that offered 5 gallon empty exchange in my area has withdrawn all of their exchange locations.  So far, there has been no alternative so I fear my 5 gallon water cooler is going to become useless.  If you are wanting this to hold a 3, 4, 5, gallon bottle it might be wise to check your local area for available water exchange companies.

Occasionally when we're running a bit low and I want to make a pitcher of iced tea I'll use tap water so we still have water.  Every time I do I think of all of the current news stories involving dangerous or even poisonous tap water. I figured a filter, any filter, can only help.  The fact that this comes with a pitcher and a filter that can be used with the pitcher or with almost anything else you have in the house was a bonus.<br /><br />The pitcher is a serious disappointment to me.  If  were rating it alone, it'd get 1 star. The spout that closes for pouring has a gap in that allows water to pour out even when closed -- though it doesn't snap closed so if you bump the pitcher a little the spout flaps all around.  The plastic feels cheap.  It really need a different lid that doesn't pop off so easily.  That's the bad.<br /><br />The good is the filter itself is easy to use.  It can be used in almost any pitcher or bottle you have at home.  In fact If it's possible, I'd recommend buying the filter section without the pitcher.  It has markings so you can see what month you starting using the filter.  Although you CAN filter water fast, if you're not fond of wasting water I'd actually do it at a slower steady stream as the filter itself does not hold a lot of water so a lot of water is literally going down the drain as it pours out over the filter.  At a slower pace I filled the pitched quite a bit slower but wasted a lot less.<br /><br />In the end, I'd recommend the filter itself but not the pitcher.",

I've had a Senseo machine for years with eco-pods and stayed away from Keurig because of no eco solution. I only find these difficult to clean thoroughly. I do not have a dishwasher and hand washing I find no matter how thorough, still leaves coffee grain residue in the crannies. I use a toothbrush to try and get them completely clear and then I let them soak in hot water and vinegar. Other than that I find them a wonderful buy, great purchase for the price - especially getting four in the pack. Excellent purchase.",

    "text": "Our regular washer went down and it took 3 weeks to get the part in and the repair guy to come out. He fixed it, so we thought, and when I went to use it again it wasn't working. 3 more weeks of waiting was going to mean piles of clothes and nothing to wear. So I ordered this while we waited. In the past, I had an electric washer spinner that was great for RV life but I wanted something with no electrical components this time. This little washer was perfect and the right price. Yes, you could make something with a 5-gallon bucket and spin that around but then it would leak and you'd have all kinds of issues with that. This washer comes in cute colors (I got baby blue which makes me happy to look at) and is very lightweight. It was easy to put together and from box to washing the first load was under 15 minutes. It actually washed well too. The water was dirty after the first wash and I did it again to get any extra dirt out. You do need to wring out the wet clothes which is an extra step and a tad of a workout but I'm thrilled because the laundry piles have gone down. I turn on some music and spin for one song. It isn't hard on the arms but does feel nice to switch arms halfway through to get an even workout. Not that it is a mega workout just repeated movement. It really is very easy to spin. I just like to be even. I'm thrilled with this washer and so happy to have clean clothes. You can use warm water but not hot water.",

It doesn't feel cheaply made when you open and close the door as other models felt. Some reviewers complained about the noise, it does run through a short cycle but I don't find the noise to be overly loud or bothersome. My husband has also not complained about the noise. We've had no issues with it so far. As a warning, this fridge is a smidge taller than a standard cabinet so you need to take that into consideration when building it in.

I did ruin one not following directions and punctured the base screen, so now the remaining three have a permanent marker mark on the top so I line them up correctly.  I find I need two scoops of my coffee per reusable k-cup, rather than one for my single-cup French press, but it is worth it to me since the speed and convenience of each cup is far faster than the old press method.  I keep all three ready to go; I clean them out each night and reload for morning.",

What I'm going to have to do is buy some feet cushions that are thicker than the size that the wheels are longer than the feet.. That way I can move the appliance around and put the feet cushions under the feet, and the wheels will be off the ground..  With that setup the Appliance will still be very Sturdy on the floor..  I'm using it for a portable Washing Machine, when it goes into the Spin Cycle it has to be Level, and it'as placement on the floor has to be sturdy.  (Over All), it's a well built product, easy to assemble, has  Bubble Levels in each corner which is very handy, it's the only one of these that has that feature.

So I buy a filter list coffee holder and use a filter anyway yes it's just the second message to keep The girl the grounds are crowd up sorry I'm using Siri to write this and it gets them into the garbage can easier. However it works wonderful and I think it's just great to have this already my grounds on the ground in the kitchen :-) have dropped off drastically. But it works perfectly and I'm so delighted with this purchase.

On the top right side there's something that hangs down which wipes out the front part of two cans being visible. I found and maybe it was my own fault that it did not sit level so it was forced to be level by putting a small block under the first 2 feet so that it would lean backwards.If I had to buy this again I would've bought 120 canned version so just give me some more space to operate in. Things are very tight when you try to put the 60 cans that it says can fit it's just not so easy. I enjoy it however it sits in the corner of my kitchen and people get sodas out of it all the time I do enjoy it I just wish it wasn't so tightly made as far as trying to put the cans in there but a small price to pay.

So I'm saving myself about $25 it's a worthwhile investment.

    "title": "Top Rated By Me & Everything You Want To Know About This Washer",
    "text": "Kenmore 27\" Top-Load Washer with Triple Action Impeller and 4.8 Cubic Ft. Total Capacity, White is a very highly top rated machine by me. I will first tell you that I was a dry cleaning/laundry Inspector for half a decade, so you will know my expertise in my review of this beautiful machine. Before buying this washing machine, I owned a Whirlpool Calypso HE washer, which just died after 20 years of weekly use. The secret to keeping a machine running for 20 years- luck, use a surge protector that is made for washing machines (protects those circuit boards), run an empty load with a cup of vinegar to keep it clean inside at least once or twice a year and always load it properly with not too much soap. I do read reviews before buying anything here on Amazon and other websites and that helps greatly in my decision making.<br /><br />Before I received this machine, I measured all the doorways, as our house is small and have narrow doors. The machine is a hair over 27 inches wide, and my doorways 28 inches after removing the doors. Amazon delivered it perfect- being slow and careful having only close to ½ inch on each side of the doorways. I was very happy with Amazon's skilled delivery team. The set up takes a bit of time (I did this), as you want it as level as you can get it. I first hooked up the drain hose. There is a drain hose with clamp included, BUT, this drain hose is a very short 28 inches long, with the curved part that goes into the wash tub 23 inches long. The opening of the drain to this washer is on the back- bottom right side of this machine, 6 inches above the floor. I needed a 10 foot drain hose to go all the way behind the machine, along the side and up to the laundry tub, then into it. I ordered one here on Amazon which took a couple days. It's perfect! So, please note- DRAIN HOSE INCLUDED IS VERY SHORT! The good part was, they included 3 metal circular clamps that worked perfect on the 10 foot hose, so I only needed to buy the hose and use one of the clamps.<br /><br />I then, attached a grounding wire (our home is old), the water hoses (NOT INCLUDED) and plugged it in. Now, I adjusted the machine from the back wall (evenly on each side) to leave just enough room for the drain hose on the floor. When, I had it perfect, I marked around the machine corners on the floor with tape, so after moving it to adjust the legs, I can place it back perfectly. The legs of the machine can be adjusted on the legs- NOT the base feet on the floor, just above the base feet with a 3/4 inch wrench. You'll need a short 2 by 4 board to hold the washer up while adjusting the legs. Check every so often with a level on the sides and top (directions in booklet), until it's as level as you can get it. Now, turn on the water hoses, and while running your first load you can check for any leaks from the water lines and drain line.<br /><br />I opened the beautiful clear lid and loaded my laundry. When you load, place items in evenly around the center (not bunched up), and as you load, VERY lightly push down (as the tub tilts easily). You do not want clothes around the center that can fall over, making the machine out of balance. You always want to see the center of the tub when finished. The tub in this washer is a huge 23 inches wide by 20 inches deep. I then added my detergent- less than you think. I had to remove the liquid-only inside cup of the detergent drawer to just use powder. I use a few tablespoons per load. And should you need to rinse clothes before washing, there is a Faucet Button! Then, I closed the lid. Push Power, select the load- I first chose Towels (for towels, sheets, socks and underthings), the cycle came up Heavy Duty and the water very warm. I can also add a variety of other things such as Extra Rinse, or change the water temperature. Once ready, I hold the Start button for a couple seconds, as it counts down to zero. The lid locks and that's it.<br /><br />I watched all the cycles with this washer and this is where I was impressed. The spraying action comes from 9 jets all around the machine. The wash basket moves in a circular motion BOTH ways if it needs more balance. The impeller action moves it back and forth. And talk about the water fill- THE WATER COVERS THE CLOTHES! It takes time to clean so well with enough water- this load took about an hour and 15 minutes. As for my regular shirts, slacks, blouses and pants. I have always put these in net bags. I have all sizes from small to really big enough for a couple pairs of pants. I learned from my Inspector job that all machines can be rough on my regular clothing, but not with net bags. They keep my clothes perfect. I used the Delicate Load and only changed the Cold water to Warm. This load took 50 minutes. When done, the machine tells you on the LCD board. When I removed my clothes, I immediately noticed they smelled so clean and looked like new. I mean bright, beautiful colors with no dinginess. The difference from this washer to other Impellers- water that covers the clothes in both wash and rinse (my old Whirlpool mainly sprayed leaving dry spots, where I saw this one cover the clothes in water completely), No lint all over the clothes (my old machine left lint always), clothes are super bright and smell super clean and it takes more time to really clean clothes. As for blankets, this machine is outstanding with it's huge capacity. Just put it around the bottom evenly, gently pushing down and then wash on Bulky. My Queen Comforters came out beautiful, bright, clean and smelling lovely.<br /><br />The last thing I wanted to find out, is who made this machine and where? The model number that starts with 110 means it was made by Whirlpool. (Those that start with 417 are made by Frigidaire). Since 2017, Kenmore products have been made by other manufacturers. I was happy with this, as I've always liked Whirlpool. And it was made in Ohio, of course where the parts come from is another story. But being put together here in the USA also made me happy. This is a top rated machine by me, which gave me sparkling clean clothes from actually using more water. 5 STARS.",

    "title": "100% Accurate For Temperature And 99% Accurate For Humidity",
    "text": "I have owned several different Temperature/Humidity meters over the years. Since every room in the house has a different humidity reading depending on how many windows are in the room or which direction it faces, we always like to know the humidity to keep the rooms all more normal and similar. We have the worst humidity in a bedroom on the north wall with large windows. For anyone with any collectibles, keeping the humidity out of the room means not damaging your collectibles or items from too much damp or mildew.<br /><br />My brother has an expensive weather meter system, as he has a large collection of remote control planes- many fabric made, so I always have something 100% accurate to compare my meters to. This Amprobe Relative Humidity & Temperature Meter is actually the most accurate meter I have ever owned. We tested this inside, outside, even in crawl spaces and duct work to see the results. The temperature was always 100% accurate, whether it was ambient, dew point or wet bulb.<br /><br />As for the humidity temperature readings- we found this Amprobe to be off by 1/2 to 1 % depending on where the reading was taken.  Inside duct work- it was off by only 1/2 %, but in a room or outside it was off by 1%.  This is the most accurate meter I have ever owned. I had owned a Pyle meter that was always off by 6-10%, and a Fluke that was off by 4-6 % on the humidity readings. My best meter before this Amprobe was made by Ambient Weather- the humidity was off by just 2 %. The temperature readings on all my meters was always pretty accurate- it's the humidity readings that are never completely accurate.<br /><br />This Amprobe THWD-3 Relative Humidity and Temperature Meter comes with the meter itself, a removable protective metal sensor cap, black carrying case with belt loop, 9 V battery, User's Manual and a Wet Bulb Chart. There is an On/Off Switch- which automatically turns off should you forget to turn it off after 30 minutes. The Min/Max button allows you to use it for memory. The Hold button allows you to hold the present reading. The DP/WB button gives you the Dew Point Temperature or Wet Bulb Temperature- which came out 100% accurate. The last button is for your readings in either Celsius or Fahrenheit temperatures. There is also a Low Battery Warning picture.<br /><br />Besides being the most accurate Temperature/Humidity Meter I have owned to date, I found when you remove the protective metal sensor cap, the reading is given in a few seconds- way faster than with the cap on. You just have to take more care that the sensor is not damaged when the cap is off. This is a great, well made, extremely accurate temperature and humidity meter and is definitely worth 5 Stars, being the most accurate meter I have ever owned, and Amprobe even warrants this meter for a year, making it well worth buying.",

    "text": "I seriously think these stainless pour over coffee filters/drippers are one of the greatest inventions ever for coffee drinkers!  There have been so many times where I have wanted a cup of ground coffee (not instant), but didn't bother because I didn't want to dirty the coffee maker just for one cup, and didn't want to bother with the paper filters, etc.  This pour-over filter lets you have that one cup of whatever coffee you have on hand, and you have total control over how weak or strong you want that coffee to be.  However, it will hold enough ground coffee for more than one cup.<br /><br />This filter is made of an ultra fine stainless steel mesh that you pour the coffee directly into, there is no need for a paper filter.  The way this works is after you heat your water, place this filter over a coffee cup.  This specific filter is especially nice because it has a wide base (3-5/8” or 9.2 cm diameter excluding the trim) and will fit over pretty much any drinking cup. Next, add your ground coffee into the filter.  For my taste, I found that 1 heaping teaspoon of coffee is perfect.  Then slowly pour your heated water directly into the filter over the coffee.  There are 4 holes at the bottom of the base that enable you to see how full your coffee cup is.  These holes also “catch” any coffee that has seeped through to the outside of the filter, this water will then flow through those holes right into your coffee cup.  Really nice!  And unlike pour-over paper filters, this does not take long to filter.<br /><br />A small cleaning brush was also provided with this filter, which is nice as the brush bristles are soft and won't damage the fine stainless mesh.  Another thing I like about this item is the little handle has a rubber grip to make so it is easier to pick up.  I notice after looking at some of the other models they do not have the rubber grip.<br />This is a really nice coffee dripper/filter, and certainly worth having if you want total control over your coffee strength, or just want that one cup of coffee and don't want to mess with a coffee maker.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!",

However, you stack the eggs with this one, so you save space. Not only that, you can easily reach the second and third rows because each level swivels up to give access to the one below. The only thing that could have worked better was the small slider at the bottom that tracks freshness. It got stuck very easily and wouldn't budge. However, we go through eggs pretty quickly, so I wouldn't bother keeping track anyways, so this product has no downsides for me. I will always have an egg storage container from now on.",

    "text": "My first shipment of this washer from Rovsun, was the machine, the lid was broken the front of the machine was bashed in. Upon contacting the company they at first refused to replace and wanted to give me a $25 credit. After many emails, I went through Amazon and finally the company replaced the machine. it's a nice little washer maybe for campers or maybe for a small apartment that doesn't have room for a large washing machine however, it does not drain your water out so that it will empty the machine. the hose on it is for like a regular washing machine with the little  bend in the top of it so that you can put it over like your sink to let it drain. However, it won't drain it!!! It will just sit in the bottom of the tub if you lay the hose down the water will then run out. So if you have a place where you can put it where you can lay it down like in a shower would work or on the ground if it's outside. As far as its washing goes, it does a pretty well job and it spins out the clothes as well. I just can't get it to pump out the water at the end of the wash, so it'll drain out the hose unless you lay it down flat. This is my first experience with one of these types of washers. I guess I'm kind of 50/50 in my feelings of having bought it. Like I said if you're out in a cabin or you're camping you have a camping trailer places like that this would be great and it would really be beneficial if you have a place to store it. Also I find that the filler hose which hooks to your machine does not hook to your faucet it's very small and will not connect. Therefore, I just use another means of filling the tub in order to bypass using that holes.",

Gasket in front gets moldy because the water builds up in the channels and there is no drain.  Even with wiping it out after every wash, leaving the door open to air out, running sanitize cycles and using powdered soap and no fabric softener (and running sanitize cycles with bleach or vinegar), I still get mold and then my clothes smell like mold.  Very high maintenance to prevent the mold and not really worth the time considering how expensive this is.<br /><br />In order to clean out the lint and buildup, you have to practically take the machine apart.  Mine is in a built in custom kitchen and it is a nightmare to do this.  All other part that might need a regular service are also similarly inaccessible so , in addition to the high cost of purchase, there is a very high cost of maintenance.<br /><br />I had combo HE front loaders in europe and never had to do more than a moment's maintenance and never had issues.  This one is more trouble  than it is worth.<br /><br />Drying time is LONG.  Like for lightweight summer sundresses and underwear and not even a full load 1.5-2 hrs long.  When I can hang my clothes outside I  can just about bear this thing, but when I can't, I curse it's existence with all my heart.<br /><br />It came with the house I bought, but I would never buy anything like this again.

Then finally we checked the Timer dial. It indicated that it had failed. Its a VERY simple install.. In fact my Wife did it for fun. She wants to learn how to fix all the things around the house as I will not be here down the road. That's a long story, but simply put, I started tobacco use at 13 years old and never quit. I am 43 now and the damage is done.. Moving along.. My Wife enjoy's tackling the different little projects around the house that most people pay technitions and repair techs a great deal of money to do. This entire repair cost us only the cost of the new part. I think it was 53 bucks here on Amazon with free Prime shipping. It took 2 days to get here and we had it installed an hour after it arrived. I have done 4 loads of laundry and the part works perfectly. The local appliance parts center wanted 109 dollars for it.

I wanted a good, solid washer that I could depend on. This isn't it.<br /><br />This washer has a mind of its own. It will fill with water, refuse to begin agitating, and then randomly empty itself dry. This isn't due to user error. The machine is poorly designed. I've had the machine  empty randomly immediately after filling it on multiple occasions under entirely different scenarios. It's infuriating and wastes tons of time and water. Infuriating. Especially when you're in a rush or have multiple loads to wash.<br /><br />If this temperamental washer does make it through the cycle, expect to find your clothes wrapped and twisted around the agitator in some sort of hellish Gordian knot. Maybe not with every cycle, but often enough to be maddening. Horrible design.<br /><br />Looking forward to the day I can be rid of this thing. I'll never buy another GE washer.",

If that matters to you, carefully check the orientation of the flats on your range. The measurement of the ID is actually a little less than 8mm, and so the knobs did not fit our range. Was able to make them work by sanding the range's shafts down a bit. Other than that, these are nicely made, all of metal, and nice to look at along with the more facilitative shape. Our old knobs were all round and of plastic, these are far, far better. I'd buy again, even with the fit issues",

This little gem will cut down on those dreaded trips to the laundromat as long as the motor holds out.<br /><br />For those complaining that it doesn't spin, you have to empty the bucket to rinse, etc., etc.....c'mon people, this is a cheap, portable washer that does exactly what it says it does.

That metal assembly is no longer available (machine is only 4 years old). I cleaned the shaft after disassembly with a wire wheel. I then coated the inside of this plastic gear with candle wax. After assembling the machine to the point of needing this gear I mixed up JB Weld fast set and spread it onto the metal shaft thoroughly pressing it into the pores. Then I slid this gear onto the shaft. The wax concept is to prevent the epoxy from binding to the gear should I need to make a future repair. Otherwise good luck getting it apart. Washing machines are too expensive to replace. You're paying a lot for old tech. The machines just look fancier and have more computer controls.. controls that rely on more sensors... sensors that essentially still rely on the same basic drive motor and gear assembly.",

I wasn't about to just trash a $1000 appliance after a couple years.  I found the video showing this simple fix, which led us here.  Post repair, I left the front plate off for a few days just to be sure the leak did not return.  All good for just a few dollars and some light effort.

    "text": "This was a life saver for me.  After our washer stopped working and then our dryer, again, I was just so done.  I decided I needed a backup as going to the laundromat is a huge problem for me time wise.  My schedule is just way too hectic for that.  So after trying hand washing alone and messing up my hands in the process (hello joint pain), I needed another option.  This little gem did just that for me.  No, you cannot wash a lot of stuff in here.  I usually am able to fit in about 3-5 shirts, 2 pants (depending on the type).  I can even fit sheets in there, at least 2-3 twin size and 3-4 pillowcase covers, no blankets obviously.  Nevertheless, it seriously does the job.  My clothes do come out much cleaner and I also noticed that when washing my clothes in this little bit of practical magic that my skin did not itch as opposed to when we use a traditional washer.  Furthermore, the little spinner also does a pretty good job in that when I hang my clothes up to air dry they are done usually within an hour or two.  However, I do not do a lot of loads in one day as I do wring out any excess water before adding to the spinner and that can further take a toll on my hands so I just wash at best 2-3 loads a day with this.  Now I no longer keep a hamper in my bathroom I just put my things in there until I have enough for a load.<br />I have set up a little laundry station in my bathroom.  This little baby does not take up much space.  I place it in the bathtub when using and add water directly from the faucet from the tub by simply tilting it directly underneath.  When the load is done I switch to drain and lift one side, let the hose hang down to drain the water and repeat until the water is out (usually takes me 2 times to completely drain).  I know this sounds more cumbersome but its not a strain for me.  When I'm done using I put it back in its place after its been thoroughly drained.  FYI:  I tend to let it sit in the tub for a little while after basically manually draining to make sure all of the water is out to prevent leaks which have not happened.  It's not really heavy at all at 20lbs when empty and close to 50lb+ when fully loaded.  But, I like it and I no longer have to worry if my machines conk out again.<br />As for the company, the product came in good time with excellent packaging.  Really pleased with this purchase.  I only wish I had been aware that these things existed years before.<br />Thank you for reading and thank you to the company!!!!!",

Finally as seen In the photo its suppose to stop making ice when the basket is full, but it just keeps making ice until it runs outta water. Either way, we are just happy to have ice all the time.

You don't even need to turn off the water since the water flow is controlled by an electronic valve.  Snap in new ice maker, plug in connector and re-install panel cover.

The Hat Washer will take up some space on the top rack in the dish washer, but the results are worth it.
