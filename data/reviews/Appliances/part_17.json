I found these reusable coffee filters ideal for my Kuerig 1.0 dispenser. I can use my own coffee and use the reusable filters achieving an economical and tasteful cup of coffee. They fit well inside my Kuerig 1.0 dispenser. I enjoy brewing my choice of coffee at the price point I want to pay by simply scooping the amount of coffee I enjoy into the filter, inserting it into the machine and select the button that will dispense the desired amount into my trusty mug. After brewing, toss the coffee grounds into the trash, rinse the filter under the tap, and let it dry out or place it back into the dispenser to be ready for the next cup of freshly brewed coffee! I may save the local trash dump a few thousand less of the plastic throwaway dispensers that are used once and then tossed. Highly recommended!",

The slats seems to mostly protect the area between the stove and the counter (a slight gap at the back where it doesn't lay quite flatly on one of the sides--not sure why the sides fit differently--might be my stove or counters). From the bottom of the T that goes between stove and counter-top, the cover slat is slightly shorter on one side--that keeps it away from the burner while covering the counter amply. At first, I thought I might like it to be a little wider, but have decided that it's probably just right as is. (see photos)",

    "text": "HARD ON CLOTHES<br />After 4 months, I'm very disappointed in this machine. It tears clothes even when I follow the instructions given for use of the machine. I bought it because a review comparing machines stated that this one was easiest on clothes of all the well-reviewed \"High Efficiency\" machines. It's not easy on clothes.<br /><br />NOT EFFICIENT<br />This machine boasts a larger tub than the old fashion machines. However, you are only supposed to fill it 2/3 full in order to avoid tearing washed items (It didn't help to do that, for my towels). I also boasts water efficiency. However, only the normal cycle uses less water, and it doesn't efficiently clean the clothes or rinse the soap out thoroughly.<br /><br />You have to leave the lid open all of the time in order to prevent that High Efficiency machine bad odor (from mold) or you have to purchase products to clean out that smell wasting a full load of water (You're not supposed to use the \"Normal\" cycle because the water is too low to clean the smell completely out). It's inconvenient to have it open all of the time in a laundry room without much counter space.<br /><br />WASTING WATER<br />There is no way to tell the machine to only spin and drain. At some point, the machine will have an uneven load (or many) because of the way it works. So far, I haven't been successful at getting the machine to let me re-distribute the clothes--that is, to recognize that I have re-distributed the clothes--and then resume to spin then drain (an effort that is easy in the older machines; the older machines allowed re-distribution and allowed you to move the indicator to \"spin\", which also drained the rinse water.)<br /><br />There is a \"rinse, spin and drain\" cycle, but it sometimes (or always, in my experience) keeps adding rinse water in an attempt to redistribute clothes. The machine doesn't recognize that I have manually re-distributed the clothes, so it keeps adding water. It's very frustrating and very wasteful.<br /><br />Update:<br />I have discovered that the machine will sometimes finish a cycle after my redistribution of clothes, if I quickly push and release the power button, then push start. If you hold it down too long, it stops and you have to use the \"rinse, spin and drain\". It still may add more water, presumably in an attempt to redistribute clothes.",

I have the white Melitta ones, but there's something about the unbleached brown ones that seem more attractive. I chose this because one of the reviewers said that this filter is thicker than most. Wrong. They are not. Don't fall for that. It's the same thickness as the Melitta ones. They are thin. And it's about the same size as Melitta and so don't fall for those who say they are larger than most -- they are the same size as Melitta ones.<br />One thing I did notice. They are not as porous as the Melitta ones. In other words, when the coffee brewing was done, I noticed that it required more time for all the water to drain down. I don't know if that's a plus or minus. I figure that means the coffee will come out a little bit more bitter.<br />Also, as the photos show, it comes in one pack (I wish it was divided into two or five parts), and so it will be a task to store them for use.

I am trying to go for a cheaper alternative once more.<br />This filter is as described by the many people on this review -- 1) the taste of the water is good. No complaints with that, and 2) the water pressure is perfect -- not too strong so that water spills out of the cup, but not so weak that I have to wait a long time to fill the glass.

Iv'e tried everything from resetting it to changing cycles to dancing the &#34;please start you crazy piece of crap&#34; dance and nothing works. Then my husband will walk in as i sit on the floor in tears of frustration and press the start button and it will start!

    "text": "We bought this after our last washer of 20 years broke down on us.<br />I did a lot of research on washing machines because I did not want to spend all this money on something that I would end up hating or having to replace any time soon. It's odd that this particular machine gets bad reviews on Amazon. This washer is nearly 5 stars everywhere else I look with hundreds of reviews.<br /><br />This washer does take longer to wash my clothes than my 20 year old machine did. I guess I expected that, as I am using approx. 10 gallons in lieu of the 50-60 gallons I used to use. That's considerable! I went from a 40 minute wash cycle to almost an hour. That's not a deal breaker for me, as there is a short cycle if I was in a hurry for my clothes. Besides, they clothes get spun so dry in the spin cycle that they're barely damp when they come out of the wash saving a SIGNIFICANT amount of drying time. From wash to dry, I spend less time with this than I did with the older top loader, even though the wash cycles are a bit longer.<br /><br />This machine does a fantastic job of washing clothes. My clothes that used to come out dingy come out remarkably clean now. And like I previously mentioned, they get spun so dry the dryer barely takes any time at all. You only need about 2 TB of soap with the washer too, so you will save a lot of money on detergent.<br /><br />This washer comes with a pull-out dispenser for your soap (powder or liquid), liquid fabric softener and bleach. It's so convenient. I also really like and really use all of the different settings. I like that if I have a load of towels, I can set it to towels and not have to think about anything else. The washer also automatically senses how big your load is, so no more guessing as to whether it's a small or medium load.<br /><br />I love how my clothes, and especially my towels and sheets don't come out all twisted up anymore. I used to hate untwisting my sheets before putting them in the dryer. And kiss wrinkles goodbye. Unless you pack this washer completely full (which would be VERY difficult as it holds a LOT of clothes), your clothes have ample room to move which decreases wrinkles.<br /><br />I love this washing machine and would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new washing machine.",

    "text": "We have owned this for about 2 years. It has worked well, considering the price compared to higher models. The vent seems strong enough. I do have some specific cons...<br /><br />#1 it's very loud. I didn't think this would bother me so I opted out of a more expensive model. Our kitchen and family room are open to each other and when the fan is running, it's distracting to anything else going on.  I can't hear over the sound of the fan if I am cooking at the stove.<br /><br />#2 It gets really nasty greasy really quickly. It's not just the filter, but the whole underside. I'm not sure how often to expect disassembling and cleaning, but this seems to gunk up very quickly. Before too long, the grease will drip from the light and fan buttons. I have a 4 burner gas stove, to let you know the amount of cooking we do. I clean the filter regularly, but it gunks up quicker each time because I can't ever remove all the grease. I have been looking for some replacement filters but haven't found any yet. I wish the filters were thicker, because there is grease all over the internal parts of the fan as well, grease that has slipped through the filter. I wonder how long before this causes motor problems??<br /><br />#3 Button Settings - there are different speeds, and my button seems to only prefer the highest fan speed. Sometimes it doesn't turn on until I crank it all the way up. I think the buttons themselves feel a little cheap.<br /><br />#4 Light is so-so. If a lot of light is important to you, I'd go with another model. This gives off light, but not enough to consider it task-lighting.<br /><br />Again, decent option for the price.  Be prepared to clean very regularly. This is my first ducted hood vent so I'm not sure what is reasonable to expect.",

The best way to use it, is to put your filter in the freezer after drenching it with water, let it freeze and then put in the unit.  After that, when you are ready to use, put ice in the water tray with the water (make sure not to over fill it).  You can use it with or without the lights,  (makes a great little night light as well).  Also, you can make it spritz the water or use it without the water spritz.  I found this out by accident, so that was a nice bonus.  It doesn't get you wet, just cools the air better.  I am very pleased with this unit, so much I may purchase another for my guestroom.",

Put it on a table outside, so I could grab the gray water in a bucket and water the plants.  I put in water, soap (which I measured according to their instructions), a little baking soda because of our hard water, and a 2 lb load of light pajamas and undies.  Spun it at the right speed -- and heard flop, flop, flop, instead of splash, splash, splash.  The lump of wet clothes doesn't mix at all, it just flops from one side to the other in a clump.<br /><br />Ok.  Maybe that's ok.  Released the lid, swished with my hand for a minute, then put in the drain pipe.  Water spilled onto the table.  Glad it had a plastic cloth on it.  Drained into the bucket.  Refilled, added some vinegar, did the whole thing again to rinse.  Rinsed a second time.  Still bubbly water.  Stood there with the hose running into the pot while it drained at the same time, swishing with my hand.  Finally ran clear.  Took the pieces one at a time and ran them through my salad spinner to get rid of a lot of the water, then hung to dry.<br /><br />The clothes look clean, except for one major problem.  We have lots of animals, which means lots of fur.  Fur gets removed in the regular washer and dryer.  It does not get removed with this.<br /><br />I may try making \"washer rings\" out of some of plastic needlepoint canvas, and see if tossing some of those in to break up the lump of laundry will help.  Or try using dryer balls.  Otherwise, I think this will go back and I'll get one of the plunger types and a 5 gallon bucket. Or forget the whole thing and go back to the regular washer.",

The only improvement I would recommend would be for the manufacturer to increase the diameter of the stabilizing disk that sits on the the edge of the thermos or carafe...for the sake of versatility.<br /><br />I purchased this cone for use with a large, insulated carafe that has a wide opening.  The flat \"disk\" that is designed to hold the cone on the top edge of the thermos or carafe is narrow.  It works well for a narrow-mouthed thermos, but not too well for wider openings.  I solved this little problem by cutting a hole in the center of a cottage cheese lid, and then sliding the lid onto the cylinder end of the filter.  Works beautifully!  The cone sits on the top rim of my carafe, as it should.  (FYI: The carafe I bought:  SDREAM 68 0z Coffee Carafe Stainless Steel Insulated)",

Be aware of how the little tabs in front and back fit in the groves.  Also if stacking so you can slide them out -  On the bottom put the open part to the back, reverse for the top.  This will allow you to pull out the top easy peasy.  Now as long as the little front and back tabs do not break This is excellent.  I do not put this in the dishwasher.  Why would I?  If an egg breaks I will just wipe it out.  Side note I have seen how some have said on some models of this type it is difficult to pull out the eggs.  Not so with this model.

I filled about 1.5 gallons through the new filter until the water ran clear.  Then I filled a clean glass with water and was happy to see it was clear and tasted clean.  This is the first time I have used non-OEM filters, but after research I opted on this brand as a less expensive option.

I ordered two sets of these filter baskets so that there would always be one ready for use.  These filters work very well, are sturdy and well made.  Due to the pressure inside the K-kup cartridge during brewing, the coffee is tightly packed inside the filter after your coffee brewing is complete.  It takes a bit of rinsing and wiping to clear the basket of grounds, but it is well worth it to enjoy Keurig brewing perfection at just a few cents per cup.  I have no doubt these baskets will last several years, which makes them a fantastic bargain.",

    "text": "After getting the Wonder Wash from The Laundry Alternative and dragging the wet clothes from my sink to my large front-loader to only spin the water out, I decided to try this small spin dryer to remove the excess water instead of using the big machine.  My first one did not work properly so I informed the Laundry Alternative and they sent me a new one.  This little machine is awesome!  It's true that it doesn't hold a huge amount of clothes (1 pair of jeans or a couple of shirts), but the benefits far outweigh that one shortcoming.  Since I try to use the WonderWash daily, I don't have a huge amount to put into this dryer anyways.  Several have explained how to use it so I won't repeat that, but I do have a couple of things I've noticed about the cost of using this dryer.<br /><br />This machine is very lightweight and easy for me to lift to the counter to use.  I recently had back surgery so the weight of it was very important to me.  But my main reason for the purchase came down to the cost to use.  It takes 12 minutes to drain and spin clothes in my front loader, which spins at between 800-1000 rpm and also uses 1000 watts of electricity (yikes!).  This spin dryer goes 1600 rpm and uses only 83 watts of electricity.  I'm finding that enough water comes out during only 1 minute of spinning time for me to be happy with the results.  I do sometimes use 1 1/2 to 2 minutes for jeans, but so little extra water comes out during that extra time that it's not always necessary to run it that long.  I then hang things for the day to finish drying.  So it would take a very long time to use up the same amount of electricity that a front loader uses, even if you only use it (a regular washing machine) for the drain/spin cycle.<br /><br />By using this spin dryer in combination with the WonderWash for most of my laundry, my electric bill dropped $10 per week.  I phrased it by the week since I had only used this combination for a couple of weeks during the last electric billing cycle, so I'm expecting for the total electric bill to be reduced by around $40 next month.  So even when purchased along with the WonderWash, the combination will pay for itself very quickly.<br /><br />I'm very happy I made this purchase.  :-)<br /><br />This product was a personal purchase for myself at the normal retail price. I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers. I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.",

    "text": "I ordered this directly from the Laundry Alternative and I'm very happy with the purchase.  My biggest reason for purchasing it is the high electric rates we pay here in NH.  I've tried washing a variety of items in the WonderWash and have come to a &#34;compromise&#34; method.  Since they are heavy when wet and are bulky anyways, I still wash jeans and towels in the regular washing machine but everything else gets washed in the WonderWash.  I'll do a few loads (enough to equal what can go in the big washer), and then instead of wringing everything by hand, I'll squeeze out some water and put the items into a trash bag lined clothes basket and then pop all the items into the regular washer just for a drain and spin cycle.  Since my big washer is a front loader, this gets out most of the extra water while only using the machine for about 10 minutes.  For me, this method works great.<br /><br />Update:  Since reviewing this machine, I have purchased the Mini Countertop Spin Dryer from the Laundry Alternative.  I also have written a review on that dryer giving it a high rating also.  I do now wash jeans in the WonderWash, but towels still get put in the large washing machine.  This combination is saving me $40 per month over using my big washing machine and occasional use of my large full-sized dryer.  I also plan to take this on vacation this summer since I think I'd be lost without it now.  :-)<br /><br />This product was a personal purchase for myself at the normal retail price.

    "text": "First off it does not spin dry.  If it hadn't said that it might have gotten more stars.  Because for what it is it is a pretty decent machine.  When you don't have your own washer and have to wash some items quicker than you can go somewhere else to get them washed it washes pretty good and easier than hand washing, especially if you have more than one or two items.  These reasons might be stains or you need them sooner and have no time to go and they will air dry by the time you need them.  This works perfectly for delicate items you don't want washed with other items.  I have 3 shirts that have crocheted fronts or backs that I don't trust to my regular machine and I don't want them washed with other items.  To wash 3 shirts in a regular machine wastes a lot of energy.  They don't typically get very dirty so I can wash them in here for 6 minutes, rinse for 6 minutes then lightly squeeze out the water and let them air dry.  This machine is perfect for that. I just set it up on my kitchen counter, for now, add water clothes soap and go.  It isn't super loud but not super quiet.  I could watch TV with it being about 15 feet away just fine.  It doesn't move around a bunch so I had no worry it would fall off the counter.  One thing though I don't know where the markings they talk about for s,m.l are inside the thing. I have looked around and don't know if I am too blind to see it or it doesn't exist or I am looking in the wrong place.  But if you are looking for a small washer to wash a few items at a time this is a nice choice.  I had 2 tank tops and 2 regular shirts and there was easily room for more.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",

Not really too big but wasn't sure what to expect really.  So for me I sat this up on my kitchen counter threw in all the rags and towels that had been being stashed by my husband under the kitchen sink for who knows how long, put in some laundry soap and added water. For me my faucet didn't fit the hose it comes with because it has the sprayer head on it and comes out away from the sink so I just filled it from the main hole, which turned out fine and was probably quicker.  You plug it in turn the timer and it starts out.  You do need to remember that the clothes are washng against themselves and with the water.  There aren't 'beater bars' that help it along.  But that being said these washrags were highly in need of a washing and they smelled good after wards.  You wash, then you drain the water then you add water and rinse and you can rinse again if needed.  After you drain they are still damp so you need to squeeze out the extra water.  I think this would be perfect for delicates also along with your regular machine.  I bought this for my son who lives in a place without a washer and I also think this would be perfect for those with babies and no washer as sometimes their things need washed right then to avoid stains but you don't have a full load.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",

    "text": "This is an AWESOME filter. I cant tell you how many kinds of filters like this I have purchased over the years, but this one is, by far, THE BEST. The grounds stay in the filter, as does all the sediment that usually finds its way through these kinds of filters.<br /><br />I purchased this to use in my new Chemex glass pour over carafe.  It is a PERFECT fit. The orange ring around the top is actually silicone, so it prevents slipping and scratching on the glass carafe. It also enables you to lift it off the carafe without getting burned.<br /><br />Initially, I purchased a reusable filter  &#34;sock&#34;. But Because it's a tad awkward to clean wet grounds out of I got this Metal cone thinking I would put it inside the filter,  Best of both worlds, right? The metal cone easy to clean the sock to grab sediments the cone doesnt catch. But after using it several times and catching nothing but a stain, I stopped usinf the sock. This truly is one that needs NO OTHER filter. There is no sediment in the bottom of the carafe, or my cup.<br /><br />I have also used it with loose tea and still nothing got through.<br /><br />This one is on a class by itself. I love this one!",

I bought it several times and once it also lasted only 2 months, but, at least, it was for much cheaper price. I guess, our NYC water pipes are so contaminated that they soil filters so soon.<br /><br />Overall, I do not see the reason to overpay for other filters since this one works perfectly (water does not smell chlorine, tastes good and looks clean).

I'd think twice about this machine. There are definitely reviews similar to this and I ignored them.

Of course when you have a chemex you need these filters. I haven't been able to find them for sale anywhere around town so I was really happy to see that Amazon sells them. Although the price is pretty high considering it is just coffee filters, it is a reasonable price for the special chemex ones. My husband only uses his chemex when we are home from work on holidays or on weekends, so a box of filters probably lasts us about a year, which is nice, and makes the price tag a little easier to swallow. I think my husband actually prefers the white square filters instead of the brown square ones (he says the flavor of the coffee is different with the brown ones, but I don't notice anything), but when we last ordered them the price was higher on the white ones so we decided to go with brown. They work just like they are supposed to, so we are satisfied with them.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this, but I couldn't. There must be a VERY specific level of medium grind to use in this. I tried it twice, then returned them (I bought the twin pack to split the cost with a co-worker). The first attempt was filled about 3/4 full per the instructions. The brand new Keurig dribbled out about half of the 10 oz. that was selected. The 2nd time around, I filled it no more than 1/2 way, with essentially the same results, maybe got 6 oz. this time.<br />The holes in the bottom are not enough, it must also have holes in the sides. Unfortunately, the way this is manufactured, it would require a fairly complex secondary process after the initial stamping to accomplish this. Sadly though, there is enough fat in the price of these that proper design/development/manufacturing could have been done. If these had side holes, I have no doubt it would be a winner.<br /><br />This product is not junk, but it is completely useless as far as I'm concerned. This must be a very common issue, as the seller takes great pains (not only in the included instruction sheet, but in a follow-up email after I placed the order) in explaining exactly what grind to use: medium ONLY. I buy whole-bean coffee and grind it in a nutri-bullet with a grinder blade, so I don't have great selectivity of grind, but it's anywhere from fine to medium-fine. It works perfect for my drip maker, as well as my typical refillable plastic K-cup (which I will gladly go back to using).<br /><br />ONE star because of the following:<br />OVERPRICED: Like a piece of medical equipment. There is nothing high-tech nor extraordinary about the manufacturing of this that merits the price. Thin-gage stainless steel is great, but it's not that expensive or difficult to stamp. It may be worth the price if it actually worked.<br />UNDERDEVELOPED: Released for sale with known defect.<br />FIT: The lid is very slightly too large diameter, and doesn't close down properly. After use, the lid IS seated down, but so tightly that it requires unreasonable force to open it.<br />DESCRIPTION: Stainless Steel? Check! Aluminum? Got it! 24k Gold? Yep. It's all in the description.",

    "text": "An update.  After one year of use my True Beer Dispenser died.  Now runs continuously, will not cool below 48 F.  Again, no warranty coverage is provided by True although I paid $1,200+ for it.  So this has been a bad purchase experience.  I am going to write it off / not pay to get it fixed again.  My lesson learned for those interested in a True Beer Dispenser - save your money.  Buy a refrigerator (you can buy a new one for less than $600 / much less for a used one), take out the shelves and convert it to a Kegorator.  Not only will you have room for two 1/6 kegs + CO2 tank, you will also have additional room for a refrigerator shelf to store stuff, plus in door storage plus a top freezer to chill your glasses.  You will also have a more reliable, quieter running  product with a warranty and you will save $600+ dollars to stock it.  That is what I did!! So learn from my experience.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I posted the following  review 2 months ago.  Well, I retract everything below - I was \"so\" wrong about TRUE's warranty service.  I just received a bill for my warranty service with just one sentence from TRUE:  \"WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL APPLICATION\".  Now I am being asked to pay $284.36 to repair a defective product.  Of course, I was told this AFTER the cooler had been repaired.<br /><br />If I had known I would be paying $1200+ for product WITHOUT a warranty - and then paying $284+ to repair it - I never would never have purchased it.<br /><br />I purposefully paid a premium price to purchase a \"made in USA\" product - so much for my good intent.<br /><br />There is much better value for your money with other manufacturers who do stand behind their product and provide a warranty.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I have only had this cooler for approx. 2 months.  I researched extensively before purchasing (just ask the bartenders) and this was their recommendation for a 20+ year quality trouble free product.<br /><br />So far I am impressed with both True product quality and True customer service.  After setup, the cooler did not keep temperatures as cool as I would prefer.  True warranty service was extremely prompt in sending out someone to look at it and improve the thermostat setup for a lower temperature.  What has impressed me the most is how quickly I am connected with an experienced True customer service rep when I call and how friendly and helpful True customer service has been.<br /><br />It was a premium price purchase for a premium / commercial quality product.  I am glad I spent the extra $$$ for a US product.",

Being high quality Stainless Steel makes it safe for food, even hot food use. ( Not for cooking in ) I made sure this was the correct height for under the spout, and I use it now to pour the water in the back of the pot, it works a lot better than using the pot because there is no lid getting in the way. The pour spout shape is perfect for that and in a few months if it gets scratched, I will add to this review and say so. I am sure I will find all kinds of uses for it as time goes by, because it is so pretty, for one thing, it is a good choice for using on a nicely set table.

The price of this product is amazing for the quality.<br /><br />We needed a frothing pitcher for our espresso machine & we needed a small pitcher for our Mini Keurig. I am showing pictures of my red Keurig and this 12oz pitcher is used to catch the coffee. The mugs we use for coffee are typically too large to use with our Mini Keurig, except the small mugs that came with our set of dishes. My son has a 20oz travel mug & my other son and I like to use our 16oz reusable Starbucks mugs with lids. We had been using our 8oz Pyrex measuring cup to catch the coffee, but I hate the way it dribbles liquid when you pour. We tried a few other things but they didn't fit or didn't pour without dribbles.<br /><br />I searched the reviews for all the 12oz frothing pitchers, and I want to say &#34;Thank You&#34; to everyone that reviews honestly, it really helps me to make an informed decision. This really sounded like the one I needed and was the only one that was mentioned for pouring without dribbling.<br /><br />The frothing pitcher was delivered in a small Utopia box. When I opened the box it was in perfect condition, no rust or dings. I did notice the word Utopia was on the pitcher and a few people mentioned that in the reviews, but it is etched so lightly I can barely see it. I even took pictures of the side with the company logo so you could see how it is barely visible.<br /><br />Using this with our Mini Keurig is wonderful! It pours just as other reviewers stated, it does NOT dribble. It cleans up quick. It looks nice and shiny after several weeks of being used and washed several times a day. I will be purchasing more. I want one just dedicated to frothing milk, one to use as a creamer and a few just to have. Other reviewers mentioned using it to serve warm syrup or gravy.",

For my purposes, however, the cubes were wet, had to be quickly removed from the drawer, frozen flat and then packaged in another container. There is no was to store them, even for a short period of time, in the unit. They melt. If they were not separated and frozen flat on a cookie sheet they all stuck together and were useless for my purposes. In spite of pre-cleaning as directed by the manufacturer, the ice had an \"off taste.\" The unit is very large, make sure to consider this in your purchase. I will not use this as planned so it has been moved into storage for use in large parties I suppose after another series of cleaning and flushing to see if I could removed the off-taste.

    "title": "Still a PUR filter, removes more contaminants, and still tastes great.",
    "text": "There seem to be a lot of negative reviews that have strangely different complaints but one thing in common: They wanted a &#34;PUR&#34; filter. I wonder if this may be a purely psychological issue; those who expected a PUR filter were disappointed in what they received and looked for something wrong with it. The truth is that this is still a PUR filter. In fact, if you check out the picture of the item right here on the Amazon product page, you will see that on the right side of the box near the bottom is the PUR logo. If you &#34;need&#34; a PUR filter, this is it.<br /><br />I've had no problems with this filter at all after using it for about 4 weeks now. I will mention that I am careful to follow the instructions and flush enough water through the filter initially. If you haven't flushed enough water then any taste issues may be due to that, so perhaps try flushing more water through. The water from my filter tastes exactly the same as it did with the previous version of this filter. I drink several glasses every day and it tastes exactly the same. No one else in my household even noticed that we used a different filter than before. We had several visitors for 4th of July weekend and since we live in the scorching hot desert, we went through at least a few gallons of water through their stay and we actually got comments about how nice and clean it tastes.<br /><br />I will agree with those who complain that the price is getting outrageous. I am bothered that the price has gotten so high. Currently it is about $7 per month to use this filter, and I would definitely spend more than that buying bottled water. I'm not claiming that the price is great, just trying to be pragmatic about something that is as confusingly controversial as a water filter!<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this as an &#34;upgrade&#34; of the previous version since it removes a significantly higher number of contaminants compared to the last version. Seeing as how there's not an option to buy the previous version, the water still tastes great, and the price is still practical compared to the alternative, purchasing this is a good choice in my opinion.",

Believe me, you kind of need to know which order the bearings, sleeve and washer go in.<br /><br />Luckly, I found a video on youtube - search for: Whirlpool Cabrio Kenmore Oasis Bearing Repair Part 1.  This is exactly what I needed to get the job done.<br /><br />It took me, for my first time ever doing this, about 2 hours to do this job.  I didn't use the suggested bearing press (because I didn't have it), but I used the old bearing and put it on top of the new bearing and I only tapped on the outter race of the old bearing until it seated in place.  I will know in a month or two if I should have used a bearing press to pull these in because I'll be replacing these bearings again.  Next time, it should only take me about an hour to do.<br /><br />FYI, if you go to your local hardware store and get a piece of all-tread, a couple of washers and nuts, it'll do the same thing for you.",

I played with a few different grain sizes and loosely packed versus heavily packed and even tried to cut a small hole in the lid for that (does not keep insert lid clean) and in all cases coffee is by far weaker strength that if I rip of the lid.<br /><br />Still it was worth trying I guess and for the price its not a total rip-off since I can just rip off the lid and get stronger coffee.

At home I always use the water through my samsung refrigerator which has these filters in since march 2020... so it was time to replace the filter.  I wanted to recreate the water scenario and bought a 3rd party zero filter which came with a ppm measurement device.  Tap was 266-272 over multiple measurements.  Old filter was also in this range which I thought ok its 6mo old and replaced.  I put in the new and got about the same.  So I took the filter out of the fridge just to make the fridge have no filter and got the same.  fyi the sensor measured 0 with the zero filter but ok not apples to apples I get that- just trying to understand the impact to installing these filters at all.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I looked at the spec sheet and it says about 0.5ga/min so I tested that with old filter, no filter, and new filter and had no discernible difference using a stop watch best if my ability marking the position on my carafe (don't  tell my wife).<br /><br />So now I wonder -<br />1. should these filters affect flow rate and if not then why not?<br />2. should these filters affect ppm detection rate and if not why not?<br /><br />In terms of my sensitivity taste the water does taste better through the fridge than from tap but it could be temperature or plumbing so I try only to compare with and without filter but do not discern taste differently.",

I have no other place to put it, or I would move it out of our bedroom, which was the whole reason I bought it in the first place.<br /><br />Other than the noise, the fridge works great, has a lot of room, and doesn't build up any ice in the freezer compartment.

The Utube video showed essentially taking the whole dryer apart, including removing the drum.  Obviously, the Sears Kenmore repair service depends on consumers giving up and calling it in for part replacement service.

The filter normally last up to six (6) months after amazingly easy installation, This Filter goes to work immediately reducing the chlorine, dirt, sediment, rust and turbidity that impact the Flavor and quality of the Drinking water you serve in your home.  Better yet, this Filter is priced to ensure you never pay more than you should for clean water.  This is perfect because our water is real bad and we will not drink the ice or water from the refrigerator without a good working filter.  This is how we know when the filter is not working.  After installing the new replacement filter we noticed the difference in the taste of the water and the ice.  They taste like bottled water!  This Filter by Replacement Brand works just as good as the Original Filter but to a way better price.

    "text": "I love this french press!  It  it makes a great pot of coffee. And the coffee really does stay hot for quite a while.  The press component is easy to clean and comes clean with little effort.  I like the inside etching that marks off cups in ounces, making it easier to know just how much fluid you have in the container.  Just right size for easy portability.  It would be perfect it the lid could be screwed down because even though the lid has a twist style top that allows you to block flow of liquid out of the press, it doesn't full occlude the opening, even with lid pressed down as snug as possible.  It is too early to know if the red coating will hold up or if it will come off but right now is it a true to ad color that I really like!  I also like the added coffee &#34;spoon&#34; measure that has a sturdy clip attached so I just snap it on the coffee bag and don't have to search for it in the drawer.",

    "title": "Fantastic ice machine that makes unlimited chewable ice nuggets and FAST!",
    "text": "[[VIDEOID:ba4541635d2545c9271a4d2adf78c0f9]] I love chewable Ice nuggets!  I will go to a certain restaurant just because they have that kind of ice, but now I don't have to.<br /><br />This ice machine is wonderful.  I see complaints in some other reviews about specific things, but those things are actually a benefit to me.  I love that I can hook this machine up to a constant water source, or not!  The choice makes all the difference about where you place the machine and if you will need a plumber to come hook up the line if you don't have a handy person to do it for you.  In our case it is going to be on a countertop off my main kitchen area that has water accessible but I prefer to just add water as needed myself.  I will not be running the machine all day.  We like to have a cool beverage at different times throughout the day but I am cool with turning it on only when I want ice.  For example, I turn it on in the morning to have my cool beverage to start my day.  Then again in the afternoon to have another cool beverage, then again at night after dinner I like to enjoy an iced coffee.  This machine makes ice so fast that it is not a problem to turn it on when I want a cool beverage.<br /><br />It literally starts dropping ice within minutes.  And there is enough for a tall iced coffee within 8 minutes. And two tall iced coffees within about 10-12 minutes.  It takes me that long to make the coffee so this is not bother.  If we have company and know we are going to need ice for cool beverages I can just turn the machine on and it will continue to make ice until it runs out of water in the reservoir.<br /><br />The ice drops into a tray that has drain holes in the bottom so if it melts some it goes down into the reservoir and is taken up again to make more ice.  The ice is a bit wet, that is the nature of this type of ice, so some water is going to be recirculated during the making process.  Because of the drain holes, your ice isn't sitting in water when you scoop it out into your glass.  I like to fill my glass completely full with the ice then add my beverage.  The small nuggets of ice cool your beverage down really fast.  Then once you are done drinking the beverage you can munch on the ice that is now filled with the flavor of your drink.  That is probably my favorite part.<br /><br />There is a drain tube on the back of the machine, you will remove the plug to drain the machine when you want to clean it out or if you just don't want to use the water that is in the reservoir, like if you are not going to be using the machine for a while.  There is a clean setting on the machine so you would run the clean cycle then drain the water to empty the machine.  You should also expect to run the clean cycle when you are first setting up the machine.  The instructions explain exactly how to do this.  They are actually very good instructions that include images to help you.<br /><br />Some folks complained that you can barely see the light around the setting button, but I didn't seem to have that problem.  It isn't really bright, but you can see when it is flashing white or yellow, or when it is running in a circle with different colors‚Ä¶the instruction book also explains what each of the different lighting flashes indicates.  The power switch is on the back of the machine, right at the top so you can easily use the switch without the need to turn the machine around once you know where it is.<br /><br />The tray that holds the ice is not cooled so if you leave the ice in it, it will eventually melt and pour back into the reservoir.  You could scoop out the ice and put it in your freezer but with the high moisture content of this type of water it will become a block of ice once frozen and you will have to use an ice pick to break it up.  It does not melt away immediately, so if you continue to make ice, it will keep itself pretty cool for some time, so no fear that you need to immediately scoop it out.<br /><br />I really like this machine and how fast it works.  I love the option of hooking it up to a water source or just pouring in the amount of water needed to fill the reservoir.  I love the type of ice that it makes and that it will continue to make ice until it either runs out of water in the reservoir or I turn it off.  The only thing I don't care for is the scoop.  It has a really nice scoop on it, but the handle is too long.  It just fits inside the tray without much room to spare so if you are scooping near the bottom it may catch on the edge of the tray.  I am going to cut the long handle off and just use the scoop end.  So if the scoop is my only complaint I would say this is a pretty great machine.<br /><br />We are in the middle of remodeling our kitchen and we need to get a new refrigerator that is smaller than the one we currently have because it has to fit in a different area in the kitchen.  I have been unable to find a smaller fridge that still has ice in the door, so now I don't have to even worry about that because I will always have my favorite ice ready when I need it.  This will also allow the contents of the freezer section to stay cooler because I won't be opening the door to get more ice through the day.  The ice maker in our current fridge cannot make ice this quickly either but with this machine we will never run low because of heavy use when we have company.<br /><br />And one more bonus, this type of ice is perfect for making ice packs for sore muscles or injuries.",

    "text": "Great device.  I use several of these to monitor the temperature and humidity in my different rooms where I grow hydroponically.  I receive an alert on my phone if my high or low temps are reached and from there I can also remotely turn on or off my air conditioners or fans to adjust the temperature for each room, even when I am away running errands.<br /><br />Super easy to link the device with the app on my phone, and add to my apps when I add a new device to the room as well.  Very handy to monitor the temperature in my grow rooms at any time of day or night without having to go to each room to manually check the digital readout on the device.  I also have one in my bedroom where I like to monitor my humidity as I need it to remain above a minimum level and if it drops below that level my app helps to automatically turn on the humidifier without me needing to manually do that task.<br /><br />Super helpful device that makes my life better.",

    "text": "I wanted to use this to monitor the temperature in my critter room and link it with Alexa so she could turn on the air conditioner when the temp reached a certain level.  But unfortunately it will not do that because the switch to the air conditioner is not a Tuya device.  It is linked with Alexa as this T & H sensor is, but it is a different brand, so it wont do that.<br /><br />So the best I can do with it is to have it send me an alert when the temperatures reach a certain level, then I would then go in to Alexa and have her turn on the A/C unit.  Then when the temperature cools down to a certain temperature it will send me an alert and I can then go back in to Alexa and have her turn the A/C unit off.  Kind of a pain.  It says that you can ask Alexa what is the temperature in the room where the device is, but mine will only tell me the humidity not the temp and when I ask Alexa she says she cannot tell me‚Ä¶so give up.<br /><br />I will be getting a different device to accomplish what I wanted to do with this one and just use it to tell me the temp and humidity of the device location, but that is it.  I was going to return it but it is too much hassle to bother with at this price.<br /><br />I was pretty generous with my 3 stars considering it wont do what it implies it will do.  It really earns about a 2.5 star at best.",

It is made of stainless steel so it's incredibly durable and can be washed in the dishwasher without having to worry about rusting.<br />3.

It does a good job getting hot enough that you can tell when the milk is ready, some are too heat protective to where it's too hot and easily burned, this gets hot enough you know it's time but not hot enough you are going to burn yourself, it's rather perfect in my opinion.<br />-All things considered I would definitely purchase this item again.",

I haven't ran any tests, but the water tastes great and you get what you pay for. I like saving money as much as anyone else, but I don't mind spend more in this case.",

So I searched website after website and started with a price of $160 then I found them cheaper and cheaper and read review after review until I got to this part. For under $40 I got the whole unit brand new AND I got it delivered super fast from this seller. We installed it within an hour of receiving it and about an hour after that, WE HAD ICE!! Praise the Lord! Installation was super easy. We couldn't be happier! All I drink is ice water so I was suffering for a couple of days without it. I can't believe I saved so much money.

Amazon flagged my return request as a self return (I had to pay to ship), but the seller followed up (without any prompting or complaint from me) with an email instructing me to ignore that. They requested pictures of the issue and once they received them I was issued a paid return label. I probably would have tried to fix the leak myself if it were not for the cold water/ ice functionality, it really is a very good ice maker.<br /><br />This is an ice maker that will sometimes dispense cold water.

Before that, never had a problem with it. So, I ordered this new one, and I like it very much, though it does take just a little longer to produce a cup than my other Cuisinart did when it was new, but not a big deal. This one is basically the same as the previous one, but I like that it takes up a bit less space. I do think the coffee is a little less hot than my previous machine, but that doesn't bother me at all. Love that it puts out hot water as well. If it lasts four years like the other one did, I'll be happy...I think that's reasonable considering the two Keurig machines I had didn't even last a year.",
