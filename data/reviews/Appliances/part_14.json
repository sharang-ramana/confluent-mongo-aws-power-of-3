Now, the problem may have been filling too full. This rim 900 is the same as the rim 300 without the model specific parts. The instructions clearly warned about not adjusting the water level immediately. I left it as it came and it is working well although the cubes are a little small. Is doe snot seem to shut off reliably but that is not causing problems. Time will tell.<br /><br />You might ask why buy a 3-rd after 2 disappointments.

I use a bucket to catch the rince and spin water for the next wash.<br /><br />This is an update after several years of using this while camping with my RV. So many people are complaining of fitting the hose into sink faucets. If you watch the video the lady simply pushes the hose up onto the faucet but we RVers know about the \"water bandIt\". That works great to get water from any faucet. Put the hose into the bandit and push that onto your faucet. Mine is still working and spinning my clothes almost DRY, a few minutes on a wooden rack and they are good to go. One more hint adding an ounce of vinegar softens the clothes. I also use the miracle clothes balls instead of detergent so I can dump the water out on the ground. Amazing how much dirt these balls get out of the clothes. These balls are regenerated by placing in the sun for a few hours. I wash once a week when boondocking because I'm a nurse and refuse to use public laundry rooms. The other gadget I use is the clothes dryer that shoots hot air up around the clothes. I put it under the wooden rack or clothes hung on the shower rod when I am plugged in to electricity at an RV park. I don't need the plastic bag that comes with it to enclose the bag.",

All my handles are the same size as they are all Samsung and newer appliances. These are so cute, but when I got to the oven I realized the short ones were also smaller in diameter. Maybe I missed this in product description, but I'm bummed. I can sort of get them to barely hang on by a thread if your careful to open the oven. I bought this over others because of the handle amounts, so I wish it was perfect. I'll be trying to figure out something to add like an extra Velcro amount for next year, so I don't have to purchase another set. These held up great for just over a month of Christmas decor, aside from the oven ones constantly falling off. I ended up having to leave one off as it gave me too much grief.

I find that this new fridge cycles less and is quieter than the old fridge.

    "text": "Worst product I've EVER purchased in my life. I've replaced the main gasket 3 times. Cost out of pocket each time was 145-185 per gasket. Half for label and half for part. I follow LG and repairman's instructions to the T the last two gaskets and they continue to build up mold and algae along with terrible odor too. I've used EVERY tub cleaner and hot tub cleaner recommended and wiped out after EVERY use.<br /><br />And now I'm having another problem from time to time that can be diagnosed correctly. Overflow problem with drawer. And its not the same cycle. And when repairman runs thru tests its always empty and just test cycles. As soon as I start to do load after load...it occurs again and again. On different temperatures and different settings (Load size and temps etc.)<br /><br />I would not buy another or ever keep and use another LG Washer even if I WON IT and it was FREE.<br /><br />Customer Service was garbage from the start and repairmen seem to jerk people around knowing these problems and rack up $$$$$$.<br /><br />If I was really smart. After 2nd repair. I should have thrown it out and bought another brand and model<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THESE WASHERS ....TERRIBLE DESIGN...TERRIBLE RELIABILITY (WM2016CW 27 Front Load Washer)<br /><br />oh by the way...the Dryer has issues from time to time..too many loads in a row and belt starts to slip unit it starts to shake like a BANSHEE! Simple fix. Open door let humidity out a lil bit. Restart and seems to go away but this unit cannot handle the load after load as well<br /><br />DLG2526W",

Like another reviewer I think a different color would make it easier to see where the coffee is in the scoop,<br /><br />The device comes with a handles that is essentially a split tube and the two halves of the tube are arranged to encompass the working end of the device.  The two halves screw together and held in place by screws, one at each end of the tube.  Unfortunately the lack of quality control is apparent here. The screws are not tightened and the halves of the handle are not tight but are instead rather loosey  goosey.  Makes for a sloppy hold on the device. The screws are tiny Phillips head and the heads stripped when I tried to tighten them down. I think holes for the screws needed to be drilled a bit further deeper.<br /><br />Anyway.  It works fairly well. Don't have high expectations for its longevity,",

I have had this installed now for a few months and everything is holding up great as expected. I did notice some small leaking at connector early in the connecting process. I disconnected the hoses and clipped fresh cuts in the hose and then reconnected everything. This seemed to work. I just figured the factor cuts were not cut straight.

After it magically connected I carefully pushed my dryer to where I wanted it, double checked the connection and it was perfect. Installation wise I only  had 2 minor issues. One was the 4\" pipe  that came out of my wall was a fairly heavy guage so I had to use my dremel with cutting wheels to cut it flush to the wall and 2 because I'm a neatness freak I removed my baseboard trim to cut out a decent radius even though no one will probably ever see it. The actual installation of the MagVent was pretty easy. I always feel you get what you pay for so I have no complaints about the price. This thing probably will last a long time and out live a few dryers to boot. Now I can take my leaf blower a couple times a year and keep the dryer vent clear and clean. Great product.",

It's beyond me why local stores don't sell them. I came to believe the US did not sell them until 2 years ago when I accidentally stumbled across a website that indeed sold centrifuges. My new washer does not spin my clothes very 'dry' so this little gem spins the rest of the water until damp dry. It is perfect for small hand wash items, like bathing suits, bra's etc. But I also use it for bed sheets, no problem.<br />One improvement the Panda spinner could use: a rubberized 'gripper' in the lid. I have a bit of a job to open it because it is slick and nothing to grab onto. But a drop of water on my fingertips to moisten my skin will then 'grab' the lid to open it.  Still, I am happy as a lark with this centrifuge.",

It dries things so well that I can hang them to finish drying anywhere without dripping water on the floor. UPDATE: 12/05/2019  about 3 months of using it I noticed the spinner was very easy to become unbalanced and I would have to stay right there with it to stop and adjust the clothes several times before it would spin and then about a month ago I had to start tilting the machine to get it to speed up and just now the lil bowl like thing popped off the axis and with the F'd up screws they use you can't take it apart to put it back on.

Wolf is a very reputable and reliable company and took back  the range that I had for a few months and returned my money (a first class outfit).  So I purchased a new Viking range and am thrilled with some of the new features.  The self cleaning ones have been discontinued so this one is not self cleaning.  The shelves in the oven roll out and one burner has more BTUs  than the rest for big jobs.  Also the infrared oven is excellent and the top is now sealed so liquid does not drip down into the guts of the oven and rust it out like the old one.  The company is not as generous as Wolf and made me purchase a new set of knobs with the color of my choice (black) for better visibility and would not take back the silver ones as an exchange.  The only annoying feature of all the new ranges is that they turn off when the oven gets very hot, even when you are using the IR broiler.  I crack the door open to cool it to defeat this stupid feature.  The IR broiler can be used with the convection fan and this is excellent on the Viking but not allowed on the Wolf.",

Also some little gadgets in the control knobs to prevent ignitors from firing in error.  Karl Schaedel Co in PA helps you diagnose the problems and sells the repair part.  If I had to pay for repairs I would have thrown the whole thing out years ago.  I like the high BTU top burners and particularly the infrared oven that acts like the barbecue grill.  The infrared broiler has lasted nearly 20 years now and makes it possible to grill meat and fish during  the winter without going outside, although sometimes the flames inside the over get too exciting.  The weakness from the beginning has been the while enamel shell that I have sanded and repainted repeatedly and has I now gotten to the point of having to look for a new 30 inch wide gas range.  The Wolf infrared broiler's configuration seems to have mainly \"dead spots\" so I will  have to go with Viking again for the infrared broiler.  Apparently the new broilers can cycle on and off because of more conservative thermostat control but if you leave the door a little open, it will keep it cool enough to keep the broiler on.  Of course \"stainless steel\" can also rust depending upon the quality.\"",

    "title": "Fully restored my LG Steam dryer",
    "text": "[[VIDEOID:183e6f4b86bf51e723b3b8b53b9c63ba]] My wife and I love our LG Steam Dryer and Washer units.  Last week the dryer started making a really bad screeching sound and I knew immediately that the drum rollers were going out.  I ordered the Dryer Repair Kit and it came the very next day.  The hardest part of the repair was getting to the back of my dryer since our laundry room is more of an overgrown closet than an actual room.  At any rate I managed to get the 3 screws off the back of the dryer by reaching OVER the dryer while standing on a step stool.  Once the 3 screws come off, the top of the dryer slides off towards the rear.  The rest of the dryer comes apart in a fairly straightforward manner.  I took a lot of Pix with my Iphone just to make sure it went back together correctly.  Once the control panel came off and the door assembly was removed, it was easy to remove the rest of the front panel supports and the drum itself.  I was then able to rotate the remaining base of the dryer since it was much lighter, to get to the rear screws that hold on the mounting plate that holds the 2 rear drum wheels.  Removed all the wheels and replaced them with the wheels in the kit.  Next replaced the idler pulley, and the drum with the new belt.  Re-attached the control panel, front door etc.  Started the dryer and it now runs perfectly!  Saved a ton of money in the process.",

The floor is over the crawlspace; the floor being hardwood and tile with the washer and dryer on the tile. Prior to using these the vibration from washer and dryer was transferred to the floor which amplified the sound. The lower noise level change is AMAZING. The washer is a front end loader an spins up to wring the cloths rotating at a speed that looks like a jet engine spinning.<br />My only minor complaint is that the material contacting the floor could have been a little stickier because the washer did walk slightly in the beginning. It has seemed to find permanent location now.<br />The washer and dryer sit on bases. To install the rear isolators I removed the drawers. With a simple lever, made from a couple pieces of wood, I was easily able to raise each corner to slip the isolator in place. I was able to do it by myself with little effort.",

Figured that for the price, there was nothing to lose with this and it's PERFECT!  Has everything you need for whatever you come across after you tear down your dryer.  Parts appear to be identical to OEM and work well.  Saved me a TON of money and dryer down time by having everything on hand at the start of the repair and was less expensive than the service call fee just for having someone come out to look.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

The welds on the sides of the hood are breaking apart (tearing - see photos). This truly is poor craftsmanship. Customer service, well even worse. Not willing to negotiate because I was a couple of months past my 1 year warranty. SO...if you want a product from this company, don't expect them to help if you're past the warranty period, no exceptions. I do not recommend this product to anyone (even if my product was a one time issue, but because of the poor customer relations they provide).",

There is a huge downside to it, the noise, and it doesn't kill the product, just may need to compromise on the location. I initially thought it would be easy to use in the sink, but the noise creates pressure which bothers me and one of my cats. My boyfriend, dog and the other cat don't seem to notice it, seems to be a hit or miss. My solution was to use it outside, or in a room far enough away to not be heard.<br />The machine is simple to use, and I just plug it in and forget about it.<br />I also do want to mention that this usually ships out faster than the estimated time, I got mine over a month early.",

At first, the water seemed to dribble a little (where you put the cup to get the water on the door) but after we let it run for 5 minutes (per the directions), it worked perfectly. The water pressure is much better than the GE model (comes out much faster now) and it tastes great. I will definitely order this filter again in the future.",

The filter cup included to make your own coffee is twice as big as the filter cup with keurig. Therefore you can make stronger coffee if you want. This coffee maker allows you to make either 4 ounces, 6 ounces, 8 ounces, 10 ounces, or 12 ounces. Very nice feature! You can set the clock easily to display the time as well.

I had a difficult time reaching anyone to troubleshoot.  When I finally did,  I was advised to send in a video clip of its malfunction, (flashing red lights, and no heat), and the receipt.  I did this but NO RESPONSE for 2 weeks.  I asked my licensed electrician, who had done the completely new wiring to begin with, and to re-check everything.  He did, and concurred, the stove failed, while ALL wiring and the breaker remained intact. He contacted the company, was told the same thing, and that the \"website was down\" and to try it again. He tried, the website worked fine.  It is now another two or three weeks later.  We re-sent the video and the receipt a third time.  I DOUBT THEY WILL RESPOND THIS TIME.

I had visions of an unexpected visit to the appliance store for a new one.  But after some quick googling, I was able to determine the issue was this switch needing replaced and that the task of replacing it was a relatively simple one.  The switch arrived on Saturday thanks to the fast Amazon Prime shipping. Just needed a screwdriver and about 30 minutes and my washing machine was back in business.  It was an easy enough fix that I actually did it in a dress and heels.  My husband now thinks I'm superwomen as he stood and watched in awe as I got our washing machine working again. My machine is a Kenmore 110.23812100.  You can find videos on youtube to walk you through the process.",

This item in the meantime is great. Here's a summary of the best tips:<br />This is a small appliance, someone described it like a blender. It is Not a washer replacement, so change that perception or you'll be disappointed.<br />Fill it to the lowest line load. The second line makes no sense. Water will spill out, even on the gentle cycle.<br />Don't fill it up. Clothes need to be able to move with water around them. I might do an adult wool blend sweater and a couple pairs of socks, but not jeans and a sweater: too much material for the appliance to handle well.<br />Make sure the bucket sits properly on the motor and is against a wall or something. This will prevent the bucket spinning. The weight of clothes and water should provide support as well.<br />Use a tiny amount of detergent. I'm amazed at how clean and nice smelling the clothes are after washing in this thing. What have I been doing up to this point?<br />Run a rinse cycle when desired. Works great with liquid fabric softener.<br />Dump out water, squeeze clothes, hang up or throw 'em in a dryer.<br />I wipe the washer down underneath-to prevent rust I saw in some pictures-and unplug it if I'm not using it for a while.<br />So full marks and a high recommendation. It isn't as pretty as some of the other washers, but it does the job and that's why I bought it.",

Then, slide a flathead screwdriver (I actually used a butter knife, but a flat putty knife might work even better) under the veneer at the top left corner of the inside of the door and gently &#34;pry&#34; the liner out. It's difficult at the beginning, as there are plastic fasteners every few inches (hidden from view) that hold the door together. (As opposed to the small metal clips that are visible). When the first fastener &#34;popped&#34;, I feared I had damaged the door, but it was fine- I was then able to slide my butter knife down the door and pry the fasteners out until the inside lining came out. I was afraid to take the entire liner out, but it eventually fell out on its own as the fasteners are the only parts keeping it in place. I would actually suggest taking the liner completely out altogether, because once the handle screws are revealed, you will need a Phillips screwdriver to unscrew the handle screws. If the inside lining is still in place, I think most screwdrivers would be too long to fit in between the liner and the screw. Once the screws are out, I saved them and put the new handle on. It seems like it would be easy to torque too hard and crack the handle, so be careful! I was not able to get this part to be flush against the door- (there is probably a 1mm gap between the handle and the door, thus the 4 star rating- also, some instructions to replace would have been nice). Once the new handle is on, the lining snaps right back in easily. Screw in the three door screws and you're ready for more TV dinners... I was careful, but our microwave still sustained some minor damage and part of the door cracked because I screwed one of the door screws back in too hard... The whole process takes about 20-30 minutes...",

Following a brief, clear online video (on our specific oven model), this would have been a quick and simple job but some of the screws inside the oven were \"frozen\" tight. WD40 to the rescue! It took about an hour due to this delay, but also because we gave a thorough cleaning to the range and the area behind it.

The case is strong and will not break when accidentally dropped.  Its easy to use--a press of a button puts the meter into action. The back lighting is a good feature.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned that the meter fluctuates and also requires calibration at over-the-top costs.  I cannot testify to this as I am only using the meter to check the temperature and humidity in the rooms in my home. Yes, at initial turn-on, the read fluctuates, but after waiting a few seconds, it settles down into one reading.  I have no alternative in which to test the accuracy of the humidity but, I am not a professional contractor and have no need of such accuracy.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Fluke makes a good sturdy product.  For home use, this Temperature/Humidity Meter is adequate, however, I would heed some of the other reviewers who speak from a professional vantage point.

I have a trash compactor and prior to finding these bags, I used regular ole' trash bags.  Well, big mistake!  Regular bags run down the side of the trash compactor causing more mess and worst of all, I would get my hands all disgusting and dirty from having to readjust the garbage bags at least 1-2x per day.  The bag would rarely stay in place when I turn the compactor on.  After buying real Trash Compactor bags, I never have to get my hands dirty, the bag stays in place and does not rip or tear.  I only have to replace the bag once a week.  That works out to be a dollar a week for headache- free trash disposal!",

I wound up spending my money on the Cabrio because of Whirlpool's reputation and because I had read some great reviews. I've had it for three weeks and I can't explain how much it smells. I've had a Whirlpool Duet front loader that would smell like mildew after about 9 or 10 washes.  This smells like some type of plastic or sulphur and it is so strong it smells up the whole laundry room and this is after every load.  We've run the Affresh and Tide cleaners as well as bleach through it which helps temporarily but after you do another load of laundry, that terrible smell comes back.  All Whirlpool has to say about this is to keep washing it, but it is impractical to spend money washing this thing every three days.<br /><br />I think it gets the clothes clean okay, but its pretty hard on them.  I've noticed a lot of loose threads on my towels and clothes since using this washer, so I wouldn't trust it for your gentles.  Bottom line: If I could get rid of this washer, I would. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to do so. So I spent a ton of money for a machine that makes my whole laundry room reek after any use.  Luckily it doesn't make the clothes smell yet - maybe because we take them out right away, but my laundry room is on the second floor and now I have to keep the door closed to keep the odor in.<br /><br />Honestly, the washer looks really cool, but it smells really bad. Don't spend the money on this washer!!",

    "text": "I am a serious home French pastry chef. Five years ago I bought the then-current version of this stove. My main interest was the convection oven. Indeed, this oven is extremely good in even baking. There were many other features I liked, although I found the controls a bit confusing. For guests and first timers, the controls can be VERY confusing. I would still have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />I bought this new version for a different home. There is one change that I find so annoying that I downgraded this new model in my view to 4 stars. This is the temperature readout for the main oven.<br /><br />On most digital readouts, including the earlier version of this stove, you start by setting the target temperature. Then as the oven heats up, it shows the actual temp. This gives you an idea of how much longer you need to wait. If you are cooking something at a non-critical 350 degrees, you might just put it in at 325. Similarly, if you open the oven, say to turn a tray, you know exactly how much the temp has dropped. Not with this new version.<br /><br />You set the target temp, then wait for a long beep to tell you the oven has reached the<br /><br />target temp. There is no way to tell the current temp. While heating up, some lights flash in an incomprehensible sequence. Neither the manual nor Fridigaire customer support could explain what those lights mean. Even with a totally manual oven (like the small side oven here), you can get an idea of current temp by rotating the knob and listening for the thermostat click.<br /><br />Another downgrade was the minimum temp setting on the old oven was 100 degrees, a sometimes useful setting in baking. The minimum on this oven is 150.<br /><br />I wrote to Frigidaire, an actual letter to the director of marketing with the comments above. He never replied.<br />____________________________<br />A belated followup: It took a while, but eventually I did get some very helpful responses from Frigidaire customer support and their marketing department. I am very happy with the stove.",

Again, I thought this would make the coffee weaker, it does not!! I assume because of the solid bottom, coffee rinses out great!!!<br />4th,the lid seems to not be made a weak as the others!!

    "text": "I've had this for about 3 weeks now, and so far it's been absolutely amazing!  One of the first things I was anxious to try was making hamburgers, which while they lack that dark flame-grilled look and taste you get on an outside grill, they are well cooked and juicy in just a few minutes!  I tried it with the metal pan that comes with the oven first, but then I bought the grille tray made for this oven (comes separately from the GE website, which had the best online price) and they came out even better because the ridges in the tray lift them up out of the cooking juices/grease.  Since Mom lives with me, it's great to have a very user-friendly interface.  I was replacing a Thermidor double oven, and this one is SO much quieter!  Another reviewer noted that the preheat time is a little longish, and while I agree, the speed cook function for many foods that doesn't require preheating due to the instant halogen heat in the upper Advantium oven.  I bought this model on the recommendation of a neighbor who adores hers, and I must say the advice was spot-on!  I'm very happy with it.  Also...the lighting is terrific!  I can actually see the progress dinner is making without having to open up the door.  The only advice I would give you is that since the lighting is LED, your food won't look as brown as it would in an older oven with incandescent lighting which is not as bright, so at first you might be tempted to overcook things a bit while looking for that nice golden-brown on your muffins or what have you.  The automatic settings for weight and food type have worked well for me so far, and the defrost mode is almost as good as my old Samsung over-the-range microwave (which was the be all-end all of microwaves for me, but won't fit in my new kitchen).  It comes with a cookbook that has speed-cook adjusted recipes, and I have found that Pinterest has several as well.  I haven't had it long enough to need to customize or convert any recipes to speed cook mode, but there are so many settings for food types, quantity and weight that I may not need to.  Overall this has been a great new oven, and it's so much fun everybody in the house wants to try it (lucky me!).  I think you'll enjoy it.",

I feel that it lets the air circulate around the leaves and it's not a soggy mess like a tea bag can be after it sits for awhile.<br /><br />A definite must have for any tea lover!!<br /><br />Update***  I use this often and have ordered a second one!

When that happens, you'll have the pump on hand instead of having to wait days for it to arrive.<br /><br />Be careful of the seller or you run the risk of getting a non OEM part. While the price varies, I paid about $9 more and picked Amazon itself as the seller versus any of the other &quot;fulfilled by Amazon&quot; orders which are a grab bag of vendors.

The hardest part is replacing the rubber drain collar around the door. Once you get that, it's game on.<br /><br />A few tips:<br />Save all the screws and put them back into the same hole you removed them from. For instance, when you take the front off, put the loose screw back a just a few turns into its hole. There's about a dozen screws, all different, and all hard to tell apart once they're jumbled up.<br /><br />Make sure you clean all the parts you've removed. The washer gets a lot of scale, funk, fumunda cheese, etc. in all the internals. It's nasty.

The manufacturer said they'll remove >99% of chloramine. The first filter performed as it should (at half the life of stated.) The second filter did not. Maybe 50 gallons in, I brewed a few batches of beer using water filtered by the Swift Green Filter. It developed the tell tale off flavor of chlorophenols within a few weeks. As did a second batch, and a third batch. In beer, chloramines turn into off flavors that a person can detect at even the most minute amounts. I know its the filter. The only thing that changed was the filter.<br /><br />This makes me wonder about the quality and consistency of the filter.

But it has a small capacity. I got one bath robe in there. Best for small delicates, and then you still hang dry. Spins 10x faster than machine spin cycle...so it gets more water out, but not 100% dry unless it's sheer materials, etc. Large size, about the size of a kitchen trash can. Wobbles like crazy first 20 seconds if unbalanced, so take a sec and push things down and around bottom. Works great for last 3 months, once-a-day use. I tried using it as a pre-dryer step and it took too long because of the limited capacity. It was like 5 mins x 4 loads, because of capacity. Dryer gets done in 30-45mins one load.

Blankets now are the only thing I have to take to the laundromat which means I only have to go maybe once a month now. Yay!<br /><br />Whoever engineered this washer should get a raise. At least two times, we have been filling the wash tub with water from the shower head and forgotten it. This washer is engineered so that overflow from the wash tub drains into the spin tub and when this spin tub gets too full, it automatically flows out through the drain hose ... and into my bathtub. I realized what I had done and raced back into the bathroom expecting to find a flood and instead found water draining into my tub harmlessly (except to waste water) and no mess.<br /><br />Best $100 I've spent on washing laundry and has paid for itself already at least 5X over!",

It's built of top quality material and extremely easy to clean. When cleaning the pod screen, be very gentle because all you need to do is clean out the coffee grinds and wash it by hand with a little dish soap. The lid screws down so you don't have to worry about exploding flimsy pods. If you're looking for a top quality reusable pod, this is it. In fact, buy a few because if word gets out, Keurig might stop manufacturing these. If my review helps you, please click HELPFUL. Thank you",

I didn't decide to change out the pump because it was working.  The fan was spinning so why replace something that isn't broke?  So after going through the laundry list of items to check for with nothing resolving the issue, I decided to just purchase a new pump.  What did I have to lose?<br /><br />Long story short, it worked!  So for those trying to figure out the drain issue on your washing machine and thinking that you've already checked your pump because it was spinning and sounded like it was working, think again.  For ~$25, this was well worth the price as it was an easy replacement.  At least I cleaned ALL of the hoses in the process of figuring out what the issue was.  Now I have a brand new washing machine (well like-new)!<br /><br />UPDATE!!!<br /><br />After a little over a year (13 months to be exact), the plastic fan broke away from the motor portion of the pump.  Might have to look for a better quality pump‚Ä¶ :(",

It looks and works as advertised - sits on top of the stove's backpanel; is flexible to allow it to fit slightly different stove configuations; is magnetic so it stays in place on the metal backpanel; and lets you organize spices, small utensils (like can openers), or whatever you want ready to hand as you are cooking.  The rubberized surface is a nice touch, as it keeps things from slipping and sliding around as you try to pick them up.  It feels and looks like it should stand up to use - not cheap light plastic.  Overall - an easy 5 stars.  (It may seem a tad pricy; but probably a case of you get what you pay for....)",
